Welcome to Data Science for Business Applications!

The objective of this course is for you to gain the tools you need to tackle real-world problems from a quantitative perspective. We will be covering topics on regression modelling, causal inference, and predictive modelling. You will have the opportunity to be exposed to an array of different real-world examples, get hands-on experience in working with data, and improve your R coding skills for data science.
