Here I have some Rmarkdown resources for anyone who is interested (it assumes you have a basic knowledge of Rmarkdown). I've included a template with multiple comments, so hopefully it can be easily customized.

I am using `bookdown` for this (given that many people want to export these files as PDFs), but I also included the HTML output, if you want to opt for that. You can also find the `style.css` file in the Github repository.

Also, for other resources regarding PDF output, I've included a couple of suggestions at the end of the document that I think are awesome.
