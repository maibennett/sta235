Some important news, data, and articles to highlight.

## R resources

For those that want some R refresher, these resources can be useful:

- [YouTube Playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8Yi9OGQMf2EFHkS8-n5AXuaFpD_rXdoA) by Prof. James Scott, used in STA 301.

- [An introduction to R](https://stat545.com/) (with a focus on the tidyverse) by Jenny Bryan.

- [A ModernDive into R and the tidyverse](https://moderndive.com/index.html) (by Ismai and Kim).

- [R for the Rest of Us](https://rfortherestofus.com/resources/). (by David Keyes)

Cheatsheets for R are amazing! Here are two of my favorite so you can look up functions we will be using frequently explained in a simple way:

- [Data Visualization with ggplot2: Cheatsheet](https://sta235.netlify.com/images/data-visualization.pdf)

- [Data Transformation with dplyr: Cheatsheet](https://sta235.netlify.com/images/data-transformation.pdf)

<!-- ## Multiple Regression

- [Regression Models with Multiple Regressors](https://www.econometrics-with-r.org/6-rmwmr.html) by C. Hanck et al. (2020), from their book *Introduction to Econometrics with R*
	- It also includes some R resources!

## Machine Learning

- ["Hands-On Machine Learning"](https://bradleyboehmke.github.io/HOML/) by B. Boehmke & B. Greenwell (2020). *Note: Great resource to see different packages for bagging, random forests, and boosting, beyond what we have seen in class!* -->
