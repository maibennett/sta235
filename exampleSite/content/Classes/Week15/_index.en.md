## Trivia

This are the slides for the review session this week.

*Note: If you are a Mac user, you might get different results in Random Forests, because of the way `ranger` uses the RNG. Do not worry about it, because that will be considered in your submissions (Canvas shows who is running a Mac or Windows machine).*
