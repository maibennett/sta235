## Final Trivia

This final week will just be a review session in the #FinalTrivia format. Form groups and answer the questions provided! Slides with the answers will be posted Wednesday afternoon.

*Note: If you are a Mac user, you might get different results in Random Forests, because of the way `ranger` uses the RNG. Do not worry about it, because that will be considered in your submissions (Canvas shows who is running a Mac or Windows machine).*
