1,8-Apr-18,5,"I love candles so much that most every day I'm either ... Yankee Candle Company candles used to see so high priced to be before I began buying candles. I love candles so much that most every day I'm either enjoying a fragrant candle or wishing I'd ordered more. Less expensive candles burn fast and often leave a black stain on the ceiling above. Or when you put them out you'll see dark smoke that kind of makes you wonder if burning candles is a smart thing to do for your living environment. The minute I began buying these Yankee Candle Company candles I realized they burn very clean and burn for about three times the length of a traditional brand. I bought 3 of these and my large apartment smells like a Christmas cookie but not so strong that the sweetness is overwhelming. I love to relax in bed, with my dog, Logan, at my side, and enjoy the beauty, fragrance and relaxation that only Yankee candle delivers always. If you can find these on sale and if the ratings are great then you should be making a purchase right now. I hope this helps. I don't receive anything in return for a review. Just a happy camper with these candles. And I'm a dude!"
1,8-Nov-18,1,"Not up to par. Would not recommend. Dissatisfied purchase. All Yankee Candle products I have bought in the past have been fantastic, however, these particular candles gave off relatively no scent. Would compare it to a cheap Walmart brand candle and wouldn‚Äôt recommend."
1,1-Feb-18,5,the Fresh Scent of a Northern Forest the scent was so perfect for the holiday season and now after - they last and last and last - chose not to do a tree and the scent of this candle allowed me to have the fresh scent of a Christmas Tree without the work and clean up - the candle was so satisfying I purchased another a week later for the back of the house.
1,4-Dec-18,1,"Smelled Bad I purchased three of these candles for my aunt (who is located in a different state across the country from where I live) who has severe mobility issues and wears a colostomy bag as a result of cancer treatment. She requested good quality & good smelling candles to help with the smell when she and her caregiver change her bag. I purchased the Balsam & Cedar, Lavender and Sparkling Cinnamon candles thinking that each would offer a pleasant and varied aroma depending on her mood. She was excited to receive the package and quickly tried each of the candles. Both she and her caregiver remarked that all three of the candles smelled ""cheap"", they said that ""they smell like Lysol"" and they're reminiscent of ""dollar store quality candles"". I am exceedingly disappointed. I expect more from Yankee Candle (a brand that I've personally used in my own home and normally have a high opinion of), I expect better quality for candles that cost more than $10 each. At the very least I expect for each of the candle aromas to be distinguishable from one another. Now my aunt is stuck with three terrible smelling candles that she won't use, and I think we can all agree that the situation must be bad if you prefer the smell of human waste to a product designed to freshen the air."
1,18-Jan-18,5,Favorite Yankee candle scent! My absolute favorite Yankee candle scent!  Use it year round.  Nice outdoor/natural scent that isn‚Äôt overpowering.Make sure to burn candle one hour for every diameter inch (approximately 4 inches for large jar) so that the wax melts evenly and you don‚Äôt waste any of the candle wax.
1,9-Sep-18,5,"Excellent candle. This candle transplants me instantly to the dark Canadian wilderness. Trees, pine cones and even a hint of snow come alive in a true treat for your nostrils. Be careful though, Fire is hot!"
1,29-Dec-17,1,Not the same rich cookie fragrance as in the past 2016 Christmas Cookie candles smelled wonderful. I purchased 3 this year and they didn't have near the rich cookie fragrance as it did last year and years before.. Something is definitely different. Disappointing......
1,17-Aug-18,5,Love Balsam & Cedar Balsam & Cedar has always been one of my favorite Yankee scents! I really like this scent for the holidays.Mine arrived in perfect condition and the scent lasted until the was was gone.
1,25-Feb-19,1,Its too bad. I have been burning this fragrance since it came out around 1994. It was the strongest and most beautifully blended Christmas scent that Yankee had put out. I would let it burn during the season and it fill my home with the smells of the season. The label was the most festive next to the Christmas Eve label that you could find from Yankee. Then they changed the Label before the latest change it slowly but since the label change the fragrance was never the same.  It became more of a metallic scent and did not have the depth it did for all the years. It seemed like it had been watered down. The most recent pours have been just a ghost of what it once was. I miss burning it during the holidays and have stopped buying it after 20 years of wonderful Christmases.  Im sorry all the people now buying it that give it 5 stars didn't know the beautiful seasonal scent it once was. But I guess Im glad that it is still purchased. Just wish it was the way it use to be.
1,2-Jan-19,1,"A candle must be smelled in person to be sure it is what you expect in a scent. I bought this thinking I'd have the faint pine scent of a real tree in the house for Christmas.  There were so many glowing reviews and Yankee candles have a good reputation, so I didn't think I could go wrong.  Admittedly, my husband has a sensitivity to smells, but he was right on this one - it didn't have that fresh pine smell.  It reminded me of the car air fresheners of old that people used to hang on their rear view mirrors.  It is much too strong - and not really the mild pine scent I had anticipated.  I gave it to a friend who wanted to try it and told her to donate it if she found they didn't like the scent."
1,20-Jul-18,3,"Three Stars Smells great, but candle arrived misshapen, as seen in photos. Wick not at surface."
1,1-Dec-18,1,No scent No scent.Very disappointing.Have never had this problem with Yankee candles before. Will only buy at Yankee Candle Store in the fuuture. I usually have been pleased with Amazon orders. Not this time
1,28-Oct-18,1,"Waste of money I've bought this scent at a Yankee candle store before, and the product I bought on Amazon isn't the same quality. It doesn't smell at all while burning. Extremely disappointed and a big waste of money."
1,15-Nov-19,4,"Where is the scent? Very weak. Old candles?? First, please know I am a huge Yankee Candle fan. They are my go-to for candles.That being said, I wondered why the Christmas Cookie candle has been such a great price. I ordered one, since I was out of holiday scents. The one I got just was not very powerful.I am not sure if these are just very old stock, or perhaps seconds. Normally, these fill the room with their wonderful scents. With the one I received, you can tell a candle is burning, but you'd never guess the scent (either while burning or after extinguishing it). Very different from my other YC items.So, just know that the price is great, but it might not be a bargain. It's still a nice looking candle; it just falls very short of what I have come to expect from Yankee Candle."
1,15-Dec-18,1,"Smells bad and left my throat scratchy. The candle smelled nothing of cedar or pine, after some hours of letting the candle burn a smell did grow more present in the room but it was more of a stuffy toxic smell and left my throat with a bad scratch so I snuffed it out. I'll be returning the other unused candle and this one too if I can.  I'm inclined to start believing third party claims that these are toxic."
1,3-Dec-18,1,N/A Item was supposed to smell like pine.. hardly any smell at all.calling Amazon tomorrow.return..thought Yankee candles were one of the best.can get more pine smell from car air freshener.
1,23-Dec-19,5,Smells delicious and lasts a long time I ordered this as a mistake for a Christmas gift and decided to keep it. I'm not usually a Yankee candle customer as I prefer a different brand. I didn't have high hopes for the scent to last or really permeate a large living room but I was wrong. I lit it in our basement den which is large and open to several other rooms. Within 30 minutes all of the rooms downstairs smelled great and it was beginning to drift upstairs. My poor husband thought I was baking cookies!
1,31-Jan-20,2,"Yankee Candles just aren‚Äôt any good anymore. For a Yankee Candle, and the price I paid, I was very disappointed. The smell was non-existent. I thought Yankee were once the best? Apparently greed must have killed them like it does so many businesses these days. You get people running the biz that want to start using cheaper quality materials to make more profit, and they raise prices to ridiculous levels because people love their products. Only they don‚Äôt realize people aren‚Äôt as stupid as they hoped. The people begin to realize that they just aren‚Äôt as good as they once were and they are WAY out of the ballpark now for the Quality to Cost ratio. So people try another brand and go wow, that‚Äôs a great candle! And they never go back. They then talk to their friends about it and the friends ‚Äúwake up‚Äù and go ‚Äúyour right, their candles just aren‚Äôt that great anymore. Their prices have gotten ridiculous anyway.‚Äù It is now that they switch too over to that other brand that really knows how to make a great smelling candle, that stays smelling great, until the last bit of life leaves the flame on the wicks.I know for a fact that this happens as stated above. It is from direct experiences on my part, multiple times as well. I even started polling our friends and the majority of them actually verified the same sentiment. That Yankee Candles, which used to be everyone‚Äôs favorite,  have gone downhill so badly and have gotten so crazy expensive, that it just does not make sense to keep wasting the amount of time I have to work to pay for them. I work hard. I want quality for my money and time. I‚Äôm not going to spend an hour working to throw away on garbage. Companies don‚Äôt respect the people who work to pay their salaries. The only thing they care about is my money and not the time I slaved at work just to purchase their crappy product. What happened to the days when ‚Äúcustomers come FIRST‚Äù? They‚Äôre gone and now it‚Äôs only about taking your money/time and passing it on to the fat executive that‚Äôs destroying their brand, just to make themselves and their greedy shareholders fatter and richer off the backs of those who do the REAL work in this world.... just for the privilege of buying their overpriced trinkets."
1,7-Feb-17,5,"Exactly as it should be from Yankee - the smell warms the whole house. I purchased this candle as a ME gift. A one time purchase for each member of Amazon. Received it quickly, it was wrapped very securely as to avoid breakage. No one make a room or even house smell this good. I live in a large home and lite this about 1.5 hours until my husband came home. He came in and the first thing he said was how great the house smelled. Thank you Amazon!"
1,12-Dec-19,1,"does not seem to be genuine This candle does not smell like a fresh candle.  Very weak fragrance when not lit and no noticeable fragrance when burning.  This is a waste of money.  It doesn't smell like a genuine Yankee candle, I think it's a fake.buyer beware"
1,29-Mar-20,5,"Don't take anything for granted. The weirdst thing. Ordered it today at 15 dollars, 2 days later Amazon: ""something happened during delivery"" we will refund your money. I proceed go try to buy it again and it now costs 17 dollars. All that so that YOU start ordering and getting what YOU NEED and NOT WHAT YOU WANT, Especially AT THIS DIFFICULT TIME. WE are all here to serve a purpose and NOT to take advantage of others. Corona virus COVID19 today is a wake up call to all of you who take Life and People's service and kindness for granted.Sincerely, a lover of Amazon (as a customer) and a current employee. I have been with them for a while and most people in there work harder than you will ever now.Sincerely,ST*And I will buy the item and pay the price of stupid peoples mistakes""Thanks selfish hoarders.Love your neighbor, Love Yoursef. ?üåª?üòä"
1,17-Dec-18,5,"*Notes included* Macintosh with a little Spice *Notes include*Top Notes: Golden Apples, Cinnamon Leaf, CloveMid Notes:Apple Peel, Cracked Walnuts, Brown SugarBase Notes: Amber, Melted Butter, Maple Syrup, VanillaThis candle is a must for the holidays. It's great because it's Macintosh with a little spice. Not too much but enough to let you know it's a festive candle. On a side note, I can't smell cloves. I hate cloves but love this candle. Has decent throw."
1,23-Nov-19,1,"Waste of Money I‚Äôm so disappointed! I should have known better when I found my favorite Yankee candle scent for so cheap on Amazon. There is barely any scent. I‚Äôve been burning the candle for 3 hours and unless you walk right up to it, you‚Äôd never know it was scented. Save your money and buy directly from YC or one or their retailers."
1,8-Feb-19,5,"not cute, but smells great & lasts long. I‚Äôll start out be saying that I‚Äôm the guy that will spend [maybe too much] money on a candle that smells good and is aesthetically pleasing to the eye. Don‚Äôt tell anyone.That being said, I have this candle on a ‚Äúsubscribe & save‚Äù monthly delivery. It may not look the best, but the label peels off easily and the smell competes with the super-expensive Thymes Frasier Fir candles. It‚Äôs a light, clean, fresh cedar/pine scent and fills our living area. Lasts about a month if you burn it for several hours daily."
1,23-Sep-20,1,"Arrived with no wick!! Candle arrived with no wick. I love yankee candles and order them frequently. I‚Äôve never had this problem before. I got a knife out to see if perhaps the wick was under the surface, but no. What a waste of money."
1,9-Dec-18,1,"Don't waste your money! I've owned this Yankee Candle fragrance previously and loved, it as it smelled like fresh cut Christmas tree and not pine floor cleaner.  We have an artificial tree and my husband still wants the aroma he remembers from his childhood.  I don't know what went wrong with this batch of candles but they don't fill the room with the lovely scent my previous Yankee Candle purchases have.  You virtually have to stand right next to it to smell it.  Jokes on me because I bought two of them thinking I would use one and have one at the ready.  Tossed all the packaging as I never dreamed they wouldn't be the same quality product that Yankee Candle is supposed to produce."
1,2-Jan-17,1,"Maybe this batch is bad, or I got a fake product I've been using Yankee candles for 2 years, it's always reliable. But this time, the candle I got is strange. First, the smell is so so so weak compare to previous Yankee candles I've used. Second, there is heavy black smoke coming out of it when using. I stop using it because I am afraid the smoke will turn the white wall black. Maybe this batch is bad, or I got a fake product."
1,7-Dec-16,5,"Love this old classic Bayberry Scent I have looked at every Yankee Candle Co. seller, from Bed, Breakfast and Beyond to my local department store which carries a large candle department without success, for the Bayberry Candle that my mother always burned during the holiday season when I was growing up, and also, I burned for many years..however apparently the scent has become less popular for the ONLY place I found it was at the Yankee Candle Co itself thru Amazon.I was hoping to purchase several candles at a lower price during the Black Friday sales...but I simply couldn't locate this specific scent.I ended up paying full price..so I bought 3 of the, in hopes of having one to start 2017 holiday season with.I love this scent..it brings back so many childhood memories and I'm sure it will for my adult kids also..wish I could afford to buy one for each of my family members but at $28.00 per candle, it's too much of a cost just for a 'nice scent'.I wish Yankee Candle Co would distribute this classic holiday scent to the stores again."
1,28-Jul-18,1,"Not what I'd expected... I'd anticipated getting a jarred candle, but instead, discovered a really nicely-scented potential wind chime. I'm pretty bummed; it didn't come anywhere near surviving the trip and it'll have to go back."
1,11-Mar-20,5,"Deliciously sweet, vanilla-ey fragrance I seem to be getting good longevity (burn-hours) for this candle and I enjoy the ""sugar cookie baking"" smell. It has decent candle ""throw"" but I think it could be better? It has a single wick and the top of the jar is slightly tapered, so this may hinder that, I don't know. It doesn't smoke if you start with a slightly trimmed wick before lighting it, but I wouldn't call it smokeless. That would make it ideal. I got a great price after the holidays so I can't complain. I would not pay full-price for it, though."
1,28-Nov-18,4,"Warm cozy scent I'm generally a huge fan of Yankee Candles--they smell better and last longer than any other candles out there. That said, I wish this scent was a little stronger. It smells fantastic--but it just isn't very strong."
1,4-Jun-20,4,No scent I'm getting a little disappointed with Yankee candles and wax melts lately..I don't know if it's because they are old or they aren't making them strong scented anymore but everytime I use the melts and burn candles their is no smell to it at all..I may have to find a new candle company..?üòï
1,3-Nov-20,1,"No scent at all I burned this candle for 3 hrs & it gave off no scent, at all.I grew up in MA where authentic Yankee Candles were manufactured. The reason everyone paid extra was for the extraordinary scent, which filled the New England homes.I bought 2 of these & neither of them give off any scent.Dollar store candles are better than these.Do Not  Buy"
1,13-Nov-20,5,"My favorite candle scent EVER Every year around this time, I treat myself to a large Balsam & Cedar Yankee Candle. It is my absolute favorite scent.Last year, I didn't buy one, thinking that I could try different pine scents in my wax burner. I tried four.... yeah, four... different brands, and they smelled like bad cologne.I really can't describe it, but this scent is beautifully woodsy... but softer, sweeter.... it is the best."
1,16-Nov-20,5,"Smells Amazing!! This is one of my favorite candles to buy around the holiday season. It smells strongly of balsam and cedar, but it's not overpowering. I buy this every season and off-season if available. I would recommend if you love the smell of fresh Christmas trees. It is also perfect if you don't have real trees during the holiday and want that fresh pine smell in your house."
1,14-Nov-19,5,Great Holiday Scent Christmas Eve use to be my favorite Yankee Candle scent. Last year I decided to try the Balsam and Cedar and I absolutely love it. It reminds me of the Christmases years ago when we had a live tree instead of artificial. I have a cat and dog and this scent helps to cover any odor they leave behind. I purchased 4 because of the great discount offered. Thanks for that Amazon.
1,12-Dec-19,1,"No scent I have tons of yankee candles and this smell is so weak it‚Äôs like a cheap candle. Usually yankee scents are quite loud, especially this particular scent, but it smells like nothing. Beginning to wonder if their amazon candles are like defects or expired."
1,1-Jul-20,3,"Delightful smell! I was absolutely delighted when I received this candle. The scent was heavenly, and the size Is perfect. Big, but not too big! However, much to my surprise, and for the very first time in buying this brand of candle for 30 years, this candle had two defects. Not even halfway down the candle wick ran out, and the wax was actually bubbly. Just filled with little tiny bubbles throughout the entire candle. I must say again, I was truly surprised. But one product in 30 years isn‚Äôt bad. Normally, it‚Äôs an exemplary Product. This is why I will pay the price."
1,22-Mar-18,5,"Great, fresh - burns long and clean This candle has a strong smell, but it's not overpowering. I burn this scent at Christmas time since I'm not a huge fan of sweeter scents like vanilla or Christmas cookie. This things burns clean and seems to last forever - I burned this for a few hours most days of the week during the holidays, and it's barely half used. It's also such a clean scent that you could easily use this outside of the holiday season. Unlike some customers, mine came packaged very well, and I didn't have any issues with breakage. All in all a great scent, whether for the holidays or year-round."
1,22-Dec-19,5,Love it!! Love this candle and what a great price! Such a better deal than buying the large jar size in the store. Very happy with it and it has an amazing smell.
1,16-Jul-16,3,"FRAGRANCE OIL AND COLOR LEAKED FROM CANDLE DURING SHIPMENT This forest scent was piney and natural, and I have no complaints about the candle itself, but during shipment in June, some of the evergreen fragrance oils leaked out of the jar and then ate completely through the styrofoam packing material cushioning the cap of the jar. The substance wasn't melted wax, but was actual green coloring plus oil that leached OUT of the wax. This is indicative to me either that there was a problem with product quality control or that Amazon should not have been shipping it to my location (Texas) in June, I purchased another scent (Cranberry Twist) that shipped in the same box, and it was fine with no leakage. Because this leakage changed the contents, I felt it compromised the safety of the candle, and I don't feel safe burning it."
1,21-Sep-20,2,"Not as odorific as the old ones! The old Christmas Cookie candles were more potent and made your whole house smell like cookies.  These are still a great smell, but not as potent.  Miss the old vintage."
1,7-Jan-20,5,Smells amazing As miss I try to consistently give other (smaller companies) candles a chance; Yankee seems to always out scent them!This candle looks and smells great.The 2 wick is more aromatic than single wick but not nauseating- so spend your money there.Balsam fit during January while it‚Äôs snowing outside simply can‚Äôt be beat
1,8-Dec-18,1,"Doesn't smell at all Has no smell when lit. Really disappointed. The basalm and cedar candle smelled for the first few hours and now does not smell as well. Meanwhile, I have a Village Candle I got for 10 dollars at Marshalls that's over halfway through and smells extremely strong. Yankee Candles are a scam now..."
1,14-Dec-18,5,"Love Yankee Candles I have always loved Yankee candles. Yes, they are more expensive than most of the other candles out there but the quality and the smell does make up for the cost. This candle was perfect to complement our home christmas decorations and helped us get in the holiday mood."
1,8-Feb-20,5,Worth the extra cost vs cheaper candles This thing smells amazing and lasted for DAYS burning it at 10-12 hours per day. We bought three and it adequately scented ~3000 sq ft. We've used cheaper candles but they seem to burn fast or aren't able to provide enough scent to reach all corners of our open floorplan. These did a GREAT job!
1,16-Nov-20,2,"Came in all broken, smells amazing It smells AMAZING, but it was all broken when I opened it. I was incredibly sad about that because I got it to give to my boyfriend. obviously it is not giftable, so I got a replacement (not here yet). Even though it was all broken, it is still OK to burn. It‚Äôs currently burning in our kitchen and our whole house smells like Christmas!!"
1,29-Feb-20,5,"Classic scent, can‚Äôt go wrong! No need for smell test Classic scent, great go to without the smell test! Bought for my single adult brother and his roommate, because he needs some womanly things and who else would buy them besides his sister! I knew and trusted this scent through years of experience with brand and flavor and he confirmed just how incredible his house smells now!"
1,20-Jan-19,5,"My daughter's favorite scent Yankee candles are simply the best. They burn nice, smell amazing and are always a favorite. My daughter loves them, so when they run specials I always try and stock up for gifts. She mentioned them on sale on Cyber Monday so I bought a few. I will slowly give them to her, so that she has Christmas cookie smell all year long."
1,4-Apr-17,1,"Faint scent I ordered two of these candles because I had one of these already, but when they came I discovered that the candles were ""updated"" with no essential oils and the scent was not nearly as strong. I loved this candle so much and wanted to love the new ones I ordered, but the difference was obvious...hardly no scent. Even my family noticed the difference. I returned both of these candles. Very disappointed."
1,6-Nov-20,3,"Better Homes & Gardens is...better I like most of Yankee Candle's products, but this barely has any scent.  I know it was a flash-sale item, but I'm bummed about it.  WoodWick is almost always worth the money, so I'd recommend them for expensive candles.  If you want the cheaper version, with an equally pleasant scent, I try Better Homes & Gardens."
1,18-Nov-20,1,Is this really a Yankee candle? I have been buying Yankee candles for years. Everyone knows they have a fairly strong scent that will fill the room. This candle barely smells at all. Complete waste of money in my opinion. I have never bought one on amazon so not sure if that‚Äôs why but I‚Äôm extremely disappointed.
1,23-Dec-18,1,"Soy or Wax?? I thought I did my study between soy or wax,,,Soy burns clean and no residue let behind,,but not much of a bang on sent...Wax burns longer but not complete but seems to put out twice the sent as soy,,,I guess is buyers choice,,,Oh..and buy the way wax smalls good without having to be lit.....GOOD LUCK!!"
1,31-Oct-20,2,"Yankee Candle without Balsam & Cedar Scent I am very disappointed, I buy Yankee candles often. Though the delivery was very fast ?üåü?üåü?üåü?üåü?üåüThere s no scent coming from the candle. It‚Äôs been burning for 6 hours, a day, and unfortunately I, and my family don‚Äôt smell the scent. I will be contacting the vendor. I know this isn‚Äôt their fault, by no means. I would hope, by contacting them, they will send me a replacement. Other than this unfortunate situation, Yankee Candles, by far are the best scented candles."
1,8-Nov-16,1,Terrible Disappointment...... I ordered this candle from amazon and expected the same high quality and awesome fragrance I have gotten every other holiday season when I purchased directly from Yankee Candle Co. retail stores.  This one ordered from Amazon have NO fragrance whatsoever when lit.  We are totally disappointed in the product and find it NOT of Yankee Candle quality.  Don't buy !!!!!
1,30-Mar-20,5,Most pleasing aroma. Aaaahhhhh! I love the Yankee candles.  The scent permeates a room and beyond with good circulation.  Many candles don't do that. With others you have to xbend close to the burning candle to get the scent. After an hour or so left burning the essence extends from my living room and down the hallway. We have a small ranch style home. Very pleasant ?üëç?üòä
1,25-Dec-18,5,Heavenly purchase Xmas n Beyond. Yankee Cancel a favorite .. this fragrance delights you with the warmest loving fragrance .  Labels peel off can use to store dried flowes tie a bow n what a love gift.  Burning time so far 5 days constantly.  Bought teb .. Will puchase more.  Heavenly all year.  Sale was great help.
1,14-Oct-17,1,"NO SMELL THE CANDLES DO NOT LINGER WITH THE LONG LASTING SMELL AS THE OTHER YANKEE CANDLES I OWN, VERY UPSET WITH THE PURCHASE OF THESE, MUST BE OLD OR HAVE BEEN IN A WAREHOUSE FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME, I HAVE NEVER HAD THIS ISSUE BEFORE WITH YANKEE. THESE DO NOT LINGER AND FILL THE ROOM WITH THE CHRISTMAS SMELL AT ALL. SO SAD!!!!"
1,25-Oct-20,5,Smells like a Christmas tree!?üéÑ?üòÉ This candle is i think the best one we have ever gotten. We burned it right before Thanksgiving and Christmas!!! It smells like a Christmas tree and it makes it feel like Christmas already! I highly recommend this candle if you like the smell of Christmas trees.?üéÑ?üòÉ
1,25-Nov-18,1,Bad buy So disappointed. Bought this for some Christmas smells and it doesn‚Äôt smell like anything. Most Xmas thing about it is that it‚Äôs green. Try a different candle.
1,13-Jun-16,3,"Not bad, securely packed! :) Very light aroma subtle even, minty smells like something green.  I even forgot the candle was on. It was on for a while before I smelled something. I wanted something stronger and overpowering. For the price $11.50 for 22oz I couldn't resist and took the risk. My Glade candles are smaller and smell stronger and more widespread throughout the home more rapidly.Bigger doesn't always mean better I realize. Seems like it gives off more of a fragrance after I blow the candle out? Interestingly odd-- lol Pleasant fragrance once the fragrance settles after blowing out the candle a waxy odor is present like something was burning (not a bad smell but a waxy odor)"
1,6-Dec-19,1,No scent I love yankee candles. It‚Äôs the only brand I buy. This one gives off no scent. I bought another scent as well and it gives off no scent either. These were cheaper then normal price which is why I bought them. I don‚Äôt think they are real.
1,6-Dec-19,5,Puts me in the Christmas mood I bought this candle for the Christmas tree smell.  I'm not a fan of real trees but I absolutely love how real trees smell and these candles makes my home smell like I have a fresh cut Christmas tree.  The scent makes my home smell warm and cozy and puts my household in a more Christmassy feel.  The candle scent is light and not overpowering but strong yet subtle enough to be smelt though out the entire house.  One candle last for several hours and several uses.  The candle is a good price for the number of uses I will get.
1,10-May-19,5,"Smell Good Even When Unlit These look and smell great - and smell great in the heat circulating from a ""fake fireplace heater"" and when on a warm day the sun streams through the window on top of them and I am sitting down to eat.  I have to note that I prefer this ""Brand"" because other candles have given me headaches - so though they are more costly - I am sure that the cost went into making a product that smells good and is more ""friendly"" to more people ""scent wise""."
1,19-Nov-20,3,"Attractive but barely any fragrance The candle burns well, like all Yankee candles. However, the scent was so subtle that I could only catch the faintest scent even after burning it for a couple hours. Compared to another Yankee candle I tested afterward, this one was incredibly disappointing. I would suggest trying another brand if you are looking for a good candy cane scented candle."
1,19-Jan-20,5,"Yankee candles are top notch This has been lasting me regular burns throughout the early 1/3 of winter so far. The scent and appearance are lovely and cozy, and a nice perfume of sweet cookies, that go well with the winter. Other brands I‚Äôve tried with cheaper candles have not been so elegant in their burning and scent and longevity. ....I want more!!!!"
1,7-Nov-20,4,"Great scent, wicks aren't long enough I like the smell a great deal. I've always been partial to cedar and they got the scent just right. However the wicks in the candle aren't quite long enough, which makes it a little tricky to light without burning my fingers on the match, and also causes the melting wax to cause the flame to sputter. It lasts about half an hour before the flame has nearly burned out.On the other hand there's a great deal of wonderfully scented candle and I expect it to last a couple months, even burning a few hours a day. If balsam and cedar is your thing then this is probably worth the price tag."
1,7-Nov-19,5,"Holiday Bayberry Love Holiday Bayberry.  This scent's delightful spiciness in particular sets all my brain pleasure centers, neurons and synapses aglow or afire.  Great throw with a traditional and classic green clean scent.  I also recommend Mistletoe."
1,5-Dec-18,5,"No need for a Christmas tree with this candle Upon lighting this candle my apartment transformed into a spruce tree farm. Because of this candle I don‚Äôt enter the outside world, I‚Äôve lost countless friends because of cancelled plans, and I‚Äôm pretty sure I‚Äôve ingested an unhealthy amount of wax/candle fumes. The scent is incredible. My only complaint is that it‚Äôs not strong enough to mask the explosive smells coming from my cats liter box."
1,11-Apr-18,5,"Great price, too This is my Christmas scent.  We burn it all of December.  Great price, too.  I always use Yankee Candles.  I can count on them to fill my Great Room with a good smell."
1,19-Nov-20,5,"It‚Äôs Yankee Candle of course it‚Äôs 5star amazing Yankee Candle is ALWAYS my go to,last time I tried a new brand (Happy Wax wax melts) regretted it Yankee candle always has the perfect balance the perfect scents that actually fill your desired area I just found it odd that the wick was a little short maybe it was pre trimmed or maybe it‚Äôs just me but found it odd I hope it‚Äôll burn as well as all my other Yankee Candles and I can‚Äôt wait to get my Yankee candle waxes either! The scent of Red Apple Wreath is incredible the longevity is amazing no complaints other than odd about the wick being so small."
1,9-Oct-20,2,"Smells almost perfumey but strong scent I got the balsam one but the scent isnt exactly foresty but more perfume-like which kinda irritates my nose a little. After burning it for a while, I just cant stand the smell. It's a great price for the quantity but I'm not sure if this is the best balsam/cedar scent."
1,16-Jan-20,4,Yankee Doodle Yankee candles are a wonderful addition to the interior of your home and with all their array of scents everyone is bound to find something they love.  MY only wish is the prices would be fairly reasonable because it's not always easy to convince yourself to buy a $20 candle that probably won't last a month. Yankee candles do create a great product and never fails to disappoint.  (only when it comes to how much they charge). Mahalo!
1,12-Jan-20,4,"Too strong and artificial smelling. I love candles that smell like Christmas trees! This one, however was a little too strong for my preference. It almost reminded me of the overpowering little tree air fresheners for cars. I can be sensitive to some smells and when they are too strong, I get headaches. This was one is those scents that produced or enhanced my head aches. Because I don‚Äôt like to waste candles, this is going in my garage to help freshen it up."
1,17-Dec-19,5,"Good product! I was really worried about the candle coming in broken or something being wrong as i read from the other reviews, but this product came in perfect! Packaged in really good protective casings so mine wasn't even chipped. I ordered christmas cookie, which always has a good strong smell for most of its duration, but warning towards the end of the wax burning the smell definitely lessons. if you like vanilla smells but dont want it to be overpowering (like the vanilla cupcake candle they have) this is a great alternative."
1,2-Dec-19,5,"Bringing back the holiday memories! I LOVE Yankee candle so much and bought two Balsam & Cedar scented jars to burn during my cold wintry days.! I'm so happy with them, they're lasting and smell so much like my fireplace hearth, fresh cut Christmas tree childhood memories! I'll be back for more holiday ambience soon:)) ‚òÉÔ?è"
1,6-Mar-20,5,A Child's Christmas in South Carolina. I loved the smell. it spelled like Christmas at my home. My Mother always burned tese candles to evoke the Christmas season.
1,20-Jan-20,5,"The best real tree smell I‚Äôve found! I‚Äôve tried a lot of candles trying to find that ‚ÄúChristmas tree‚Äù smell. They were all too soapy or too smoky and gave me a headache. Mistletoe is perfect! We buy one every year because it is the most pleasant real tree smell without being overpowering. Try it, it‚Äôs worth it!"
1,11-Apr-18,5,"Perfect Candle. Perfect Scent. This is not a scent for everyone, but I like the rich, heavy smell. I close my eyes and picture myself back in Maine. The candle burns flawlessly. I'm already working my second one."
1,2-Apr-20,5,"Best Christmas Candle My favorite candles from Yankee Candle are Pink Sands and Black Cherry, but when Christmas rolls around, it's always Red Apple Wreath for me. I just can't get enough. It's perfect: not too sweet, not too pine/tree, just the right spice and warmth for the season."
1,24-Nov-19,3,"I did not agree with the smell I bought this awhile ago, and just used it recently to clear the air to my restroom. For some reason, I just could not enjoy the scent of this candle. I've used other scents from Yankee and always enjoyed them. Other than that, it's still a good candle, I would just stay away from this scent."
1,26-Nov-19,1,No scent at all This candle has no scent at all. I placed it in a very small room to test it once I determined it seemed to have no scent. Even in a small place there was no aroma at all. This was the first time I purchased Yankee Candles from Amazon and I was very disappointed. Back to Walmart I guess ‚ò?Ô?è
1,28-Dec-19,2,Disappointed There was no scent to this candle at all. I expected so much more from Yankey. I bought 100.00 plus candles from them and none had a fragrance
1,30-Nov-18,1,broken came in broken  cleaned off the rest of glass and will use candle
1,24-Oct-20,1,"This purchase did not light up my heart. I was SO excited to find my favorite Holiday scent on Amazon so I ordered 4. I bought and received all 4, packaged. When removing them from the boxes I noticed that 3 of the 4 candles had been lit (see wicks). Some may appreciate the removal of any superstitious vibes from the candles by lighting the wick, :P but I was under the impression these were new. Worse than that, I had to use gloves to handle them because they were covered in the scented oil. Super disappointed."
1,11-Nov-20,2,Barely any scent The candle smells good but only if you are standing over it. Anymore than 2 feet away and you can‚Äôt smell it whatsoever. For a 2Wick yankee candle I expected much more
1,25-Jun-19,3,"Small Area It is unfortunate that Yankee Candles do not work as well as they did in the past. I find that the candle does not contain enough scented oils, therefore the only way that you can smell the scent is to be standing or sitting close to it while it is burning. If you're going to use this product, I recommend placing it in a small room."
1,11-Dec-19,1,"I would like my money back This is for the large jar candle that was under $12. The same size one is usually $26.00. I have had Yankee candle balsam and cedar candles before and this is nothing like them. Very disappointed. Scent is very weak. It smells like an old  poor quality  candle from a much cheaper company.  Maybe it‚Äôs just really old. I‚Äôve had it a little longer now and it‚Äôs burned Very quickly.  I only paid $12 for this candle, They didn‚Äôt say anything about it being old or inferior in anyway I just thought it was a sale price.  It wasn‚Äôt worth it. I‚Äôd like my money back."
1,22-Dec-18,5,"Really like the scent of this one I enjoy Yankee candles, especially when I can get them at a good price.  Red Apple Wreath is one of my favorite scents--not too strong or overpowering.  This candle shipped fast, was packaged well and arrived in perfect condition.  I will definitely be back to purchase again."
1,16-Nov-17,2,"Waste of money! This is my first negative review. When I received the candle and opened the lid to the candle it smelled good, but after lighting it and letting it burn for a couple days 2-3 hours preferably each time. The candle has no smell to it at all and I mean at all!!! so I was confused and maybe thought it was my nose or something is wrong. so I asked several people that have come over to smell after I lit it and they said they do not smell it either so I would not waste my money on this sorry but definitely not worth the money!!A $4 dollar candle at Walmart smells better than this"
1,15-Dec-18,5,"Smells like Christmas... I bought this candle to replicate the scent of cedar trees in Washington state, and it captures that for me. (Frankly, before I lived in WA state I thought the scent didn't represent any forests I'd been in, but it really does...). I don't light it, I just uncap and recap it periodically to keep the scent. We don't have this store in my area so it was nice to find it on Amazon. I've also found there's a similar scent in Scentsicles Tree Ornament White Winter Fir Scented Sticks."
1,6-Feb-17,2,"new is not always better??? The scent is nice, but does not throw well.  My main issue with this candle is that it does not burn correctly.  I trimmed the wick before the first burn and every burn since then.  I follow all the tips Yankee Candle suggests, but this candle is burning straight down the center, which basically cuts the candle's life in half.  I just purchased another 'new' scent from Yankee Candle and that one is giving me the same problem.  I think I will stick to my trusted scents as I have never had this issue before.  The Cranberry Chutney candle I bought at the same time as this one is still burning nicely and the scent is wonderful."
1,8-Dec-19,1,Lacking Fragrance short wick. Seconds??? Bought 2 Yankee candles at 14.88 ea. Balsam and Cedar scent.  One candle has good fragrance the other has no fragrance. The wicks were very short which is unusual. the Yankee candle store trims the wick for you. Makes me wonder if these are seconds. Bought 3 of the same candles yesterday at the Yankee candle store on sale!  All perfect!
1,5-Dec-19,5,"Help!! I have been purchasing these candles, three at a time, for over a year.  This time I received a candle that won‚Äôt even light.  This has only happened to me twice but I don‚Äôt know what the steps are to get a credit.  I can‚Äôt return it because I don‚Äôt have the original packaging for it.  I love these candles and have just placed an order for three more. I‚Äôm hoping that somehow I could receive a credit or another candle to replace the one that won‚Äôt light. Thank you in advance for any help you can give me"
1,19-Nov-18,5,"Scent filled the entire house Smells incredible.  I could smell the candle from my upstairs. The scent of cinnamon and apples filled the whole house.  I agree that it is a ""winter"" scent but not necessarily Christmas scent.  Would definitely purchase again."
1,5-Dec-18,1,"BROKEN Love Yankee Candle but arrived shattered, hopefully PIA return process goes smoothly"
1,16-Dec-18,5,"STRONG Scent ! Good Deal ! One of the Best Scents IMO ! Love It ! Makes a Great Gift! This is the Yankee candle we all know and love, the one that makes the whole entire area smell delicious. That amazing smell you get when you walk back into that room or living room with this candlelit smells like cookie heaven.  I would say some people get some duds or knockoff batches and they do not have a scent, but luckily the times I have ordered it was the real deal. Also, I wanted to share the price I paid, $13.99 right before Christmas! I suggest trying to wait for it to be this price but it is usually $19.99 most of the time. Even better deal than the company Yankee Candle offers itself."
1,10-Nov-20,1,"No scent - complete waste of money I bought this candle based on all of the reviews that said how good it smelled. I recently used it twice, leaving it lit  for several hours and we could barely smell any scent in the room at all. VERY disappointing, these should be returnable, especially after paying over $29.00 for it."
1,30-Aug-20,5,"This is my favorite Christmas scent! It's the end of August in So Cal, temps are low 100¬?'s.  The poor candle had been laying on its side and was settled all along the edge.  At first I was upset because I couldn't see the wick to light it! Put it in the garage hoping it would reshape and show me the wick...no luck.  Then I remembered I have a candle burner!  Put it on and let it go! The fragrance was even better than I remembered!  ?üòÅ?üëç"
1,29-Jan-20,4,Luv the scent It arrived with the glass jar broken. It was for myself and not a gift so no biggie. I just broke the rest of the glass off and put it inside a hurricane lamp. Would still buy in the future bc I love the scent and it was a good price.
1,18-Jun-20,5,"Long Lasting I use the candle four or five days a week and leave it burning for five or six hours.  I bought it 2 months ago.  It has a good smell; it reminds me a bit of Christmas. The candle is strong enough to fill the kitchen with smell, but is not as pervasive as I wish, but then again I have never found a candle strong enough in my opinion."
1,9-Nov-18,5,"Red Apple Wreath A great holiday scent!!! If you haven‚Äôt gotten it, get it!!! You will enjoy this scent!"
1,27-Jan-17,2,"I've owned Yankee Candles before and they made my house smell amazing. I bought this one(Christmas Wreath) thinking that it ... I was kind of bummed with this candle. I've owned Yankee Candles before and they made my house smell amazing. I bought this one(Christmas Wreath) thinking that it would make my house smell like a pine tree, but it didn't. There wasn't really any 'smell' at all. The candle itself smells great, but, when lit, it didn't fill the house with the aroma I was looking for."
1,7-Jan-20,5,"Perfect Price when on sale! I purchased this because it was on sale. Normally I will.not pay the price for this brand. That being said, at the price I paid with it on sale I am thrilled with the purchase! I would buy more for this price!"
1,11-Nov-20,5,It‚Äôs beginning to smell a lot like Christmas! Is there ANYTHING better than the smell of a balsam fir Yankee Candle?!?!? I think NOT! If you haven‚Äôt tried these yet I HIGHLY Recommend you do! I swear by them!
1,11-Jan-19,5,Nostelgic Scent and a company with a good reputation for great long lasting scented candles. I was able to catch my favorite Yankee Jar Candle scent at a last minute bargain. Many years ago (more than I can remember) I was given a small Yankee Jar Candle with the Balsom & Cedar scent at a Christmas office party. I have enjoyed this product most every year since!  It brings back childhood memories of the bountiful cedar trees in the country foot hills of my home state of NE Georgia. I hope it stays available for the rest of my lifetime.
1,1-Jan-17,3,"Not much scent when burning I'm a little disappointed. I bought this because we sadly converted from buying real trees to a fake Christmas tree. I hoped this would help bring back some of that holiday smell. The candle smells very nice and like a tree, but it doesn't spread throughout the house much when it's burning. Generally yankee candles have a nice scent when their burning."
1,1-Jan-19,5,"Best smelling candle EVER! Love the warm, comforting scent of this candle! We light one every Christmas Eve to remember our loved ones who have passed....& tell happy, funny stories about them! It brings the younger generations into an interest in genealogy."
1,19-Nov-20,5,"BUY IT!!! You won‚Äôt be sorry! I LOVE THIS CANDLE!!! I am on my second one now and I burn it from the moment I get up till I go to bed! It leaves my house smelling wonderful! I have it near my artificial tree and it gives that little extra Christmas magic!As I said, this is my second one and won‚Äôt be my last. They are worth the money!Also, every yankee candle I have bought off Amazon comes very safely packaged! I 100% recommend!!"
1,20-Nov-19,1,"Eh This candle smells when it‚Äôs cold. However, when it‚Äôs lit I do not smell much. Perhaps these particular ones are old or maybe Yankee candle is just not the best. Will buy bath and body works candles from now on."
1,16-Sep-20,1,Not genuine Yankee Candle This isn‚Äôt the real thing.  It doesn‚Äôt emulate the amazing smell you are expecting if you are a fan of the Balsam and Cedar. We had this same scented candle (bought through the Yankee Candle site last year) in our house and compared this new one and our old one. Hardly a scent from this new one.  Looked at the stickers on the bottom.  Our old one was made in America.  This one was made in Czech Republic...so different.
1,16-Nov-19,3,"My wick came slanted and burns to one side The smell is too sweet, I remember these smelling more like pine and less like perfume.The wick is off center and melting the wax unevenly.  Flame bounces and even with trimming it burns uneven."
1,13-Feb-20,5,"I love Yankee Candles! I was so excited to see a true Yankee Candle for such an affordable price, I just had to buy it! The candle arrived very well packed. The scent is amazing! I burned it throughout the entire holiday season. I used so much that I continued to burn it through January until it was entirely gone. I will definitely buy another one for next holiday."
1,14-Oct-20,5,Smells great I love this candle but I must say in order to really smell it well you should burn two of these.
1,16-Dec-19,1,Not the same candle I bought this on a lightening deal and should have known it was too good to be true.  I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs a knockoff or Yankee Candle has changed but the scent was not strong at all...and the scent itself was like someone was burning garbage
1,23-Dec-18,1,"FAKE? Why is there NO SCENT? Don‚Äôt waste your money. I was ECSTATIC seeing that some of these were only $13. Found my favorite, Christmas cookie...can‚Äôt smell it...AT ALL. I immediately thought it was a fake but the jar sure does look real. Either way, I‚Äôm extremely disappointed"
1,3-May-20,5,Nice Strong Smell I like my candles to have a strong scent and now half my house smells like Cedar which is exactly what I wanted. This is the first time I've personally used a Yankee Candle so I will see how well it holds up. The candle was packed and delivered with care as well.
1,13-Dec-19,5,"Christmas In A Jar! You can‚Äôt go wrong with Yankee Candle and this Balsam & Cedar scent is perfect for Christmastime!Makes you feel like you‚Äôre walking through a pine forest. I burn it all day long, it has a nice throw, but not too strong. Yankee Candle candles last a long time, more so than other popular candles out there. Happy Holidays!"
1,27-Dec-19,5,Great buy Brought as a gift. It smells wonderful. The recipient loved the gift. I had brought the holiday sample pack as well however that turned out to be a waste of money since the candles were unusable and appeared to be of poorer quality so luckily I had brought this and another scent around the same time so I was able to not go empty handed. One of my favorites. Highly recommended.
1,28-Jan-18,5,"Smells like sugar cookies Really enjoy this scent. I was given a medium jar as a gift & purchased the large jar bc I loved it so much. Smells just like fresh baked sugar cookies. Candle burned evenly & has a good throw, it fills the room up nicely."
1,1-Nov-20,1,"Horrible Something wrong with red apple wreath candle!!I got it today, and the red ink was everywhere like blood!!! The box was even wet!!! And where is the smell? This is ridiculous!!"
1,29-Dec-19,5,"We need more than a 5-star method!  They will bet 100 stars! Yankee Candles is definitely right on!  We purchased this candle for ourselves and we loved it so much we gifted this to our loved ones and close friends.  I purchased the smaller candles as well to gift for my Kindergarten school children to take home to their families!  I am now going to purchase a few more for past clients and current business partners!!!!!  Trust me, they will think of you!"
1,6-Dec-19,5,Worth it! Love Yankee candles so much! They never disappoint. This flavor is amazing (Christmas cookie) definitely makes my house smell like freshly baked cookies and it's awesome!!
1,17-Feb-19,3,"not like they used to be I used to love the Yankee candles but something has changed. The wick, even though I trimmed it, smokes terribly and I end up with soot on my windows and pictures in a very short time. This has happened consistemtly with the past 3 candles I bought. No more Yankee candles for me."
1,15-Jun-19,5,I was a bit lonely around the holidays but this candle helped. I wanted my apartment to smell like the holidays because I was feeling pretty sad about a recent breakup. This candle is great for that.
1,9-Jan-20,5,"Smells like my dream home I didn't expect to love this candle, but I got it as a promo during Black Friday while out shopping so I decided to light it first during the holidays. I fell in love, it smelled like my dream home and sweet, but not overpowering. I was so excited to find it on Amazon on sale so I HAD to snatch it up."
1,20-Aug-20,3,"Lasts A Very Long Time But... It is definitely very long lasting, no doubt about that, and Yankee Candle is known for that. But the scent is mediocre. It smells like a phony aerosol air freshener. It's strong, but doesn't smell like any actual cedar or balsam I know of. I wanted this to be good, but I'm afraid it just wasn't."
1,12-Oct-20,1,NO SMELL Have used this for three days.  The room is less than 200 square feet and you can not smell this candle.  At all.  No smell.
1,3-Dec-18,2,Did not smell like Balsam and Cedar Very disappointed with these.  They do not smell in any way like balsam nor cedar when they are burning.  Usually Yankee Candles have the best fragrance.  Wish I had not bought them
1,10-Jun-20,1,"Doesn‚Äôt smell the same as in the store I‚Äôve smelled this candle in the store and loved it. I have only burned mine twice because it smells terrible. Definitely doesn‚Äôt smell like the one in the store. Keeping it with emergency candles if the power goes out, if that tells you anything."
1,30-Oct-19,5,Makes me hungry for cookies I've always loved the Christmas Cookie scent from Yankee candle.  I don't burn most of the candles I buy;  I simply pop the top and leave them out.  One of my favorites.
1,6-Aug-20,5,"Nice scent Someone gave me a Yankee Candles shade for Christmas but I never got around to getting to the store to get a candle. Thank God I found this one!! Now my shade has a nice base. Oh, and the candle smells great of course."
1,31-Dec-19,3,"Average Smells good, but not as strong as I would have thought it would be. Also, surprisingly it's burning fairly quickly...faster than I anticipated. I would say even at a faster rate than Walmart Mainstays brand. I would say it's probably not worth full price, and I'm glad I purchased it at a discount."
1,18-Feb-15,5,"Smells Like Christmas I love the smell of these candles.  The balsam and cedar make the house smell like a fresh, clean morning in the forest.  They also last a long time too.  The one tool that I did purchase for my candles was a wick trimmer.  I thought it might be a frivolous purchase at first, but it only cost $10, so I decided to get it.  Wow - now I can't live without it.  If you trim your candles within 1/8"" each time before you use them, it will burn more evenly and prevent the black smoke that happens when a wick ""blooms"" and isn't trimmed."
1,13-Nov-20,1,Very Weak Scent Not sure if I got a defective Candle but this is one of the weakest Yankee Candle scents I've ever had the displeasure of purchasing.
1,12-Nov-20,5,"My Favorite Candle Scent I love this candle. It lasts forever, it smells like Christmas and it would make a great gift. I have purchased this exact scent at least twice and I have burned them right down to the bottom each time. I highly recommend this product."
1,9-Nov-18,5,"Cherries on Snow My all time favorite holiday candle!!! This is a must for the holidays!!! It fills my home with a great scent! I‚Äôm sad when it burns out! Get this for the holidays, you will love it!!! I get so many compliments and people go out and buy this after visiting my home during the holidays!!"
1,25-Dec-19,3,Low scent So far I‚Äôm not impressed with this candle. Typically YC have been nice and scented/good throw. This one is low scent and it burns like it‚Äôll go out at any minute. Not sure what the problem is but I sent 3 as gifts and I‚Äôm a tad annoyed thinking theirs may be flops too.
1,19-May-20,3,"Santa in a Jar Imagine Santa..after a long night of delivering gifts, eating Taco Bell instead of cookies, drinking prune juice laced with Miralax instead of milk, and then squatting over a glass jar to do his business... add a wick and light it.. and you have this candle.Only, if this is actually how this was created then Santa needs to see a doctor because the color is way too pale for all that.The candle we had prior to this one, which is the exact same, smelled wonderful. Which is the only reason I gave 3 stars."
1,12-Mar-18,5,"""Candlewood""...heh - Nice throw: -- Cold: nice noticeable scent in the immediate vicinity -- Hot: fills the room quickly and will permeate the hallway- Doesn't tunnel when lit long enough (using Onyx holder, topper)- On the bolder musky side for a candle, lighter side for woodsy (like pine trees in the distance rather than standing in a pile of pine needles)Came in handy for today's northeast arctic snowstorm."
1,22-Mar-20,5,"Lasts, smells wonderful My dad LOVES this candle. I have bought him like four over the past couple of years. The candle burns nice and slow, so it lasts a long time. It has a wonderful woodsy scent to it, apparently masculine enough, too (because my dad is that guy!)"
1,18-Oct-20,5,"Recommend arrived perfect, not damaged. I LOVE the pine tree smell, it‚Äôs perfect timing to stock up for the holidays if you‚Äôre a candle lover. The store sells them for $20+, they‚Äôre slightly less through amazon!"
1,9-Nov-18,5,"Christmas Cookie This is a great scent!!! It captures the essences of the holidays! If someone is looking for a holiday candle, this should be their go to candle. I enjoy it and get it every holiday!!"
1,16-Oct-20,5,Smells Yummy! Arrived amazingly quickly. It smells delicious. I had to let all day today and it didn‚Äôt even go down that much. I would purchase it again. I may pick up a few for gifts for the holidays
1,22-Aug-18,5,clean smell of forest. I have burned it twice and it smells delicious and arrived in perfect condition through the mail. A nice large size.
1,23-Apr-19,5,Yankee's are the best; this may have been old. Returned. I think this may have been sitting around for some time. The scent that is usually amazing from Yankee just wasn't here.
1,31-Oct-20,1,"Absolutely no scent. I'm not sure what is going on with theses candles, maybe they are old? Is that why they are discounted?Whatever it is, there is no scent at all. Oh no, maybe I have covid?"
1,3-Feb-20,5,"ONE OF MY FAVORTE COLD WEATHER FAV SCENTS Living in the Pacific Northwest we are blessed to live under the protective balsam-scented branches of Douglas Fir, cedar, pine and other evergreens.  This candle captures that unique scent beautifully filling your home with the magic of a forest."
1,1-Nov-19,5,"great gift, like fall and christmas I got this for my fiancee who LOVES these scents. I'm sensitive to candles, and this one smell great without causing allergy symptoms. Definitely worth it!"
1,7-Nov-19,5,"Smells like forest I love the balsam fir scent - it smells like being outside in the forest at home (I'm from the PNW).This is a very large candle & I find that the glass jar helps it burn evenly - I've burned it for ~10 hrs, and had no problem with a well developing around the wick."
1,29-Nov-19,5,"Scent was great, lasted forever PS: this would make an excellent holiday gift!The only downside is that the candle is so big (length wise) that traditional lighters don't reach the wick after a while. We ended up using hanukkah candles after a while (which are very thin and long)."
1,15-Dec-19,1,Scam Zero scent. I doubt this is even a legit Yankee candle. Doesn‚Äôt smell like anything even when lit. Buyers beware!
1,3-Dec-19,1,Stay away !!! Poor smell. Looks as if this is very old... wax had white molds on it and there was hardly any scent.... will never buy these again !!!
1,13-Feb-20,5,"Love Yankee Candle! Bought this candle along with matching plug ins and other items.  Pricing was fair, delivery was quick, and candle is lasting a long time.  We started using in early December, and now in mid-February, with occasional use since the new year, still going strong, half depleted."
1,17-Feb-19,1,"No scent, don‚Äôt waste your money!! This candle does not seem like a genuine Yankee Candle. The scent was very weak. I will not buy again. Very disappointed."
1,3-Feb-18,5,"A wonderful, winter, Christmas tree, scent. I purchased 3 of these and I will definitely purchase more. This scent reminds me of winter in Michigan, which is where we live. It makes our home smell wonderful. It will make you think of a cozy, winter night, with a snowfall outside. Smells great."
1,10-Nov-20,1,"What happened to Yankee Candles I always remember if you bought a yankee candle you were pretty much guaranteed a candle that smelled amazing.Well this candle does not smell at all, what a waste of money"
1,24-Feb-18,4,"It is a candle Maybe I had higher expectations, but I felt while this candle smells nice initially, I couldn't really smell much after about 5 minutes. I do like fact that cover is glass; I've used other candles that had metal lids which become scolding hot."
1,13-Mar-19,5,"Watch fro the Sales and Buy More than One! The same discounted Yankee Candle selling for about 14$ one week could be regular price the next week....so, you may want to stock up on the discounted or sale candles...Oh, great, long burning and high quality candles."
1,7-Nov-20,5,"Great scent, good quality I'm a little biased when it comes to Yankee Candles, but this scent is really nice and certainly reminds me of the holidays. Can't wait to burn it once December hits!"
1,20-Nov-20,5,Nice scent !! This candles scent is awesome.  I've  never gotten a bad candle from Yankee Candles.
1,16-Jan-16,5,"Wonderful My absolute favorite candle scent of all times. Very hard to find, but well worth the search. It's sweet, but not like a sugar cookie. It's spicy, but not like a cinnamon stick. It's a little like a gingerbread cookie and a tart cherry pie are baking in the oven together. Amazing!"
1,1-Dec-18,1,Packaging for product did not protect it. The candle came broken and not usable. Very disappointed.
1,26-Jan-20,1,Wouldn‚Äôt buy again. Almost no scent.
1,18-Dec-19,5,Nostalgia The pine fragrance sends me right back to childhood and those wonderful Christmas memories. We would go out to find and cut down our own tree. These days we just have an artificial tree but I can still go back in time smelling Yankee Candle‚Äôs Mistletoe.
1,2-Feb-20,3,"Too weakly scented I have always loved yankee candle balsam, fir and other scents that smell like evergreen trees in the winter.  This scent is nice but is very faint when lit.  Try the other evergreen scents .....unless this is for a small bathroom"
1,19-Jan-20,5,"Broken rim :o( I love the scent of the candle, that‚Äôs why I bought it. But when I opened the box, the rim of the glass holding the candle was broken.I‚Äôm not going to be able to use the top cover.The candle is still usable, but it would‚Äôve been nice to be able to use everything I ordered.I won‚Äôt be returning it because I don‚Äôt have the time. I think one more layer of packaging material is necessary."
1,19-Nov-20,1,"Sorry to see that Yankee Candle has literally killed my favorite Balsam Cedar scent - I used to love the wonderful natural tree scent. It used to be that Within 30-60 minutes the powerful fragrance would permeate my room, and I loved it. With the last 5 jars  purchased I returned 2. I'm now  burning the third and it is sad. After 3-4 hours burn there is no noticeable scent. I literally had to bring my nose to the rim of the jar to notice any scent. I think I'm about to give up on them."
1,9-Feb-20,5,Favorite scent! My favorite yankee candle. The only one I even buy honestly. Usually I purchase bath and body works candles because the scent is so potent and the candle life is good but I make an exception around the holidays for this one :)
1,29-Nov-19,1,"Very little scent! I was so disappointed with this candle.  The scent is so light once lit you have to be right on top of the candle to smell it!!!  I have always been able to depend on Yankee Candle before (those bought at Cracker Barrel or at their shop at the mall).  Will NOT purchase another one from Amazon.  You could give as a present, but it wouldn't be appreciated."
1,20-Nov-18,1,Arrived shattered. I heard the shards as soon as I picked up the box.
1,29-Dec-19,2,Arrived Melted Times 3!! I ordered 3 large candles....I was going to gift but glad I opened package.. The candle had melted up into the lid.. I had to carve off 1/4 of the candle to get down to the wick.. I love the scent .. long lasting BUT one big MESS!
1,18-Dec-19,3,"Yankee candles, aren‚Äôt the same anymore, different manufacturer! Not sure if this is supposed to happen when burning a balsam candle, which is green, it turned red, then back to green when it hardens.If this a new feature?The scent doesn‚Äôt smell as strong as it use to.Maybe I got a dud!"
1,30-Jul-19,1,No smell. I have it in my bedroom. Hardly no smell at all. Waste of money. Would never buy again. Super disappointing
1,4-Nov-19,5,"Smells Great This was a gift for my mother-in-law and she said it smelled great, it lasts for a long period of time and burns evenly."
1,11-Apr-18,3,"It's okay, but the scent is very muted unless you are standing right over it The scent is okay and as described; however, unlike other Yankee candles, the scent is so muted that you can barely smell it unless you are standing right over it.  I'm used to burning a Yankee candle and the scent wafting throughout the whole room (and even into other rooms), so this was disappointing.  I would not buy this scent again, but I will still buy Yankee candles.  :)"
1,14-Sep-20,5,"Smells just like Christmas trees Couldn‚Äôt get a real Christmas tree due to wife‚Äôs allergies. This candle made the whole house smell like we had a real one, company couldn‚Äôt tell it was a fake."
1,3-Jan-20,3,Smell isN‚Äôt strong Candle came in tack and well packaged. Smelling the candle before it was lit was a nice vanilla smell but once lit I can‚Äôt smell it. I want my candles to make the room smell nice so when it doesn‚Äôt I just don‚Äôt love them.
1,6-Jun-20,5,Love this smell You know how certain smells immediately send you to your memory palace..? Well this is it for me. Brought me right back to the Maine woods when I was growing up and the smell of the house after picking pine tips to make wreaths.
1,5-May-20,5,Love it Love it smells so good. Got it may4 and it‚Äôs June 10th long lasting forever it‚Äôs like half way full and I‚Äôve lit it every day since then for like 3 hours at a time. Love the smell. Great candle
1,28-Dec-18,5,"Never disappoint, great candles! I love Yankee candles! I bought these two candles for my daughter-in-law for Christmas. She loves both the scents, she is also a fan of everything Yankee. I love the unbeatable price of these through Amazon."
1,15-Oct-20,5,Sweet Apple Cinnamon Yankee candle Nice pleasant smell. Came very well packaged- no fear of it breaking on transit. Way better because mostly a stronger scent than the home sweet home.
1,15-Aug-20,5,Strong scent and 2 wicks Most candles have a weak scent.  Yankee Candles quickly fill more than one room with the scent.  The 2 wick candles are especially good.  They are worth the price.
1,26-Oct-20,5,"Sugar Cookie Smells Wonderful I have had some Yankee's as of recent that were lacking in fragrance so I was worried about this one, but it is fabulous! Very please with my purchase. My home smells like fresh baked cookies all the time now."
1,22-Jul-20,5,love it and was great price love it and was great price got 2 should've got more was on sale. use it every night after dinner to get rid of cooking scents. great value for $ and lasts long time
1,23-Dec-19,1,"No smell! This candle did not have much scent. After trimming wicks and burning all the way across for several hours, it only smelled like warm wax. I notified Amazon and received a replacement. The replacement was the same. Would have been a great deal but only if it had of smelled like it was supposed to."
1,4-Jan-19,5,"A WINNER This candle was a Christmas gift for a friend.  I personally feel that you can't go wrong with Yankee Candles - especially if the recipient is a ""candle person"", which my friend is!!  She was very happy with her candle - and I am happy knowing that she liked it - and with AMAZON you always get ""a bang for your buck""!!  Happy New Year - AMAZON !!!"
1,15-Jan-20,5,Great gift! Was purchased as a gift. They were very happy with the scent and also noted that the label is easy to peel off in case you don‚Äôt want to keep that on. Burn life has been really good so far. Scent fills the room.
1,11-Feb-19,4,"Got for a great price! I love testing out Yankee Candles when they go on a good discount on Amazon. This one has a very clean/fresh winter scent. Sometimes I feel like certain Yankee Candles are weaker than others and this wasn't one of the strongest ones I've tried, but it was still nice and worth it for the price!"
1,30-Apr-20,5,"Brings back memories This is my all time favorite scent... period. When I light it in the winter it brings me the best childhood memories of Christmas with my family, which I no longer get to enjoy. But the memories and the smell are all there still!"
1,13-Dec-19,3,Not sure if these are authentic I bought a handful if these since it‚Äôs my favorite holiday scent. They smell authentic but they are not the same quality. The wax melts weird and pools up at the bottom if the candle and doesn‚Äôt re harden like normal
1,25-Jun-20,1,Had to send it back I lit it up for about 5 minutes and it smelled like vanilla plastic. It DID NOT smell like sugar cookies. It was nauseating smell. It was awful. Made me nauseous. Yuck
1,9-Dec-19,5,Hard to find this pine Works great
1,8-Nov-19,5,"Awesome all the way around! Excellent packaging and great scent. The price is the best part, love it!!! Will order again and again."
1,26-Dec-19,5,"Best seasonal candle! I was hesitant to order this candle; the replacement I was searching for wasn't available, &this showed up in my search. I'm genuinely thrilled with this purchase!! The price is terrifically affordable, the scent is incredibly authentic& potent, and it seems to be lasting well, though I've burned it for hours each night since it arrived! Love this candle, & am ordering another for 2020!"
1,5-Oct-20,5,Christmas candle.  Must have Make your home smell like the Holliday sprit with this Christmas tree candle . You can deck the halls all year long . So pick one up today
1,26-Nov-17,1,"No scent I'm so disappointed with this candle.  I've had it lit for hours and I can barely smell anything.  Yankee Candles used to be great, but this is the last one I'll be buying."
1,12-Dec-17,3,Like others I found this candle lacking in scentpower Like others I found this candle lacking in scentpower.  It‚Äôs a pleasant smell but lighter than I was hoping for and it seems to come and go.  It took several hours for the first real whiff.....subsequent burnings have been inconsistent as if the scent oils are not evenly dispersed throughout the wax.
1,28-Nov-19,5,Wonderful scent and great price Packaged perfectly and would have taken a tornado to damage it. Wonderful scent that goes splendidly in our log home. It's like a touch of the outdoors in your home. Not to strong and not to weak...just right. Incredible price for a Yankee Candle.If anyone doesn't think the smell or price isn't great then they can't be pleased no matter what.
1,27-Dec-19,3,"Stopped having scent after 3rd burn The first 3 times I burned this is smelled FANTASTIC! Great holiday scent. But after that, it did not have a noticeable pine scent for the remainder of the candle. I don‚Äôt know if I just got a bum one or if Yankee quality hasn‚Äôt decreased since the last time I got one (which has been years).  I still just like to have candles burning for the ambiance so I used it till it was gone,  but was disappointed by the lack of scent."
1,11-May-20,5,GREAT PRICE..when I ordered ! My favorite scent !! I ordered 3 because the price was amazing !! These Yankee Candles always fluctuate in price..but you usually have the best prices here on Amazon. Thank you !!
1,9-Dec-19,5,Smells like Christmas. Smells so good! Great buy if you have an artificial tree but want that Christmasy smell.
1,13-Sep-20,4,"Nice scent, damaged lid I like the scent. It's piney and gives me that winter feel. The scent is not as Christmasy as I had anticipated, however. Nice candle nonetheless. The lid to my candle arrived cracked. It doesn't affect the function and scent of the candle, but it should be noted that this implies a possibility of receiving a broken candle jar."
1,4-Mar-19,5,Nearly year round scent This scent is great for all of fall and winter. Even early spring when stubborn snow sticks around. This has a great throw and scent is just amazing. Not just apples but light cinnamon and clove with a twist of something citrusy. A great holiday scent that says ENJOY!
1,3-Feb-19,2,Disappointed with light scent Balsam and Pine has always been my favorite scent for winter.  I have purchased many candles direct from Yankee.  This was my first yankee candle purchase from amazon.  The price was very good but the scent was not strong at all.  Very disappointing.  Will not order yankee from amazon again.
1,20-Dec-19,5,A big candle! I like that this is double-wicked. This will last a while so it's a good value. Just make sure you keep the wicks clipped to avoid the large flame and uneven burning. Semi-strong scent. Great as a gift!
1,16-Nov-19,1,"Complete disappointment no wicks The candle didn't have wicks, so I had to put on candle warmer. A complete disappoint"
1,26-Dec-19,5,Favorite fragrance of all We prefer Yankee candles and purchase this scent every year.  The price on it was good and therefore got it through Amazon.  Can't go wrong with Yankee and this scent is by far our favorite.
1,11-Jan-20,5,"Makes a great gift The jar size was good and the scent was very nice. The recipient loved it. Just beware of what scent you choose, in this case I had done a previous look at what they liked. Many people don't like things like pumpkin scent."
1,24-Apr-20,1,It was old and had zero scent It was old and had zero scent.
1,14-Mar-20,5,Awesome scent! The scent was great especially with the tree that was in the living room. I have it a star less because it didn't last as long as I had expected it to. One month was too short for me.
1,6-Nov-18,5,"Reminds me of growing up Bayberry candles were a part of growing up. Mom frequently burned them during the holiday months. Decades later finally got my own. The Yankee candle is just like home, mom‚Äôs and now mine."
1,9-Jan-20,3,"Not as strong compared to other Yankee candles. I'm disappointed!  Poor quality. I wanted to fill the living room with a scent of pine for xmas. It failed to deliver. The worst Yankee candle I've ever purchased. It burns long, but had very little scent when burning."
1,15-Dec-17,1,"No Smell Coming Off This Candle Always love Yankee Candles however this one was disappointing. Would not recommend as there is little to no pine scent coming off this candle. You have to put your nose right above candle to get any sort of scent. The first year with an artificial tree and was trying to get a pine tree smell throughout the house, unfortunately not happening with this candle. Will have to go with another scent. :("
1,14-Mar-20,5,"Classic Christmas This is my favorite scent from yankee, and is way above the other Christmas scents from other brands.  This scent is clean and simple, and reminds me of my aunts house when I was a kid and she had a real tree every year and the scent filled the house for the holidays."
1,17-Dec-19,5,"Fantastic smell that fills the house! Scent is exactly as described. This is great size, I can leave it for hours and it barely shrinks, one this size usually last me few months, lighting it probably once week leaving it burning for few hours."
1,4-Nov-19,5,nice smell was on sale half price when i got two of them and smell great like the outdoors
1,4-Dec-19,1,"Gets an F! I should have listened to the reviews. This candle is an F. I‚Äôm a teacher and I know an F when I see one. There is absolutely no scent. I asked my daughter if she smelled anything and she said she smells ‚Äúburnt.‚Äù Only reason it gets 1 star is because that‚Äôs the lowest I could give and it does burn, so at least that‚Äôs something."
1,12-Nov-20,2,Disappointing I am very disappointed especially for the price of these candles that you couldn‚Äôt smell the scent at all
1,6-Jan-20,5,LOVE This is one of my favorite scents from Yankee Candle. It smells like you just baked cookies in the oven. Delivered nicely and un-damaged. I have this in my kitchen and I'll burn it after cooking.
1,22-Feb-20,5,Christmas in a jar My favorite cheap candle from Yankee candle. I have bought probably about 10 of them in the last couple years. They last a long time and smell like Christmas trees.
1,2-Dec-19,3,"Too light of a scent Got this in Christmas Cookie. I can't remember a Yankee Candle with such a weak scent. Disappointed. Guess I will order from Goose Creek from now on, the scents are unbelievablely good."
1,6-Oct-19,5,loved the smell loved the smell its perfect specially if your bathroom stink cause of your room mate
1,13-Nov-19,5,Nice Candle Burning it now.  The scent is spot on - not too much and not too little. This is definitely on my buy again list.
1,15-Jan-20,5,Best candles! Don't bother with cheaper ones! I used to buy cheap candles for years. Not anymore! Yankee are the best! They burn evenly and always smell beautiful without being overpowering! I gift them all the time too!
1,24-Dec-19,1,"Wonderful scent Ordered this and it came broken. In several years, this is only the 2nd item I sent back. A new one came as peomised-I didn‚Äôt even open the Jod, I could here it was broken again.."
1,23-Nov-20,5,"Christmas Tree Sniffing Smells exactly like a Christmas tree! Not as overpowering as the Balsam and Cedar scent that I also bought, I like the Mistletoe better. Reminds me of Christmas, love it."
1,3-Feb-20,4,Where's the smell!?? Not as scented as the last ones I bought.lucky if you could smell it in a single room.I used to love the way they filled the house.now these are the same a cheaper candles.
1,8-Aug-20,5,VERY NICE! I just lit my Yankee candle for the first time today. What a pleasant fragrance!  It's the best yet.  I will order again.
1,30-Aug-20,5,"Lotta bang, and scent for your buck!!  ?üëç?üòÄ This is a favorite of mine.  I have noticed this candle is a different wax than the other jars with glass tops/lids.  It makes the scent more pronounced and I love it!!  Best price I have found too!"
1,19-Jul-20,4,"High CP value, full of warm taste, good durability Here I want to show that the durability of this product is quite good, and it will not be difficult to last for some fragrances of the same brand. Recommend to everyone, full of warm taste, but also make the nerve soothing and relaxing a lot!"
1,11-Dec-19,5,My favorite scent! I love this candle! Christmas cookie is my favorite scent and I use it year round.
1,19-Jan-20,5,"Best Christmas Yankee candle! Another great Yankee Candle!Filled my house with Christmas scents the whole season.  Only burned halfway down, so I packed and sealed it well and will burn it again next year!"
1,9-Jan-20,5,"Smells fantastic I love the scent of this one. It doesn‚Äôt have that super fake apple cinnamon scent cheaper brands do, and no one scent overpowers the others. A lovely fall/winter blend."
1,29-Dec-18,5,Very Nice Ver nice xmas smell it has a little pine smell which I like because I don't like the pine tree smell really. It's a clean light pine sweet smell def recommend
1,10-Nov-20,5,"Great scent! This candle is best for winter months, but it smells really nice and is not too strong or too subtle"
1,7-Mar-20,5,"Great candle! Great smelling candle that burns all of the way down.for from a gift, winter and fall. I love pine though and can use it all year round. Thank you!"
1,26-Jan-19,5,"Smells terrific Smells like fall or winter, pie and happiness to me.  Nice size, very strong scent, I  can just leave the lid off and my kitchen smells like it."
1,8-Oct-20,5,Very good strong scented candle! The sent of this candle is very strong. from the moment I lit it the sent went throughout my entire house. It‚Äôs been lit for 7 hours and it‚Äôs barely lost any wax and the flame never gave out. If you order the large tumbler You will be surprised at how massive this candle is. It‚Äôs a perfect gift and it really truly does smell like a Christmas tree. I‚Äôm now a Yankee man for life.
1,3-Dec-19,2,"Scent not strong I've burned about half of this candle, but unfortunately it's scent isn't very strong compared to other scented candles. I suggest looking further if you prefer more than just a hint of scent."
1,6-Feb-20,3,"No scent. I remember Yankee Candles having amazing scents. - this one basically smells like a regular candle. (Almost no scent). Wasn‚Äôt expensive, but not impressed with the scent. Maybe this one was bad?"
1,4-Oct-19,1,Wrong candle was packaged I ordered my favorite yankee candle holiday scent balsam and cedar but unfortunately when I opened the box I found patchouli which has never been a smell I liked. I guess I‚Äôll gift it to someone
1,10-Dec-19,5,Yankee candle always delivers I read that some people had problems with the candle not smelling strong enough or burning too quickly. For me personally I have no issues what so ever. I bought two of these two replace my old balsam and cedar that has finally burned down to nothing. So far it appears to burn at the same rate as the old one and smells just as strong if not stronger!
1,1-Aug-20,5,Smells like a pine forest when you can‚Äôt go outside. I Love Yankee candles their scents come as close as the real things they are copying and they last four hours.
1,11-Mar-20,1,Dont waste your money on this. What a disappointment.  This brand is terrible in my opinion . It doesnt burn evenly and the scent is very faint. My new fav is Village candles.
1,26-Nov-18,5,Christmas tree This is my go to for when I put up my Christmas tree.  Makes the house smell like a fresh cut tree.  It also mixes well if you have a cinnamon candle lit also.
1,24-Jan-20,5,My favorite candle. Love the scent. Not overpowering or sweet. Candle lasts well compared to others of similar size. Like it better than candles specifically to eliminate pet odors.
1,8-Dec-18,5,"Gift This is a Christmas gift for someone that LOVES Yankee Candles.  They cost more, but she thinks they are worth it.  I am just happy to be able to give her something I know she will enjoy!  Personally, I would be hungry all the time smelling this. :)"
1,11-Oct-20,1,Barely a scent So disappointed. Burned for hours and could barely smell the scent. Waste of money. Back to Bath and Body candles.
1,21-Jan-20,4,Burns even I love how the aax burns nice and even.quite possibly cuz the double wick.smells good .scent only lingers a little bit tho and that's only a quick whiff of it
1,2-May-20,1,DONT DO IT No. Just no. I read the reviews and took a chance anyway...they were right. Upon arrival it looked like the candle has melted at some point and came back together. Barely any scent at all. The previous candle I had like this from the store. Filled up the entire room with its aroma in mins. I left this burning for well hour 2 hours barely a scent. Burns quickly and the color is weird after a few uses.
1,20-Dec-19,5,Christmas cookies I had seen so many negative reviews on yankee candles.  I recently purchased one and it came perfectly boxed inside box. The smell is terrific. I ordered another one. I dont understand all the negative things.  My experience was great .
1,4-Mar-19,5,Dead ringer for fresh mistletoe Dead ringer for fresh mistletoe  Fresh and piney scent that adds a festive overture to my home. Great on snowy days in January and February as well. A must have scent for candle collectors who like candles with a string throw
1,31-Aug-17,3,Skimpy on the scent The scent in this Yankee Candle balsam candle is mediocre -- not strong and now that it is burned down about an inch even less so.  I am surprised as I thought this was one of the better brands.  Maybe in the shorter containers ... maybe with 3 wicks ... would be better?
1,30-Oct-16,5,"This candle made my whole home smell like a freshly cut spruce Christmas tree This candle made my whole home smell like a freshly cut spruce Christmas tree. It was completely delightful. Just make sure to trim the wick regularly to avoid soot, like any candle. I usually burn one for a minimum of 3 hours at a time."
1,28-Jan-20,5,Love it! I bought several of these for Christmas gifts and for myself. You can‚Äôt go wrong with Yankee Candles and this scent is good for both men and women!
1,14-Dec-19,5,"The smell is amazing like baking cookies The smell is amazing. However the burn life is terrible. I have had many Yankee Candles and they last a really long time. Unfortunately this candle did not even last 50 hours. Im still buying another one, because I really like the cookie smell, and the candle has an extremely low in price."
1,8-Aug-20,1,"No scent I have been buying Yankee candles for years, but I feel that this one is defective!  It has very, very little scent. I usually can smell a candle as soon as I walk into the room, but I have left it lit for an hour at a time, and you can't even tell that it's burning. No aroma, whatsoever.I would like a replacement, as I believe when this one was manufactured, it had a bad batch!"
1,4-Jan-20,5,Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle Balsam & Cedar Perfect for Christmas Holiday season and the scent is lovely.  I had had this in years past so I was delighted to obtain the candle again for this year.
1,31-Oct-20,5,"Smells like Christmas. I do like tge fragrance,  however I would like it be stronger. Its very light."
1,11-Dec-18,5,"Great holiday gift My son said he needed something to put in his room while he was playing video games because he farts a lot and his mom yells at him when she walks in. His favorite scent is balsam fir so, low and behold the Yankee Balsam Fir fart linger eliminator. Great item, great buy."
1,20-Nov-20,5,Candles are great. Love the scent of this candle. One of my favorites. Thank you. Nicole Rispoli
1,12-Jun-20,5,Love love ?üíò yankee candles What can i say its a yankee candle. Always great scents and sizes. Prices are a bit high but I'll still buy them
1,25-Jun-20,3,"cant use the whole candle now got halfway through the candle and then i heard a pop and the glass jar the candle is on cracked all the way down the side... i blew it out and let it cool off, and relit the candle a few days later and 10 min in it popped again and the cracks got bigger. I'm not going to risk injury for a candle."
1,17-Nov-18,5,Smells like Christmas I was a little hesitant to buy because you really never know with candles. It smells like a Christmas Tree. Haven't burned it yet though. Husband likes to wait until after Thanksgiving to do anything Christmasy
1,10-Aug-20,5,"Smells piney It didn't say pine but it smelled pretty piney to me, which is good because that's what I wanted."
1,18-Jul-20,5,Beautiful forest scent Love Yankee Candle anyway but like the two wick over one wick. Two wicks burn the candle more evenly.
1,28-Sep-19,5,Love this! Great gift idea. Great scent. Long lasting. Clean burning.
1,21-Apr-20,5,My favorite YC scent! I ordered this back in November and currently (4/21) still burn it with a little less than half left! I burn maybe twice a week from 2-4 hours. You can't beat the longevity of Yankee Candles.
1,17-Aug-20,5,"Classic Yankee Candles Well packaged, beautiful scent, long burning candle!  You can‚Äôt beat Yankee Candle‚Äôs quality"
1,12-Feb-19,2,Didn‚Äôt throw scent Was disappointed that this large candle didn‚Äôt throw more scent. Pine scented candles are my favorite and I burn them daily around the holidays. I won‚Äôt be purchasing again. I‚Äôll go back to Village Candle for my pine scents.
1,11-Jul-20,1,No scent Very disappointed for this being a Yankee candle. Usually this brand is rich I‚Äôm smell but this candle has no scent.
1,16-Dec-19,5,Satisfied Arrived quickly. Smells awesome
1,9-Dec-19,3,Buy new from store Candle lacks scent. Must be old.
1,22-Dec-19,1,"No scent at all I love Yankee Candles all year round. I was excited to purchase this candle for $15 but am sadly disappointed. Therw is zero scent to it. I don't know if this is last years batch or what but i have never had a Yankee not smell, like at all. Oh well it's a leson learned that i won't buy candles from Amazon again."
1,7-Jan-20,5,Great Yankee candles never disappoint.... great scent and was an awesome price at the time I purchased it.  I gave 2 as gift and received one as a gift!!!
1,16-Oct-18,1,Bad The whick was low and it hardly smelled do not buy candles online
1,4-Dec-18,2,"No smell but perfect condition I burn Yankee candles in my house all day long.  This one came yesterday, I burned it for 8 hours & there was absolutely NO fragrance.  I will be ordering another flavor.  Hopefully these are true Yankee Candles they are sending us."
1,5-Jan-20,5,Long lasting scent Burned this for hours and it's still full and the scent is long-lasting. The candle itself lasts way longer than bath and body works. Well worth the discounted price and full price.
1,29-Sep-19,5,Great scent and very nice for holidays. This was overall great and great packing.  Love it.
1,26-Jan-20,5,Great scent It came broken. The glass was broken at the top.I kept it. Didn‚Äôt return because I live in rural Alaska and needed it right away.
1,25-Dec-19,5,Repurchase another candle on amazon.com. I used to be a great quality product that has lost its integrity and sent will not repurchase again I went with another product on amazon.com
1,21-Nov-20,1,"Scented candle with no scent Smells nice when your nose is in the jar, but no smell in the area"
1,1-Jan-17,5,"My mom used to burn one of these every day that the tree was up and it made it feel like we had a live tree in the house My parents for years have had artificial trees. My mom used to burn one of these every day that the tree was up and it made it feel like we had a live tree in the house. I have recently purchased one for my house.Admittedly, higher ceilings and larger rooms, one candle doesn't seem to really be enough, but its still the ""smell of the season"" for me."
1,5-Feb-20,5,Great for holidays The mistletoe scent is my favorite Christmas candle. I put up a fake tree every year and this smells the closest to the real thing.
1,25-Jun-19,5,"Love A definite favorite of mine, always arrives in perfect condition. Lasts weeks for us!"
1,26-Dec-17,4,"Christmas in a jar I posted this picture on my Facebook and said ""mistletoe is always better than camel toe""  This scent is a real Christmas tree in a jar! l ?üíô it!"
1,10-Oct-20,4,Not as strong as I hoped for I had another candle I bought in town last year about this same time (I live in a small town in the mountains.) It is still in the closet after burning it. I can still smell it. This one is about half that strength. I can't talk about how long it lasts yet. It was packaged well and arrived quickly.
1,13-Sep-19,5,Christmas cookies I use this candle in my kitchen. The only problem is by it having a cookie scent it makes me hungry.
1,18-Jan-20,5,Decent Candle This is a good candle but it burns a lot of wax. The scent is good also. It‚Äôs worth the expense but a little faster to burn out of wax.
1,20-Dec-19,5,Buy it~you‚Äôll absolutely love it! This is by far the BEST CHRISTMAS smell ever. It far surpasses any other scent of Christmas. I get compliments ever time our door is opened and the smell emits all through the house! It‚Äôs definitely a must have!
1,4-Aug-19,5,"Excellent candle Love this candle, the scent isn‚Äôt overpowering and smells great."
1,14-Nov-20,1,"High priced candles with no scent Not sure if it was a sale product from amazon or yankee itself, the candle I got didn‚Äôt had scent at all even after 2 days of burning. Even a $1 candle brought from dollar tree have scent, but this doesn‚Äôt. Using it as high priced candle to light up fireworks."
1,9-Nov-20,5,"Smells amazing Smells amazing, great holiday gift. Packaged well to avoid damage."
1,1-Mar-19,5,"These smell wonderful! Christmas Cookie smells absolutely wonderful any time of year, makes me feel like company is coming, even if they are not!  If company is coming, it makes a wonderful welcoming smell!  These were a discounted price, but the quality was not discounted at all!"
1,28-Nov-19,1,"Very little scent I have used Yankee Candles for years.  I have not bought one for quite a while until recently.  I had read somewhere that the scents aren't as strong now as they were previously.  I thought ""that can't be"" but it is true.  When I burn it (Balsam & Cedar) & someone comes into the room they don't notice it & I don't either.  I am very disappointed.  I WILL NOT buy another Yankee Candle."
1,5-Nov-19,5,Smells great Smells lovely and is long lasting
1,28-Jan-18,5,The smell is perfefct for winter. Had it since November and it's still 3/4 left! Great size for the prize and fragrances rooms fast. We have a studio and it feels up the whole place quite quickly.
1,15-Jun-20,4,"strong scent strong scent to a point u was getting a headache. I guess you want the strong scent, go for it."
1,13-Jan-19,2,Burns weird Usually I love table candles but these burn weird. Two sides remain high and the other sinks... it‚Äôs like the wicks were placed incorrectly. As I say I love yankee so maybe I‚Äôll stick to the one wicks from now on.
1,31-Dec-19,1,No scent It seems like it will last along time.  But it looks like it was stored at the wrong temperature before shipment and I can‚Äôt smell it.
1,28-Dec-19,5,Smells amazing I bought this when it was on sale.  And I have lit it every night since then ! It smells amazing and just couldn‚Äôt beat the price !
1,17-Nov-20,5,Smells nice but not the best throw. Just got this in the mail a couple hours ago. It does smell nice and I love this packaging. It doesn‚Äôt have as much of a throw as I would like. I started it after dinner and the smell of my meal lingers longer and stronger than the candle.
1,13-Jan-20,5,Smells amazing Bought as a gift. Came wrapped very well and didn't break during shipment.  Smells great! Also great price for the large candle
1,17-Dec-19,5,"Perfect scent Yankee, though. Expensive. Is amazingly on point with their scents. This one is perfect for the Christmas season. Heavenly. But not over powering."
1,5-Feb-20,4,Good scent but not strong Burns quickly and doesnt have a very strong smell. The scent is pleasant but I would like it to be more concentrated when it is burning. I seem to burn it for hours before it really fills up a room.
1,28-Dec-19,5,"Most buy! Came packaged very well to make sure it stayed safe during shipping and the scent was amazing! Everyone thought I was baking cookies, and it had burnt for a long time."
1,6-Dec-18,5,Very nice odor Very nice odor which is much better than the new style Elevation Collection. Much better price as well. Will not burn to bottom of tumble and leaves about a 1/2 inch of wax unused as wick does not reach down far enough.
1,22-Feb-20,5,"Will continue to buy til the end of time! This candle is like Christmas in a jar! The perfect scent to have burning all winter long. It's VERY strong and can easily fill up my 1,050 sqft townhome. My only criticism is that, it didn't seem to last the 110-150 burn hours it should have. I'd burn it for a few hours a day throughout the month of December, and it was down to almost nothing by mid January. Maybe that's normal, but I would have expected it to last longer."
1,18-Jan-20,1,Zero fragrance before lighting and after There is zero fragrance from the wax before lighting and after lighting the candle. I am returning. I was very disappointed.
1,16-Jun-20,1,"Buy a different brand. I used to praise Yankee Candles.  They must be skimping on their oil scents, because I am totally disappointed.  I can burn this candle for an hour and leave my apartment,  come back in, and I can't smell anything."
1,22-Feb-16,3,"The scent seemed to have faded so when I burned ... The scent seemed to have faded so when I burned it ,you could barely smell it.  I have had this same candle in the past and it would fill the room with a fresh green tree scent for the holidays......this one, you would have to be standing right over top of it to catch the scent.  May have been this particular candle, so I gave it 3 stars."
1,24-May-20,3,"Doesn't smell like evergreen Quality is fine; I just don't like the scent.  It's too sweet.  Smells more like an old lady's potpourri drawer than a pine forest.  If you want that, spend the extra money and get the Thymes frasier fir candle."
1,13-Dec-18,5,My favorite scent by Yankee Remember coming home from school and your mom was baking cookies?  Me neither!  But this smells just like that would.  :D
1,23-May-20,5,Amazing candle! Love the two wick candle.  The candle burned evenly and scent can be smelled throughout my house.
1,31-Dec-19,5,Nice scent. Purchased for my friend as she said it was her favorite. She loves the scent. As for my I will treat myself with one later on.
1,3-Jan-20,5,Buy two! Smells great! Ordered this to add a seasonal fragrance to my home. Everyone who walked in commented positively on the scent. Highly recommended.
1,29-Dec-19,5,Great Fragrance The scent is wonderful....vanilla and sugar cookies.  The two wicks make the candles burn evenly.  They last a very long time.
1,22-Jan-20,5,Covers odors well Great value.  Lasts a looooooooooong time and I love the fragrance.  I keep one on hand always for my husband's tv room.
1,12-Nov-19,3,"Catch it on sale Smelled really good the first day. I cant seem to smell it anymore. Ive asked guest just incase ive become nose blind, but they cant either."
1,3-May-20,5,Clean and outdoorsy You will love the smell when you light one of these candles.  The aroma fills the whole house!!
1,18-Nov-20,5,"Yankee Candles Don't Disappoint Smells like Christmas! I love it. Would be a great gift! Beautiful on my mantle. Arrived on time, well packaged."
1,14-Jan-20,3,Just okay. I usually buy White Barn 3-wick candles from Bath and Body but missed out on the Spruce candle.  I wouldn't buy this one again....it's just okay.
1,21-Dec-19,2,"Balsam? I'm not sure what scent it is, but it doesn't smell like balsam to me.  Nice jar, decent candle, but disappointed in the scent."
1,9-Mar-20,5,Awesome sweet scent Great scent!!! Have been using since Xmas and it has not lost any of the scents strength. Highly recommend
1,29-Nov-19,5,Love this candle! Loveeee this scent! And so much cheaper than the yankee candle store! The first one came all smashed and they sent me out a new one ASAP! Love it! Thank you!
1,30-Dec-19,5,Yankee Candles make Great Gifts! These were all gifts that were greatly appreciated. With Yankee candles every scent seems to be long lasting and fragrant.
1,21-Apr-20,5,Love it! Smells so good Smells soooo good and lasts long. Been using it since December and we are only just now getting to the end of it. We light it often. 10/10!
1,15-Dec-19,5,Giftable. Lasts a long time Very long lasting and the scent is nice but I wish it was a little stronger and I never thought I‚Äôd say this of this brand.
1,2-Jun-20,5,"Love the scent! Never ordered a Yankee Candle from Amazon before, was afraid it might come shattered. Surprisingly though, came well packaged and without a single scratch. Will definitely order another soon!"
1,23-May-20,5,DISAPPOINTED ?üòû Love Yankee candles ?üïØ I ordered 3 of these absolutely NO SMELL AT ALL!!!! Old candle.
1,10-Jun-20,4,nice smell liked this candle - burned long and bright and filled the place with a nice sent.
1,3-Jun-20,1,"AWFUL CANDLE! BLACK SOOT ON EVERYTHING,BARELY HAS A SCENT. WILL NEVER BUY AGAIN,STICK WITH TRAPP!"
1,7-Dec-18,1,"Candles No Longer Fill Room With Smell We had this same exact scented candle from a few years ago. It finally ran out, so we replaced it with the same exact scent from Yankee Candle. Unfortunately, the new candle doesn't fill the room with a smell like the old candles did. You have to smell directly over the flame to get any whiff of the scent at all. Sad."
1,4-Mar-20,5,Obsessed I love this candle. I am still using it in March even though it's a Christmas scent because it is so yummy!
1,17-Jan-20,5,Odor of pine The odor of pine was great. We used it every day for two weeks during the Holidays and the smell was wonderful!!
1,23-Nov-20,5,Balsam and Fir Love this scent! Can‚Äôt find it in any Yankee candle store right now with Christmas coming up. I was able to find it on here & for only like $14!!!!
1,10-Mar-20,5,Great buy! I love this candle! It smells great for winter and lasts me a long time. I will definitely continue to buy this!
1,15-Nov-19,5,Arrived as promised and just as described Arrived as promised and just as described
1,8-Feb-20,5,Great smell Great smell and long lasting.  I use it in a 10 by 10 room and fill up with the scent in about ten minutes.
1,14-Aug-20,5,Delicious smell! I absolutely love this candle . It actually smell when burning unlike many other scented candles I‚Äôve bought. Worth the purchase
1,7-Jan-20,3,"Don‚Äôt smell like they used to! These aren‚Äôt cheap!  I had hoped it had more scent!  They used to, but no more.  More expensive and less scent!"
1,27-Jul-20,3,Rec'd damaged but great scent when fixed!. Fyi for vendor: pkg stored on its side caused candle to melt on side of jar. I was able to trim down to the wick and use the candle.
1,2-Jan-20,5,Long lasting scent This is my favorite yankee candle scent! Unfortunately they don‚Äôt make it anymore. Luckily I found it on Amazon.
1,13-Jan-20,5,"Fantastic, long lasting scent The product is as described.  Fantastic, clean scent; not overpowering.  Scent is long lasting after the candle is extinguished."
1,7-Jan-20,5,"Lingering Scent I absolutely liked how the scent lingers throughout the whole house, even upstairs while I burn it down stairs.?üòÄ"
1,9-Nov-20,5,Great deal Great price for this candles. It smells amazing!!!
1,29-Dec-19,5,The ultimate Christmas sent. It just isn‚Äôt Christmas without the scent of this candle in my living room.
1,17-Oct-20,1,DO NOT BUY...BUYER BEWARE Horrible burnt for 2 hours no scent none nothing
1,29-Dec-19,5,"Perfect Christmas and winter months scent This brings to mind Christmas time with the strong smell of pine tree.  My favorite scent for winter months.Sad, that I had ordered two - but  I heard delivery person drop the box and glass broke.  On checking, one indeed had a chip on glass lid.I should have said something as she was walking away; but at the time I was hopeful items were ok.  Fortunately, only one was broken and Amazon will replace."
1,28-Dec-19,5,"Yankee candle is the greatest smelling quality candle out there I love Yankee candles they are worth the price for longevity and scent, this prod. shipped fast and was VERY well packaged"
1,1-Dec-19,1,"No scent I bought 4 candles because they were the special of the day. I have burned 2 out of 4 and you CANNOT smell the scent. I think they were old candles and that is why they were on sale, I am So very disappointed!! I love a great smelling candle but will never buy yankee candle again."
1,11-Sep-20,5,"Great candle, scent is not overpowering Very nice candle. The scent is subtle but very pleasant. It came in perfect condition and has been burning well. I really like it! My room smells faintly of a pine tree farm now and it is lovely."
1,3-Sep-20,5,"Just as described Just as described, arrived quickly. Packaged safely!"
1,23-Oct-19,5,Smells amazing packaged great Perfection amazing scent my absolute favorite ever!!!
1,13-Jan-20,5,"Wonderfully scented I always look for this around the holidays but now I'm just hooked on the scent all year round. It seems to last forever and it's scent isn't heavy, just heavenly!"
1,17-Oct-20,3,Scent is too faint. Scent is too faint. Lasts about 50 hours.
1,25-Jan-20,5,It smells divine I love the scent of this candle. It burns clean and lasts all through the Christmas season and beyond.
1,27-Jun-19,5,Great price for my favorite scent Great price. Love the scent.  Would buy again.
1,16-Sep-20,1,Melted upon arrival They continue to always come melted and I can't find the wick
1,29-Oct-20,5,Smells good and makes a great gift. Makes excellent gifts for friends and neighbors. Always well received. Burning time is good and the scent is good as well.
1,14-Sep-19,5,Candle Love this all the time
1,7-Jun-20,5,Broken It arrived broken on top but I love the scent and am tired of returns
1,4-Nov-20,5,Awesome scent I love the balsam and cedar scent
1,7-Dec-18,2,"No smell... so disappointing. I‚Äôm a big Yankee Candle user and I buy Balsam and Cedar candles every year directly from Yankee Candle. I was thrilled with the price Amazon was offering so I thought I would try them, but I think these might be old candles. The three I got have no smell when lit. So disappointing."
1,19-May-20,5,"True to description, a great candle! Seriously this candle rocks! Smells amazing, heavy scent but not overwhelmingly strong. It‚Äôs the exact candle from Yankee but less on price through amazon, no gimmicks! I will be repurchasing! 10/10 recommend."
1,5-Jan-20,5,Excellent quality These candles are the best. Lasts for a long time and last even longer if you put a candle topper on it.
1,2-Nov-19,5,Good Smells like Christmas
1,11-Sep-18,5,Smells like Christmas! One of our favorite Yankee Candle scents. Smells like Christmas! (and you can usually get it cheaper when it's not christmas)
1,19-Nov-20,5,My favorite scent came fast and excellent condition My favorite scent came fast and excellent condition
1,13-Nov-20,4,Great candle! Lovely little Christmas candle.
1,8-Dec-19,5,Saturated room with wonderful scent. Scent is very pleasant. Feels like i'm standing in a fresh evergreens forest. I'm completely satisfied with this purchase.
1,25-Oct-20,5,Very fast shipping and nice candle Very fast shipping and nice candle
1,25-Aug-18,3,No Wick Bought the candle back in June and had not had a chance to use it until now. Opened it up and no wick. Dug around looking for it but nothing. Too late to return and Yankee Candle would not work with me on the warranty because I bought it through a 3rd party. Check the candle for a wick when you receive and don't get burned by waiting too long. Smells great though.
1,19-Feb-19,5,"One of my favorite Christmas scents I order this candle every year for the holidays and we always go through it during the season. Smells like evergreen, cedar an a hint of the bayberry candles my mom burned when I was little. Love it!"
1,3-Dec-19,5,"Try it at deal, and smell good. My apartment isn't very big. When I light this candle jar, the scent is full of the room, which makes me enjoyable. I ordered it at a very good price. So the price makes me more satisfied with this purchase."
1,23-Nov-19,5,I Love This Candle Amazing throw. Delicious Christmas tree scent with a sweet undertone. Clean smell. I love the amount you receive in the jar for the price. People in my life need to make note. I love this. Will purchase again.
1,13-Nov-20,5,Not sweet... more of a spice It isn't as sweet as I was hoping for.  It has a slice scent to it.
1,22-Feb-20,5,"Fragrance is most important! A very nice candle, good smell, wish it could have lasted more hours but let's be realistic, it's a candle."
1,10-Dec-17,2,Lightly scented This candle is disappointing. I usually love Yankee Candle but this item specifically has to be burning for several hours before there is a strong scent. That‚Äôs nice for people with sensitivities but I have a fake tree and want my house to smell like a real one.
1,5-Jan-20,5,Yummy smell This is one of my go to gifts when I am looking for a gift for family or a friend. Yankee candle never disappoints.
1,10-Apr-19,3,To me no longer worth the high price. ?üòü I burn Yankee candles in my 3 bedroom home and it filled the house with it's scent. The 4 I have purchased this year don't fill a studio apartment. Disappointed
1,8-Dec-19,5,Mmmm Now it smells like Christmas
1,4-Feb-20,5,"Mmmm love Yankee & Apple! Love Yankee candles and really love anything Apple scent.  Beautiful, long lasting, and awesome scent!"
1,15-Nov-20,3,Just ok. Appears to be very fadded.
1,23-Dec-18,5,Smells like the holidays Shipped perfectly. No problems. Smells just like a christmas tree and makes the house feel more festive. Ive always felt yankee candles are too expensive but it was worth the money.
1,27-Sep-19,5,Great Buy Great Buy
1,12-Jan-20,5,Favorite holiday candle I always have Home for the Holidays candle scent burning during the holidays. My number one favorite smelling candle of all time.
1,26-Dec-17,5,Christmas in a jar Hands down the best Christmas candle out there. This one is priced lower than anywhere else and lasts and lasts.
1,24-Jan-19,5,Smells just like the name I got this for someone as a Christmas gift and almost didn‚Äôt give it to them it smelled just like we had baked cookies ! Definitely worth the money ! It arrived on time and was wrapped  Securely So it wouldn‚Äôt brake .
1,1-Dec-17,1,"No scent to this candle. What a disappointment these candles are. I had a party and there was no scent, and certainly no scent of Christmas. The fact that Yankee Candle is selling this as a scented candle is really a misnomer. Please don't buy and waste your money as I did."
1,1-Dec-18,5,Christmas spirit Smells strongly like a Christmas tree. It‚Äôs going to keep the house smelling like Christmas long after the real tree stops smelling so good naturally. Mine came in tact and in great shape
1,15-Jan-20,4,"Full Scent, Long Lasting This candle has a particularly strong scent, which really fills any room. I was burning it recently when a friend came to visit‚Äîhe said it smelled like Christmas!"
1,4-Mar-20,5,DELICIOUS SCENT! It smells wonderful! I keep it on my nightstand so I can smell it when I‚Äôm in bed.
1,30-Sep-18,5,"so it's the good quality candle you'd expect at a good price I got this on lightening deal, so it's the good quality candle you'd expect at a good price. I like the smell."
1,31-May-20,1,"Smells great, but leaves soot Left soot marks on my wall and bed!! :( It completely burned up overnight. Didn't even last 10 hours"
1,21-Dec-19,5,"Watch for the above sale of you want a quantity. No complaints!  Scent is my favorite.  Yankee Candle usually puts these on sale near Xmas, 5 for $55 + shipping."
1,2-Feb-19,5,"Makes a great Christmas gift. Oh, the smell of Christmas! If you don't or cant have a real Christmas tree, this is the next best thing, you dont even have to light it, just remove the lid and set it on your coffee table, it smells like you have a real Christmas tree."
1,29-Dec-19,3,Disappointed Disappointed in this Yankee Scent. The throw is incredibly weak. Not what I expected or pay for.
1,16-Nov-20,3,"A little on expensive side Expensive,I was disappointed in the size."
1,21-Dec-19,5,"Can't go wrong with Yankee Candles Burns clean. Fragrance is strong, not overpowering. Adds the perfect touch to your Christmas decor."
1,28-Oct-20,5,Love It The candle smells AMAZING & shipped safely
1,22-Jan-20,5,BEST CANDLE! I get this candle every year and absolutely LOVE the fragrance.  Everyone who comes into our home compliments me on the aroma.  I even got a few to give for holiday gifts and they were appreciated.
1,17-Dec-18,2,"Disappointed I‚Äôm disappointed because fragrance is  just OK,  you can hardly smell it. Plus, the tall cylinder glass does not allow the wicks to breathe and halfway through they keep going out."
1,27-Oct-20,1,"Can‚Äôt be real , doesn‚Äôt smell like anything Doesn‚Äôt smell like anything"
1,5-Feb-20,5,Smells amazing Love this scent. One of my faves. Smells exactly like xmas cookies. Highly recommended
1,9-Nov-20,5,"My very favorite candles I dislike nothing about this product, and love the aroma."
1,7-Oct-19,5,The candles were great and they were delivered quickly. The candles were great as always with Yankee candles. I love to burn them for fallholidays and get togethers.
1,4-Jul-19,5,Strong scent at a great price. Strong scent. Slow burn. Great price.
1,19-Sep-20,5,great smell reminds me of christmas stores :)
1,11-Jun-20,5,"perfect great shipping, packaging, and scent. Love this candle!"
1,6-Nov-20,5,Best Candles I‚Äôve used . I like heavy scents ! I want to smell it ! Yankee candles are the best for scent strength- lasts long time and they are great for gifts . I just ordered 10 different ones for myself and others . Top of the line and I‚Äôve tried so many others !
1,13-Nov-20,4,Great scent! Love yankee candles!
1,25-Jun-20,5,Received shattered glass Received shattered glass and cut my hand ...bloody mess
1,25-Dec-19,2,"NO SCENT!! As stated above, no scent and it wick is short as instructed and it burned for over 4 hours!"
1,21-Nov-20,5,Love it Packaged perfectly
1,20-Apr-20,5,Smells like the holidays One of my favorite scents. It reminds me of the holidays and adds warmth to a room.
1,20-Nov-19,5,So happy Love this scent.  These are the only candles my sensitive nose will tolerate.  This is the cheapest I have found them
1,30-Mar-20,5,Great price Good price great scent. Product arrived a day early would order again.
1,25-May-20,5,Smells great! It does last a long time and the fragrance is wonderful.
1,17-Nov-20,5,"Perfect gift Love it, so sweet"
1,27-Dec-17,5,Absolutely wonderful Definitely a Must-Have! Love this scent. Smells very much of apples and cinnamon. If you like Kitchen Spice of Autumn Wreath you will love this one too. First chance I will get my back-up to this one.
1,15-Feb-20,5,Good Christmas type smell. This candle has a pleasant scent. It lasted a while & reminds me of Christmas.
1,6-Jul-20,5,"Christmas is near, be candle ready Nothing beats a YANKEE Candle and sale price."
1,7-Jul-20,3,Received wrong scent Unfortunately I received the wrong scent. I received coconut in stead of balsam fir. Keeping it because the scent is ok and not worth the trouble to exchange.
1,28-Dec-19,5,Smells great and burns a long time! I love the smell of this. So fresh and wintery ‚Äî perfect if you want your house to be cozy!
1,20-Aug-20,5,Smells so good. Very nice candle and smells great.
1,15-Jan-17,5,"Great Candle! This candle is perfect for making you home smell like the Holidays! I love the smell of Christmas Wreathes, so this candle was like a little piece of heaven. I really enjoyed the scent and the potency. Yankee Candles are made with very high quality."
1,12-May-20,5,Yankee Candles rarely disappoint Good scent. Thats the hard part. Will you like the scent.
1,10-Nov-20,5,Wonderful fragrance My sons favorite
1,2-Mar-19,3,"Life time Yankee lover I've bought Yankee candles for years.  But, these 2 wick candles not only burn twice as fast as the large jars they have no fragrance, they smell like wax."
1,2-Apr-20,5,Love this scent Makes your home smell like the holidays whenever you light it up.
1,27-Feb-20,5,"Better deal then Yankee Store, real deal, will buy again One of my favorite candles smells like could eat it!Smells my whole house up!"
1,11-Jan-20,5,A Nice gift to give and receive Very nice scent and it last a long time too.  I‚Äôve had them before and I will get more in the future
1,4-Oct-20,2,"Weak/No throw, but a good scent. The smell is nice, it‚Äôs too bad I can‚Äôt smell it unless I am right above the jar. I probably won‚Äôt light this again."
1,14-Jan-20,5,Nice candle Long lasting scent. Everyone who comes over when I‚Äôm burning this candle always says how good it smells when they walk in and it‚Äôs not too overbearing.
1,4-Jul-19,5,cedar smell perfect cedar tree smell
1,17-Nov-19,5,Christmas anytime you want! It smells like Christmas in November! It candle has longevity and smells amazing! Will be buying again!
1,23-Jan-19,2,Overpriced in this buyers opinion You can get similar scented candles that work just as long for literally 1/8th the price if this candle is not on sale when you buy it.Not sure why the massive markup. But it is a nice smelling long lasting candle. Just crazy expensive.
1,20-Feb-20,5,Wonderful Scent The scent is delicious and stays even when not lit.  I will be buying more
1,15-Dec-18,1,Smelled good whrn opened but.... it's been lit for a few ours and no odor at all....very disappointed in Yankee
1,13-Dec-18,5,"My Favorite Candle Ever I bought this candle a good while back while it was on sale (probably for around 10-13 dollars), because it was on sale. I didn't know what it would smell like but now that I've burned through most of it I have to say it is without a doubt the most unique and incredible smelling candle ever, coming from someone who sniffs every one I pass in the store. It smells like winter, but so much better. I find it incredibly comforting- if you're wavering, pick it up."
1,29-Dec-18,5,Cozy scent on a winter night! I don‚Äôt understand all the negative reviews on this scent as this is by far one of my favorite ones!  Very pleasant light sent love it especially in the winter time !
1,7-Dec-19,4,"Sometimes these scents can be overbearing but this is just right. Before relighting wick, take a tissue & remove the ‚Äúextra‚Äù burned wick to keep candle neat & without ‚Äòfloaters‚Äô."
1,15-Oct-19,5,Found it. I fell in love with this scent christmas cookie two years ago. Been trying to find it and now it's back. The smell reminds me of christmas day.
1,19-Nov-20,1,No scent There is no scent at all
1,4-Feb-20,5,Great candle Omg so awesome!! Smells yummy and the price was awesome!! Always love the fast FREE shipping !!
1,26-Jan-19,5,"YUMMY! This scent smells so wonderful!  It's like Christmas in a jar. And it's seasonal, so I had to buy it. I definitely recommend this! Buy it! Great value for the money!"
1,12-May-20,5,Smells Great! This is one of my favorite scents by Yankee Candles.
1,19-Nov-20,1,Don‚Äôt buy Yankee Candle; waste of money. This candle had no scent.  I left it burning for 3 hours & still no scent. Would never buy this brand again!  I used to buy Yankee Candles a lot and you could smell it all over the house. Now you smell nothing. Very disappointed!
1,21-Jan-20,5,Happy with my candle I enjoy my candle gave 2 for Xmas gifts I sure they will love there's as much as I  enjoy mine
1,10-Jan-18,5,Five Stars My most favorite candle!
1,21-Sep-20,1,"Garbage: NO SCENT! Supposedly Balsam & Cedar. There's no scent to it at all, surprisingly for Yankee Candle I guess. Just awful. Save your money."
1,22-Dec-18,5,Love that smell. There is nothing as nice as yankee balsom fir candles. The aroma is strong pine and the candle has many hours of burning. Great price for gifts or yourself to enjoy.
1,11-May-20,5,Great Candle Smell The is such a calming and pleasant smelling candle.
1,10-Nov-20,3,Smells like Pine Sol. oh well.
1,24-Feb-20,3,Not the scent I was looking for Not the scent I was looking for. Very sweet smell. I didn't like it.
1,23-Oct-16,3,"Just OK Only 3 stars because it came with another candle and both were barely wrapped. The other candle was shattered. This one more dense so it made it without breakage. Scent is OK. Not great but not bad either. Plus, it's a Yankee candle so I know it will last."
1,9-Feb-19,3,"smells nice but....... smells nice but sickly sweet & I know christmas cookies are sweet cookies but i dont want to smell sugar in my house, i'm trying to lose weight over here"
1,10-Jun-20,1,bad product sold! i noticed a crack on the glass. i want to return it but it says the return window closed yesterday. what a waste of money!
1,7-Jan-20,2,"Weak scent I was greatly looking forward to using this candle because it was tied to emotions from my childhood.  We used this candle around Christmas time growing up.  I bought it hoping it would envelop the room with the same scent.  Sadly,  I could barely smell it even if it was burning a few hours."
1,14-Feb-20,5,Hanging with you guys again When you come home with a hangover it‚Äôs a great night for ya candles
1,31-Jan-20,5,Great buy This a great smelling candle I bought these on Black Friday for 50% off
1,8-Dec-19,5,"My Favorite Holiday Candle This is my favorite Holiday candle.  It smells like Christmas trees to me.  Since I have a artificial tree, we don['t have that fresh pine needle smell...this candle is my way of bringing back the smell of Christmas to our house.  It really makes  Christmas so special."
1,13-May-20,5,"Can never go wrong with Yankee and Christmas No chips,cracks..excellent condition!  Love it!"
1,30-Jul-19,5,Great Smells nice
1,3-Jan-20,1,"No scent As long as I can remember Yankee Candles were always amazing. My husband surprised me by ordering 2 yankee candles, and the scent was very subtle when you open them and had very little to NO throw when lit. I was very disappointed!! For half the price you can get a candle at the grocery store with more throw than these! Very disappointed"
1,21-Mar-20,5,Lasts and great scent Love Yankee candles Buy for myself my daughters and friends
1,13-Jan-20,5,Got for sister for Christmas My sister liked it as her Christmas gift. Smells nice. She likes candles.
1,29-Jan-20,5,Great gift Yankee candles never let me down. This was a gift and it was perfect!
1,13-Dec-19,1,Worst candle ever! Not typical Yankee Candle at all...wax melted and pulled away from glass inside upon shipping. Looks Terrible. Not Happy at ALL!
1,21-Jan-20,5,"My favorite candle for the holidays! Loved this candle, made my entire house smell like the holidays! Will buy again!"
1,13-Jan-20,5,Wonderful!! Love these candles. Really brightens the room and fills it with deliciousness!
1,8-Oct-20,5,LOVE THE FREGNANCE LOVE IT.
1,28-Feb-20,5,A gift for a friend. She loved it! Excellent scent.  My friend was thrilled at the large size!
1,12-Dec-18,3,"Not my favorite All the reviews for this scent were five stars.  Have to say it's not my favorite scent, though.  Really doesn't remind me of Christmas.  It arrived undamaged."
1,28-Nov-19,5,Love this scent! Love this classic scent! Came exactly as it would have in a Yankee Candle store.
1,9-Dec-19,5,"Amazing scent, candle burns wonderfully Absolutely my favorite scent!"
1,10-Feb-19,3,Where‚Äôs the fragrance I love?? Bummer!!  Ordered one at the beginning of the holiday season and I loved it!  Ordered two more and neither of them have any fragrance at all. ?üòû
1,19-Nov-14,5,"Very Merry Scent My favorite scent for the holiday's! People walk in my house and comment right away at how nice it smells. Which is saying something since we have two dogs and a wood burning fireplace. This candle is not over powering, just enough and the scent is very festive and welcoming."
1,14-Dec-18,3,"Not fragrant There is very little fragrance in this candle.  I think it‚Äôs probably old, maybe left over from last year.  I have to hold the candle to my nose toget the fragrance.  Disappointing because it‚Äôs more than I would normally pay for a candle.  I have looked for the bayberry scented candle for years, hoping for a better price than Yankee Candle."
1,26-Mar-19,5,"Amazing smell - long lasting I burned this candle every day for like 2 ¬?/2 months after I got it. It smells amazing, I could smell it in the hallway through a closed door. I recommend burning long enough for the whole top of the candle to become a pool of wax before extinguishing, as the candle will burn most evenly that way. I never had to trim the wick."
1,5-May-19,4,"Pretty good cande, but ... ‚Ä¶ It doesn't really have the bayberry smell that I loved so much when I was a kid. I wish I could get those kinds of candles."
1,18-Nov-19,5,"Great product! Very strong scent, and these candles last a LONG time."
1,21-Feb-20,5,Yum! One of my favorite scents.  Delightful and not overpowering.
1,20-Dec-16,3,No scent! So disappointed. Shipment of this item was very fast. I was disappointed in the candle itself as it makes it smell when you first open the jar but after you lighted it does not make any scent. I was really hoping to make nice house smell Christmasy...
1,15-Jan-19,5,Loved the candle I purchased this candle and cannot say enough about how well the jar was packed.  It arrived safely in two boxes for protections.  Smells good too.
1,1-May-19,3,No cumpli?? lo que esperaba Pienso que la marca que las produce debe poner m?°s atenci??n a las fragancias pues el olor es muy d?©bil y casi no se siente b
1,6-May-20,5,Great candle! Smells soooo good and lasts a long time!
1,18-May-20,2,Not what I expected sadly :/ I‚Äôm obsessed w the bath and body works fresh balsam so I thought I‚Äôd give this one a try and it doesn‚Äôt come close to or compare :( I was sad
1,26-Aug-19,1,"Ordered Balsam and Cedar twice. Received French Vanilla both times. I was expecting to get the correct scent.  tried on 2 separate occasions and each time received French Vanilla... unusable to me, as I do not like the sweeter scents.  Yankee Candle, you may want to check the boxes, I fear they are ALL filled with French Vanilla. Still hoping for Balsam and Cedar..."
1,25-Dec-18,5,"The best smelling candle The scent of this candle brings the pine forest right into my home. No need to say any more, it‚Äôs delicious smelling"
1,30-Aug-20,5,aroma love candles
1,18-Oct-20,3,Good but not great Scent is great but didn‚Äôt last long and is not strong. Go to Walmart instead. Those pine candles are much better
1,13-Feb-20,5,"The quality and price Delivery was quick, secured package and great quality candle."
1,11-Feb-20,5,"As Described, beautiful smell. The smell is very good the color is awesome.  Love Yankee."
1,7-Mar-20,5,Best scent ever! This is my absolute favorite scent! It's a nice strong scent and lasts a long time. I never get tired of this one.
1,20-Dec-19,5,Yankee candles are the best! Can not go wrong with a yankee candle. Clean burning and a soft scent.
1,12-Mar-20,1,"Don't waste your money Did not like this product. No scent, before and/or after burning at all...."
1,2-Jul-20,5,"Very nice smell This is a wonderful candle, the smell is delightful, the candle itself is attractive. The Yankee Candles are well priced for gift giving."
1,22-Dec-19,5,The scent of Christmas If you want your house to smell like Christmas this is def6the candle to buy
1,2-Nov-19,5,Nice candle Nice scent
1,25-Jun-20,5,"It's Yankee! You can't go wrong! Loved the smell, reminds you of a live Christmas tree. Great aroma for any time of the year. You just can't go wrong with a Yankee Candle. This is one of my favorites."
1,8-Jan-20,5,"Quality Love yankee candles, lasted very long and really love the scent"
1,20-Nov-18,4,great candle wick doesn't burn evenly- candle has lots of wax that is not burned.
1,1-Jun-20,5,Smells good. Makes room smell like forest.
1,16-Mar-17,5,Love this smell One of my favorrite scents by yankee candle.  Even though it shows a christmas picture on the label I use this scent year round.  It ªs not over powering but the scent is strong enough to fill a large open room.
1,10-Jan-20,5,Great gift! Great smelling holiday candle. Bayberry is getting so hard to find!
1,18-Dec-18,3,"Red Apple Wreath The candle smells okay, but the scent doesn't last, which is an issue with MOST yankee candles. For that price, it should last more than 2 minutes."
1,28-Jan-18,5,This is my favorite Christmas candle This is my favorite Christmas candle. I use an artificial tree and one thing I miss is the scent of fresh pine. This fits the bill without being overly strong or sharply pine smelling. It is a distinct yet soft pine smell and I love it!
1,4-Jan-20,1,Don‚Äôt buy!! Came melted from sitting in factory every one I ordered was bad
1,15-Dec-18,5,Great Candle Purchased as a gift. Yankee Candles have a great reputation for a reason. Amazing scent and longevity. The price can not be beat. Highly recommended
1,13-Jan-20,5,Great Love this scent and cheaper than getting from Yankee Candle!
1,15-Jan-20,5,"Great Gift A little pricey, but most candles this large are. I gifted this to my mother for Christmas, as it is her favorite scent. She loves it."
1,23-Dec-19,5,"Wonderful Perfect candle to get the house in the holiday spirit, very fresh and subtle"
1,11-Jan-20,1,Useless I have to be very very close to the bottle to get the smell.
1,10-Mar-20,5,Beautiful scent without being overwhelming. Our family's favorite candle scent during the holidays. Fills your home with a beautiful scent that is not overwhelming but inviting. Great way to bring comfort and homeliness into your home.
1,19-Feb-20,4,Loved the price. Love these candles but only when deeply discounted.
1,7-Mar-20,5,"Great candle Loved this yankee candle! Lovely, long lasting scent!"
1,4-Jun-20,5,"Great value, usually cost more. Absolutely wonderful scent!"
1,17-Dec-19,5,"Great smaell Since we have a fake tree, this helps to give that real tree scent."

1,19-Feb-20,5,Love them Love Yankee candle. This is one of my favorites.
1,17-Jan-20,5,Reminds me of apple picking in the fall I love the smell of this candle. It reminds me of childhood family outings to pick apples and drink cider surrounded by trees set ablaze with leaves of a million colors.
1,20-Feb-20,5,Love it Fast Shipping and as stated in ad merchandise .
1,20-Jul-20,5,I love this! I love this!
1,2-Jan-20,3,Not great Pretty much just smells like vanilla and it isn't very strong.
1,1-Mar-18,3,"Thought I was getting a good deal, but found out that I could‚Äôve saved ... Thought I was getting a good deal, but found out that I could‚Äôve saved $10.00 a piece at our local craft store for the same exact thing!"
1,27-Nov-12,5,"Great smelling candle I have a faux Christmas tree and people actually walk up to the tree, take a deep breath and comment how great the tree smells not realizing it's the candle they're smelling.  It's a very faint smell that seems to come and go. This will definitely be a recurring purchase every holiday season."
1,25-Jan-20,5,Overall awesome candle Everything about this candle is awesome. The smell is like that of a pine tree but more mellow. The only downside was the smell would go back and fourth between strong and weak (the area it would cover). Ending on a good note I would recommend giving this a try!
1,20-Nov-20,5,Best holiday scent EVER!!! I LOVE these candles! My favorite holiday scent! (You could say I‚Äôm obsessed) They ship in a very secure (non breakable)container. I‚Äôve ordered them multiple times and never had a problem.
1,6-Dec-19,5,The perfect Christmas candle! Smells just like my Christmas tree.  Love the scent.  Great buy!
1,27-Nov-19,5,So Good smells like those cedar disks you put in your closet and Christmas trees put together. It's a wonderful natural scent. reminds me of the mountains.

1,3-Aug-20,4,Scent lasted until the very end... Great Product
1,18-Jan-20,1,"NOT ENOUGH SCENT,  BUT COLOURFUL I'M DISAPPOINTED IN THIS CANDLE.I WILL NOT BUY IT AGAIN."
1,11-Dec-18,5,SO CHEAP FOR THE LARGEST SIZE CANT GET ANY BETTER!! These usually go for $30 if you buy this large candle off the yankee candle website and on here I paid less than $14 for this!!!! Amazon is killing it.
1,25-Feb-20,5,"Smells great! It smelled great, but didnt burn very well."
1,6-Mar-20,5,Great scent! Love this smell!!! Not all Bayberry smells are alike! This one is wonderful.
1,9-Dec-19,1,"Don‚Äôt order!! Glass is smashed, ordered a replacement and that was also smashed. I don‚Äôt appreciate broken glass in my house two times."

1,20-Nov-19,3,"Okay for the price It has a very sweet, fake smell. I've had lot's of christmas tree scented candles, and this one is really strong and the least accurate scent. For something very cheap it's fine, but not great."
1,16-Feb-20,5,Good deal This is my favorite smell. I'm glad amazon had it on sale.
1,24-Dec-19,5,BACK IN MOM'S CHRISTMAS KITCHEN The aroma reminded me of my mom's kitchen at Christmas! It was just like her vanilla icing.

1,23-Jan-19,5,Love the smell! I love it! Who doesn‚Äôt want it to smell like Christmas in the house! Especially when you have fake Christmas trees to decorate the candle helped bring the spirit to life in the house
1,14-Mar-20,2,Very little scent Not much of a scent. Won't buy again
1,27-May-19,5,Candle The wake is little too small every time I lite it at 8th inch tall and burned out automatically
1,23-May-20,4,Candle Nose? Nose candle? You are going to have to put your nose in the candle.
1,3-May-19,1,Poor scent Too little scent
1,28-Jan-20,5,Lovely fragrance Reminds me of childhood vacations on Cape Cod
1,26-Dec-19,1,"Disappointed This is one of my favorite candle scents and I have purchased it in the past. However, this candle does not have a strong scent at all. I was very disappointed especially given the cost."

1,4-Oct-20,5,Nice attractive candle. Attractive and very aromayic
1,26-Dec-17,4,Cozy Winter Smell I was trying to find a smell that was similar to a candle that I can only buy if I was a wholesaler. Can't go wrong with Yankee!
1,8-Jan-18,2,"Better luck next time Was hoping for a cleaner, fresher scent that would open up the air.  Instead it's just too heavy and closed for what I needed.  Willuse it up, but won't reorder.  Ah, well.  Better luck next time."
1,14-Mar-20,5,"Christmas Tree Smell Amazing, smells like Christmas!"
1,28-Mar-18,5,Smells wonderful This particular candle is one of the best smelling candles that Yankee Candle makes. It is only available at Christmas time so I tend to buy a lot and it will make your room smell wonderful.

1,20-Oct-20,1,Very Poor Quality The scent is very weak and the flame keeps going out after the wax caved into itself and is now flooding over the wick when I try to light it. Very disappointed in the quality of this candle. I‚Äôll be seeking a refund.
1,4-Jan-17,5,Smells like the forest Yankee candles are one of the few I can burn without getting a headache from the fragrance.  This is one of my favorites.  It reminds me of walking through a grove of coniferous trees in the forest.

1,13-Feb-20,5,"My favorite Christmas scent in a candle. I always purchased one large Yankee candle in this scent every year for Christmas, and guests often comment on how great my home smells while it‚Äôs burning."
1,11-Feb-19,2,"Need better packaging. I love the scent, one of my favorites by far! Yankee Candles are always worth the money you pay. They last quite awhile & the smell is amazing! Although, I actually would have liked to use this! It was delivered to my hands, which I put down long enough to close the door. I immediately opened it, excited, to discover the jar it came in was broken in quite a few pieces.  Very disappointed."

1,12-Dec-15,5,"Wonderful Scent! This is the best most accurate bayberry scent on the market.  No other ""bayberry"" candle or wax melt compares.  The bayberry scent is wonderful this time of year, especially if you have a fake Christmas tree because it just smells like a real tree."
1,21-Nov-19,2,Yankee candle Front of candle was not neat plastic bunches up cannot give as gift will try to order another one

1,12-Sep-19,5,gift as described
1,14-Nov-11,5,"Makes the whole house smell great. Around Thanksgiving, I switch from amber or vanilla type candles to cedar and balsam. Gives the house a more holiday feel. These candles last a long time. If they smoke or flicker funny, I just trim the wick a little more and it stops. Plus the candles burn more evenly. Will buy again."

1,12-Jan-20,1,Not up to Yankee quality I was wondering if these were real Yankee candles. They hardly smell and don't burn the same. I must have received these from the reject pile.
1,10-Feb-20,5,Smells like buttercream Great classic scent!
1,23-Dec-19,5,Great scent Great scent. True to it‚Äôs description.
1,25-Jun-16,1,"What faint scent existed was so horrible, I could not stand it Problem was not with Amazon.  Problem was with the Yankee Candle itself.  There was NO scent of balsam and cedar.  What faint scent existed was so horrible, I could not stand it. Now just to be certain I was not having problems with my ""smeller"" I passed it around to some folks I had attending a social function I was hosting.  ""ALL"" turned away quuickly when they got a whiff, and suggested I ""blow out"" and ""throw out"" immediately.  It was awful.  So it was returned to Amazon who quickly refunded my money.  Yankee Candles, always expensive, are supposed to be the best........no soot, great,strong aroma that could smell up an entire room.  Not anymore.  This will be my last ""Yankee"" candle ever.  Please do not waste your money.  I did have an Ashland Candle (supposedly made by Yankee) that smelled wonderful.  Go figure. Have no idea what was wrong.......except perhaps it was very old.  Do not go there, my advice."
1,21-Sep-20,2,"Doesn‚Äôt give off a smell, you have to Doesn‚Äôt really smell like anything."

1,24-Feb-20,3,Very weak scent Very faint scent. Not what I would expect from Yankee
1,6-Nov-20,5,Very nice Very nice
1,12-Mar-18,5,Amazing smell The best ‚Äúwinter‚Äù smell there is! I have bought this candle over and over.
1,17-Dec-19,5,Yankee candle amazing I love this candle brand. Even more if it has a sale. That's gives me a chance to try a new one. This smell is perfect! Not too strong and not to weak. I LOVE THIS CANDLE. Will but more?üíó?üíó?üíó?üíó?üíó?üíó

1,21-Jan-20,5,Excellent price I bought this for a friend for Christmas.  This was the best price I could find for a Yankee candle and the scent I was looking for.
1,22-Nov-20,1,"Fake yankee candle, don‚Äôt buy. Weak scent, smaller size, not even close. It‚Äôs fake, not a real yankee candle, hence the half off price. Says large jar, I own several, it‚Äôs not even the same size as a real large jar yankee candle."
1,30-Oct-14,5,Really like this as I used to use cookies & cream ... The smell makes you think cookies are being baked in the house. Really like this as I used to use cookies & cream but can't seem to find it any more. You can't go wrong with this smell. Highly recommend this company.
1,31-Jan-19,5,‚?êÔ?è‚?êÔ?è‚?êÔ?è‚?êÔ?è‚?êÔ?è I love Yankee Candle have been using there holiday scents for 20 years! Always perfect

1,9-Jan-20,5,Burns evenly Beautiful smell
1,12-Jan-18,3,Fragrant Foul This candle smells like somebody jammed the entire forest up my nose and then set it on fire. In all seriousness: way too fragrant/perfumey; not at all subtle.Given the size of the candle I can guarantee you will grow weary of its aroma.
1,24-Nov-19,5,Smells great and good price Very good deal
1,6-Feb-18,5,Smeels great - not too strong Bought it for the holidays to have that tree smell with the artificial tree. Smeels great - not too strong. Still use it daily.

1,20-Dec-19,2,Does not smell like balsam and cedar This candle has a fairly overpowering scent which unfortunately is not close to the Christmas Tree smell I was expecting. It is taking a long time to burn which would be good if the smell was enjoyable.
1,22-Jun-19,5,Loved Smells great
1,28-Sep-20,1,"Scent is not what I expected The scent is overwhelming, too sickening sweet. Not at all like Bayberry. I guess it's the snow dust that makes it bad."

1,27-Mar-19,5,The best candle ever! Great quality and long lasting
1,28-Dec-19,5,It smells like fresh baked cookies Smells good!
1,22-Feb-20,1,Meh Smell was like an old lady's perfume. Only lasted about a month on my warmer.
1,19-Dec-18,2,Nothing Christmasy about this Smell! This candle has a cloying nearly cherry-like smell. After burning a few times I cut my losses and threw it away.
1,30-Dec-13,5,"The Scent of Bayberry will make your Holiday When I was young, my mother would always burn a Bayberry candle.  Bayberry has its own wonderful, distinct fragrance, very rich and warm.I have tried many candles over the years to duplicate the Bayberry scent from long ago.  This candle is a perfect match.  I promise you will not be disappointed.  Even my adult children, said that the smell reminded them of their Grandma and her magical Christmas's."
1,10-Jan-20,5,Great candle at a great value Wonderful scent and candle burns evenly

1,18-Feb-15,5,Winter in a jar. Smells just like Christmas. It gives off the illusion that you are sitting in a ski lodge. Just have some hot cocoa with it and your living room will be transformed from the drab place you escape the cold to the warm shelter you never want to leave.

1,21-Dec-19,4,"Long lasting, but not strong Overall - good candle, but the only hitch is that the scent wasn‚Äôt very strong. You could smell it right next to the candle but it wasn‚Äôt a candle that filled the room with amazing scents."

1,24-Aug-15,5,Yankee Candles Make a Great Gift I bought the Balsam Yankee Candle as a gift for a friend who had a stroke prior to Christmas. I had it delivered to her home as she lives o good distance from me. She was very pleased with the candle.
1,27-Apr-19,5,Great Perfect
1,8-Oct-18,5,Five Stars Great Christmas sent! Great price! Packaged nicely
1,16-Feb-16,2,Could barely smell this Christmas candle - Not good I sent this candle back.  It produced almost no scent in the house.  I had others smell it to make sure it wasn't just me.  Yankee Candle used to have strong scents.... maybe this one was an oddball?
1,19-Dec-13,3,"nice could be better for the price... for some reason I seem to be striking out on my on line yankee candles.. they either smell old, no smell, or have a bad odor.. I guess I will have to start ordering directly from Yankee.  Hate to do that, but if I am going to pay the full price for a nice candle, I 'll have to shop elsewhere for them.  it is too bad.  I love the convenience of using Amazon for all of my on line shopping.. Amazon makes me feel good about shopping with them.. not like other on line companys that shall remain nameless."
1,22-Feb-20,4,"Nice scent but smokey My main issue, it gets very smoky!"
1,12-Dec-19,5,"The smell is amazing! I‚Äôm not able to have a Christmas tree up this year, this smells like I‚Äôve got a live tree every night I light it! Beautiful scent and stays lit!"
1,19-Dec-19,1,Candles had no scent Purchased this candle for my mother and aunt. The candles did not have any scent. Don't bother purchasing.

1,17-Dec-19,5,Love the smell One of my favorite Christmas time scents!
1,4-Mar-19,5,Just buy it !!!! Awsome!!!!!!!!!!!
1,26-Dec-18,1,"No scent at all I purchased two of these, one in Sugar Cookie and one in Red Apple Wreath. Neither of the candles throws any scent at all other than smelling like a match had been lit in the house. I threw them away after several times burning them. There was no point in having them."

1,9-Dec-12,5,"Favorite Candle Yankee candles in general are great in that they last forever, burn evenly, and are generally pretty. And for those reasons, they are worth the price. The ""Christmas Cookie"" scent is a wonderful change from regular Vanilla and is versatile to burn all year round. The scent is strong enough to be noticed but not overpowering. The only drawback to this candle is that it might induce cravings for cookies!!"

1,13-May-18,5,Five Stars The best
1,3-Dec-19,5,"Love Yankee Love the smell, my house smells amazing. Great deal!"

1,16-Jun-14,5,"Illuminations? It is my understanding that Yankee Candle acquired the Illuminations Candle company, which had been our favorite.  We do not find the Yankee Candles to be as long-lasting nor with the intensity of fragrance.  But, I guess it's the best we can do.  The candle arrived on time and undamaged.I am not saying Yankee Candles are bad, just we preferred the Illumination Candles."

This is one of my very favorite scents and I‚Äôve been buying it for many years (over 10 at least) and it could easily fill my house with yumminess. The candle I received had a muted cold smell but NOTHING once lit. I‚Äôve never had this happen with any Yankee Candle.

1,22-Oct-16,1,"No smell I should have returned because of the lack of smell while burning.  I am so disappointed in Yankee Candle Company, I've always paid more because they always smelled stronger than less expensive candles.  This candle burned for hours and I could not smell it when I went outside then returned to the room."
1,9-May-17,1,They need to replace with a different scent that actually has one Wow this is the first candle I have bought from Yankee Candle that literally has hardley any smell. I would be better off just bying glade. It literally had no scent and usually they smell up the whole house. Guess I should have stuck with cupcake or the bunny one. So disappointed after all I spent.

1,19-Dec-13,1,"Bad smeller This actually smells old and leaves a waxy smell and almost smells like a dirty cat box. I was planning on giving this to my mother for Christmas to go with her candle wax burner. :(Had to substitute it with one I already had. Very upset about it. They cost so much, they should live up to the price and if they are being sold old or as one that is no longer being made, they should let people know that they have been on a shelf for a while . therefore the consumer can make that decision whether to take a chance on an older candle."

1,18-Jan-16,5,"Totally worth it. I ordered this candle around Christmas time. It smells so good. Whenever I light it, the whole house smells like cookies. It has a light scent but it is still powerful. I love everything from the scent to the container of the candle. The candle burns for a very long time. Yankee candles are always very large, I love that. The glass is very sturdy glass. I have knocked this candle over many times and it has not broken. They are a little pricey, yet they are totally worth it."
1,11-Dec-14,3,"Three Stars I love Yankee candles, however this particular candle has almost no scent. Disappointing considering the price."
1,1-Jun-15,4,Four Stars Excellent scent
1,16-Dec-17,1,"Twizzlers. Yes, Twizzlers. I hate that I spent as much as I did on this candle. After reading all the rave reviews & hearing about it via YouTube all I can say is it smells like Twizzlers. That's it. That's all. $30 on a candle that smells like cherry licorice. Such a dissapointment."
1,5-Jan-15,5,Five Stars Nothing wrong

1,3-Jul-15,3,"Excellent bayberry fragrance Excellent bayberry fragrance, but the jar form makes it burn unevenly. I'd buy the fragrance again, but in a different container."
1,26-Jul-17,3,"Low scent It is the most beautiful clean scent, that reminds you of winter. It's too bad the that throw and stenght of the candle was about a 2 or 3."
1,9-Oct-16,5,Five Stars Love this scent
1,28-Mar-18,1,"I hate this smell so much I hate this smell so much. I thought it would be nice and calming, turns out to be one of the worst I've ever owned."
1,23-May-12,2,"Baynerry candle While I do love bayberry candles I was disappointed that it was not packaged correctly and the glass jar was broken therefore I could not use it. When I looked into exchanging it, it was noted that the item could not be returned/exchanged."

1,28-Feb-12,1,"What a mess Don't ever order Yankee Candles from Amazon.  I ordered them because the price was cheaper, but what I got was a package of broken glass.  They were wrapped so poorly that both candles were completely broken in several pieces.  I even cut my hand throwing them away, and obviously can't return them in the condition they were in."
1,20-Mar-18,1,One Star Hate this smell. Threw away. Nobody wanted it.
1,9-Aug-15,2,Two Stars Overpriced.
1,6-Dec-16,1,"... Yankee Candle Company products for years and was always satisfied until I bought the Balsam & Cedar Been purchasing Yankee Candle Company products for years and was always satisfied until I bought the Balsam & Cedar. Candle has almost no scent. I even moved it from a large room into a small one. I did pay sale price, so maybe it was their way of moving old product?"

1,21-Jan-14,2,Not what I thought Did not like the scent of the candle.  Will purchase future candles at candle shops; need to smell scents before deciding to purchase candles.
1,24-Aug-15,1,Melted??? Melted in the package
1,15-Apr-15,1,The fragrance which I love was overwhelming The jar was wrapped in packaging which was green and oily.  The fragrance which I love was overwhelming.  Leakage saturated it.  Was a mess to try to clean up.
1,24-Oct-16,2,"I don't like the smell at all I don't like the smell at all. I thought it should be a very light scent, but it is so strong once I opened it. ""Now our room smells like a massage place,"" said my roommate."

1,4-Dec-17,5,Five Stars This candle is sick.
1,6-Nov-10,1,"Christmas Wreath This is not a very good candle....I LOVE Yankee Candles because they smell great and strong and last pretty long...but this stupid thing smells like a cheapo one from Walgreens or something (perhaps I got a defected one). The smell is very faint and the flame is extremely high and smokey. A super waste of my money...If you want a candle that smells like a X-mas tree, I suggest Yankee's Balsam & Cedar (now, that is a great candle!)."
1,23-Feb-16,1,Destroyed I will just return this... Box is okay but this is just crushed
1,18-Oct-14,3,Three Stars The glass was shattered

1,20-Nov-16,5,Five Stars She loves Yankee
1,31-Dec-15,2,Not for me Should not have purchased a candle on line.  The scent is very sweet- thought it would more like a peppermint smell
1,29-Jan-15,2,Two Stars Product arrived broken :-/
1,30-Oct-16,1,What a waste! Not a real yankee candle! Don't waste your money!
1,24-Dec-16,5,Yankee candles are the best! Thank you for providing this product Yankee candles are the best!  Thank you for providing this product.
1,7-Dec-10,3,"NOT like Bath & Body Works' Balsam scent I know it's going out on a limb to purchase a scented candle I've never smelled in person.  However, based on the positive reviews, I hoped this would be similar to Bath & Body Works' ""Fresh Balsam"" scent, which is the very best ""Christmas-tree-like"" scent I've ever tried.  Unfortunately, the B & Bdy Works candles in this scent only come in wide, shorter jars and my candle warmer needs a taller jar.This candle is high-quality as far as being attractive in color and with good, strong fragrance.  It also fits my Hurricane Lamp candle warmer perfectly.  However, the fragrance itself is what I personally do not like.  It's a much more ""old-fashioned"" scent, reminding me of a candle my grandmother would have used back in the 70's or 80's."
1,25-Sep-14,1,One Star This item came completely smashed to pieces. So bummed!
1,25-Oct-20,5,"Exceptional Quality ?üå? I always have several Yankee candles burning in my home at one time, they are all in different rooms, and this is a year around activitie for me. This particular candle, the Balsam Cedar is one of my all time favorite fall and winter favorites, that I really enjoy burning. You will not be disappointed with the throw from this candle, in my opinion it's one of the best in their line. It smells really nice, yet it is notoverpowering. I would say this is one of my favorite candle scents from Yankee. The fragrance of this candle has a fresh forest/Christmas tree scent that would be expected, but I also get notes of sandalwood, and berries too. Actually all of the Yankee candles are known for smelling great, and being great quality. But, if you‚Äôre going to splash out on buying one, you want to make sure you‚Äôre getting the best Yankee Candle scents possible. Yankee makes sure to select good quality ingredients for their candles, as well as using high quality wax and natural wicks. So you can be sure you‚Äôll have a candle that won‚Äôt let you down. I highly recommend them, and they also make really great gifts. This is an honest and true review. I was not paid, nor did I recieve free product in exchange for my opinion or review. Shann?üíì"
1,15-Dec-17,1,"Avoid Yankee Candle like the plague Avoid Yankee Candle like the plague!  If you want scentless burning wax imbued with a lovely chemical smell this is the company for you!!  Yankee Candle, a former family-owned company sold their business a few years ago and the quality is now nonexistent.  I placed a huge order with YC as I've done for years because the candles and tarts always held their scent and I didn't worry about having to burn them before they ""went bad.""  So when my new order arrived which included Autumn, Holiday and everyday scents I was shocked to find every tart and jar had minimal scent and an overwhelming odor of wax and chemicals.  Some of the tarts were like a crumbled dust when unwrapped.  It's a darn shame what this new company has done to a well regarded brand but I suppose they'll buy a clue when they end up selling their overstock to low-end stores."
1,27-Jun-20,5,"my favorite scent i couldnt be comfy without. i am disabled, emotionally. being this way, makes me really sensory reliant and sensitive. scents, cant be to overbearing, or perfumy in my home, or i get instantly nauseous accompanied by a migraine. yankee candle hasnt given me a headache so far. im also really careful with what scents i buy, always buying a wax tart first, before spending the $27 on the large tumbler on amazon (i honestly couldnt suffice any more than that on a candle, therefore i come here). i look for the scents that bring me closer to fall and the colder months, this is one of my go to comfort scents that i keep in stock. i have a small 7oz tumbler, but it just went so fast, so i decided on the large tumbler. i only buy soy wax because it just burns cleaner and more even to me, and the cold scent throw is just as amazing. i hate w*m's hard overtly perfumed paraffin candles, i can always expect a headache from that big box chain stores low quality. i buy yankee candle because they have so many size options and the quality of their scents are just cleaner and better quality. i also suggest the scent ""autumn wreath"" as its the perfect clove spice apple mix for me and doesnt harm my sensitive nose."
1,17-Sep-20,5,"What else is there to say Yankee Candles are the BEST! No matter what I have spent on candles in my long life, Yankee candles are always the best candles anyone can buy anywhere. PERIOD!  Don't waste your money buying other brands..The scents are wonderful, they burn perfectly..(just be sure to trim the wicks) and they're well worth the money. I miss getting them by the case on holidays, but my husband no longer knows the owner of the company we shopped at in MA. I'd just be careful WHERE you buy them as some people, selling them, may have stale candles that lost their scent..Buy from Yankee candle itself..to get the best freshest candles."
1,6-Jan-19,1,"Poorly Designed Formulas - Won't Liquefy to Glass I'm giving up on Yankee candles. I thought I got a bad one or two, but they're all like that. They just don't burn to the glass, and you're left with a wax funnel.  You get a new one, make sure the wick is 1/8"", give it a light, and wait for four hours. It's not liquefied to the glass. Give it another four hours, and it still won't. And *another* four hours, and you've got a wax funnel. I've tried stopping trimming every four hours, but that doesn't help. I always end up babying it and holding a charcoal lighter to the glass and/or hard wax, and then using a plastic soon to cultivate the candle. It takes an entire tank of butane and then some.  I threw my last one out and swore them off in favor of Sonoma or Woodwick."
1,6-Aug-12,1,"melted all candles  2 of 3 arrived okay  but balsam fur cedar was all melted at the top.... no wick to burn from.... im serious... please send another...this isnt wright,,,  thank you  in this matter,,,,  Howard Shaw"
1,16-Jan-20,5,"""Pleasantly Scented and Not too Strong"" I couldn't resist purchasing this Yankee Balsam Cedar large sized candle at $11.00 with Amazon Prime free one day shipping.This is a pleasantly scented candle that I wanted to burn to complement my live Christmas tree.I've burned this candle between 5-6 hours daily and over a month later, the Balsam and Cedar blend is still pleasantly scenting my home.If you love fresh tree scents especially around the holidays, or like a fresh balsam scent year round as I do,you will fall in love with this Yankee candle scent."
1,7-Dec-15,2,"I have always loved Yankee candles and would always buy them when I ... I have always loved Yankee candles and would always buy them when I could afford to. When I do buy them I buy quite a few and spend quite a bit of money. But here lately I am very disappointed in the quality of their candles. The candles do not have the secent that  they once had. You can see the difference when burning the candles. There is no where as much oil in them that there use to be and this is very obvious by the scent as well as the colors turn after burning the candles. I am not satisfied at all with the quality of Yankee candles product here lately. I did purchase a candle from my local grocery store recently which was a quater of the price of a yankee candle and it gave off a much more detectable scent for a longer period of time. It is definitely time for me to reconsider spending so much on a product whose quality has tremendously went down. I hope to find a candle that will make my house feel like home, and leave a nice, long lasting scent."
1,25-Feb-20,1,scent has gone way down I have been a Yankee customer for 20 years...Over the past 2 years I didn't want to think I was right but unfortunately I am. I just spent 120.00 on large jar candles during one of their sales. I don't know if they hold these sales to get rid of old candles or what but I always order sage and citrus as well as lemon lavender. My sage and citrus is giving off no scent at all. I almost feel betrayed by a New England company. I have been faithful for many years and now I feel like I've been ripped off...Its sad really...29.50 for candles that have no scent...Yankee Candle you have lost a loyal customer
1,9-Jan-19,4,"Great size, but virtually NO aroma/scent! Nice big candle, bought for gift. Mom says she wanted a candle so I thought the size was nice and big so it'd last all through the holidays. It was delivered perfectly, on time, just one complaint. And for me it was a biggie: barely scented! Funny, I almost didn't get it because normally Yankee candles are way too strong. But wow, after several hours, even then only a faint aroma. So it gave light, but I could barely detect an aroma. And I have a sensitive nose do usually I smell to much scent. I'm really bummed because it did smell like a cookie but JUST barely."
1,2-Nov-14,1,"I spend hundreds of dollars a year on Yankee Candles and have always loved your product I am an avid buyer of Yankee Candles and have noticed the quality of your candles has considerably declined.  They do not have the scent that they once had and you can see the difference when the candle is burning.  There is not as much oil in the candle and this is obvious by the scent as well as the colors the candles turn after they have been burning.  I spend hundreds of dollars a year on Yankee Candles and have always loved your product; however, when I purchased a Wal-Mart ""Better Homes and Garden"" candle for a quarter of the price and the scent was more detectable for a longer period of time, it is time for me to reconsider my purchasing of your product.  I would like to see the ""Old Yankee Candles"" that really made your house feel like a home when they were burning be manufactured once agai .  I want my love for ""Yankee Candle"" back."
1,19-Feb-20,5,"Yankee Candles smell great and provide Safety I love Yankee Candles for all the traditional reasons; they smell great and are long lasting. It wasn't until recently I discovered they have a hidden safety feature. MY boyfriend found himself throwing a tantrum and getting quite aggressive reverting back to a toddler state where you feel the need use your hands unnecessarily. I picked up my large clean cotton Yankee Candle and hurled it at his head. He went down then came back up dazed and retreated. It wasn't until I picked my Yankee Candle back up I realized it didn't even crack despite hitting a LARGE cranium and falling to the hard floor. I will now make sure to have a large Yankee Candle in every room because their fragrance mixed with the scent of ""You Tried It"" smells so much sweeter. Even the display gives, ""Remember what I am capable of"" vibes Highly Recommend."
1,24-Oct-20,5,"Great smelly wax! Strong but not overpowering scent of balsam and cedar.  Long lasting in elegant and understated tall glass container with cover.  Very nice.  Although a tad pricier than some candles, it is worth it.  A great gift - won't put you in the poor house but says you choose your gifts with care."
1,16-Dec-19,5,Balsam & Cedar perfect for Christmas! First time buying this wonderful scent to have burning at this time of year! Yankee Candles never disappoint. The color & presentation of the candle is Winter like. It was package securely & has burned evenly. For as much as I‚Äôve had it lit there is so much more left that last through Christmas & beyond. Highly recommend!
1,3-Sep-17,2,"TOTALLY MELTED UPON ARRIVAL This is one of my favorite candles by Yankee Candle. It smells wonderfully like pine. The one I ordered through Amazon is just as great EXCEPT it was completely melted and had spilled out of the box. It was in a separate box and in styrofoam but still totally melted. I would NOT recommend buying this through Amazon or through the mail. I was luckily able to take a knife to get to the wick. Once I started burning it, it kind of melted back to the way it should be but that's not really acceptable. Good candle, DON'T BUY ONLINE!"
1,13-Aug-20,1,"No throw whatsoever Unfortunately there was no throw to this scent at all. I was hoping for the same level of balsam scent as another popular brand that I won't name, but I'm sure you know it's retail locations. Pass this one and just go for something else. Was hoping to love it, but didn't live up to any expectations."
1,1-Jan-08,4,"Good Christmas Scent In all fairness, I must give an update.  Thought I'd take a chance and buy another Mistletoe candle today (October 24, 2013).  The scent seems to be a good deal stronger than the one I bought previously in 2008.Nice and sweet scent similar to a Christmas tree - dare say it's one of the closest to a Christmas Tree that Yankee Candle has.  My wife likes the candle, so it must be good!Upgrade to a four star - recommended.Earlier review:While other reveiwers have given this candle a 5-star rating, I have to give it a 3 mainly because the scent was too weak for me.  Personally, I like candles to pack some ""punch"" when they burn and Mistletoe, while a pleasant smelling candle, is not as strong as some of the other Yankee candle scents.The candle smells good while in the store and does smell okay when burning, but the scent is just a little too weak for me.  The scent is definitely piney, but could have been stronger (in my humble opinion).If you like a candle with a subtle piney scent, then this one's for you.  Otherwise, get another scent if you like something stronger."
1,21-May-19,3,"Follow instructions! Love the scent! It‚Äôs nostalgic and seasonal, however if someone puts the wick out too early the candle longevity severely decreases so be careful and be sure to burn long enough each time!"
1,5-Jan-13,3,"love the smell, hate the soot I LOVE Yankee Candles.  I've used them exclusively for 20 years now.  And I still love them, but I won't be buying any large tumbler candles in the near future.  I've always used the jars, but this year I got a couple of tumblers.  They burned very smokey and left a lot of unsightly soot along the inside of the glass.  They look terrible and cheap.  They do smell good, though, so we're going to live with the ugliness until they're gone (which is very soon!)but that will be it.  I'm going back to jars until Yankee lets me know that they've changed the way the tumblers are manufactured."
1,13-Apr-19,5,"Strong cherry aroma, worth the money. I was skeptical about this scent when I bought it in a Yankee Candle store. Thought it would make my house smell like cherry cough syrup. To my surprise it didn‚Äôt! Would purchase again. Cherry scent was on the stronger side which I liked so I felt I got my money‚Äôs worth on this candle."
1,21-Sep-20,5,"AWESOME I have bought this scent from the yankee store and its by far my fav. I would buy this scent for everything, home and car!  I find it covers the dog ‚Äúscent‚Äù. Yankee should never ever stop making this scent!!!!!!!!"
1,1-Dec-19,3,"Down-scaled! I love this candle scent. It is authentic pine and does not smell like room spray. BUT it used to come in a pretty glass jar that was elegant and rounded near the top. Before that is was even nicer and had a frosted look to the jar. Now the glass jar has been cheapened to be just a plain, common candle jar. I wish the company would come back with the more upscale look."
1,26-Dec-19,1,"Pure Junk It doesn't smell at all while burning. Extremely disappointed and a big waste of money.You would have better luck burning a dollar store candle, compared to this junk"
1,23-Jan-10,5,"Holiday Bayberry Yankee Candle Holiday Bayberry is a good candle for the person looking for a good Christmas time scent.  The description says the main scents are:  pine, fir, laurel, bayberry, frankincense, and myrrh.  The scents blend together smoothly and results in a nice piney scent.  Great Christmas time scent, especially with the frankincense and myrrh (According to the Bible, the wise men gave these and gold as gifts to the young Jesus Christ, hence the appeal to Christians).Great strong scent that is probably best used during the fall and winter.Highly recommended!"
1,5-Dec-18,5,"Intoxicating I love this candle. It reminds me of where my family is from, Maine, and the smell is intoxicating. For me it‚Äôs almost like aromatherapy, since tree smells are soothing to me. I always have one going while doing homework or even just wanting to relax, to help me focus and not get stressed out. This candle is the BEST candle from yankee candle. (pink sands is nice too though)."
1,16-Nov-16,5,"Finally a good pine scent. Yankee candle never seems to fail. I have always had a hard time finding a pine scented candle that doesn't make your head feel ten times larger than it should be after smelling it for a few minutes. This candle reminds me so much of the cool, dew laden mornings when I would camp up in the sierras and I have always wanted that fresh forest air smell in my house. Yankee scents are potent so I would suggest using this candle in a larger room or an open room such as a living room or kitchen where it can waft around your house and not get trapped and overbearing. This scent would be a perfect addition to your home as you put up your holiday decor and get into the wonderful holiday spirit, and adds a fresh liveliness to a room that has a fake christmas tree in it. For anyone who has been looking for that perfect pine mountain scent, this is the one."
1,17-Dec-16,2,"might as well bought a cheap generic candle(would not because I don't like them), you can barely if at all smell ... Every year I buy Yankee Candles from the Yankee Candle store.  I also give them as gifts at Thanksgiving to start off the holiday season.  I have been willing to pay the high price for the candles because of their scent. I am very unhappy with my Christmas Cookie candles this year, might as well bought a cheap generic candle(would not because I don't like them), you can barely if at all smell the scent....I have a pretty good nose and no cold....will never buy Yankee Candles again.  This makes me sad because it was something I always looked forward to at Christmas. Sadly it seems that Yankee Candles has joined the Greed Makes the World go Round people."
1,8-Dec-06,5,"The Scent of Christmas! I'm a huge fan of Yankee Candle, especially their Housewarmer line.  I'm also a huge fan of the Christmas season, so what a combo!  The Mistletoe scent brings to mind a slightly semi-sweet yet refreshing Christmas greenery and pine boughs combination.  Very ""Christmasy"", not overpowering!I make sure to stock up on these for Christmastime, and I give smaller jars as gifts to friends.I have tried many other brands of candles meant to scent up whole rooms, and none come close to Yankee Candle in quality.  I have a very sensitive sense of smell, and most other brands are either too weak, or are so overpowering as to make one nauseous!Yankee Candle gets it ""just right"" every time.  For Christmastime you can't beat the scent of Yankee Candle's Mistletoe!"
1,5-Nov-17,5,"Lovely tree smell I love realistic tree smells. I have this one, Balsam and Cedar, and Sparkling Pine. The Mistletoe is my favorite. It has a very woodsy smell to it, and not an entirely cold smell like Sparkling Pine. PS my candle is much more green than the picture here. I bought it at the Yankee Candle store in the mall, not on Amazon."
1,14-Jul-10,4,"Best smelling candle in the Yankee Candles line This is the only candle I've ever found that really, genuinely smells like Christmas.  Fresh-cut spruce and pine, crisp and clean, smells completely natural.  Just opening the jar is like getting a smell of Christmas.  This is absolutely the best pine scented candle I've ever found and by far the best in the Yankee candle line.  There's a reason this scent always seems to sell out first in the shops!  The only reason I haven't given this 5 stars is that I do think it's a bit overpriced.  But there's really no other candle that can compare to this smell."
1,4-Sep-17,3,"Not the quality they used to be... For years Yankee candles were my vice. A little pricey, but worth the extra cost with their fresh, long-lasting scent. A few years ago, after the original company was bought out, something changed in their formula or their process. The candles still have a wonderful scent, but the ones I own, Balsam and Cedar and Green Grass, are so faint that the scent only throws a few feet from the candle, and that after burning for an hour or more. Burning for an entire day won't even scent the whole room. Such a disappointment."
1,24-Apr-19,5,Easy on the Nose and allergies I have a horrible time with candles and scents and the headaches they give me... I tend to stick to more neutral scents like vanilla.  This one is great!
1,19-Dec-19,5,Nice I got it for $15.00 which is very reasonable.The price is usually $20.00 (too expensive)!!
1,26-Apr-19,3,Great candle but smell is changing The balsam smell is getting more perfume like than pine like it used to be.
1,9-Nov-17,1,"When my tree went up I would enjoy the scent that was so much like a real ... Over the years I've purchased many Yankee ""Christmas Wreath"" scented candles. When my tree went up I would enjoy the scent that was so much like a real Christmas tree. My son just got one for his girlfriend because he too remembers the fragrance of Christmas. When I smelled the candle he'd gotten from Amazon, there was no hint of the""Christmas Wreath"" I remember. Everything in the stores seem to be shrinking and the quality isn't the same. Is this another example. Very disappointed."
1,30-Nov-07,1,"Customer Service This review is not for the candle itself, which is amazing, although overpriced. It is for Yankee Candle's extremely poor customer service. They took over 3 weeks to ship my order, and when I called and sent emails, they were rude and unhelpful. They didn't answer my questions or adequately address my concerns. They said they would refund my shipping cost, but haven't as of yet, after numerous calls and emails. Several times I tried to call and couldn't even get through- got a busy signal or a recording saying the wait would be over 30 minutes!! So I actually had to call a different department and talk to someone who didn't know anything about their shipping/customer service policies. Ridiculous! I will never order from them again, which is a real shame, since I love their candles!"
1,30-Jan-11,5,"Perfect for the holiday season For some reason I was given this candle as a gift one christmas. I thought it was perhaps because my apartment smelled? Regardless, I am hooked now.First off the glass jar is aesthetically pleasing with most any decor. The front label does not come off easily, but it's a Yankee Candle so most people like to leave it on. The lid is also glass with a rubber ring to seal the candle. It is easy to light and burns very evenly. I keep the wick trimmed usually. Occasionally I will put it on a candle warmer, and fits most that you can buy in stores/online.The smell at first can be a little overwhelming, but this will occur with any candle. However, over time it provides a nice light hint of pine and cedar, which I find quite relaxing. The smell is not heavy, but quite refreshing and can brighten up a room, especially during the winter/holiday months. Highly recommend to men/women or anyone looking for a good quality and valued pine scented candle."
1,1-Jan-08,5,"A Good, Strong Holiday Scent In my humble opinion, Holiday Bayberry is one of the better Yankee Candle holiday scents.  The candle is supposed to contain a hint of pine, fir, laurel, frankincense, and myrrh.  The blend is great and the scents complement one another, with pine appearing to be the dominant scent.If you are looking for a candle that is a bit different from the regular Christmas Tree scents, then this one's for you.  The scent is strong and unique.Recommended."
1,14-Apr-20,5,"Amazing smell Wonderful smell, not just for Xmas but year round"
1,17-Jan-16,1,"No smell......... Remember 10 years ago the smell (Balsam & Cedar) one of my favorite,fill up the whole house on Christmas time.Now the smell  and aroma gone...........10x10 room smell like lampblack.This is fakes?I am ashamed to give as gifts!Return the closest store."
1,11-May-20,5,Great candles Good quality candles
1,11-Dec-19,1,No smell. Cheaper alternatives for a candle that has no scent.
1,18-Nov-18,1,Beware-not the same one-knockoff? Not same label as the one pictured for sale.  Cheaper one on this site had this label. Thought I was buying better quality one but got the same one but way more expensive! Burned it for about two hours- no smell. Definitely a knockoff or Yankle has lost its quality.
1,24-Dec-19,5,It‚Äôs a wonderful candle I love this candle! Great scent & I highly recommend it!
1,14-Dec-14,2,Little Quality Control Issue! Once again I bought a few Yankee Candles from the Yankee Candle store and once again was disappointed. I purchased a Medium Cozy Cabin as it smelled great in the jar. At 33% burned the scent is gone and as usual the wick is not centered so one side of the wax isn't melting. This may seem trivial but for what I paid for these candles I am disappointed. I bought several candles much less expensive at another store that are no worse but has a centred wick. My expectations for the Yankee brand were set higher but are melting away.
1,7-Mar-20,5,Smells good Love the yankee candles
1,10-Dec-19,5,Festive scent Smells just like a fresh Christmas tree...
1,27-Dec-17,1,What happened to this wonderful candle? What happened to Yankee Candle? The last few I purchased had very little scent. Something has changed and they are not worth it any more. I have completely stopped buying that brand when there are so many brands that smell for a much longer time.
1,14-Nov-18,4,Broken Arrived and broken. Hate returning things so I smashed the rest of the glass and will use it. But still a P.I.A. Peace Bob
1,27-Oct-12,5,"The closest thing to the real tree aroma This review is only on the scent of the candle since I did not buy it from this seller. The aroma is the closest  one to a real tree's scent. I've also tried yankee candle's Balsam & Cedar, but Mistletoe smells more natural. Last year I bought Balsam and Cedar, but this year I'm going back to mistletoe. I highly recommend it!"
1,18-Oct-18,5,"love the smell great candle, my house smells so nice"
1,29-Dec-18,5,"Nice Scent, good value... Candle seemed like it had a weak scent, after a couple hours of burning it picked up the scent. Decent candle, nice scent."
1,4-Jan-19,5,A must have! I absolutely am in love with this candle. It smells exactly like Christmas cookies (believe me I'm a baker.) And the yummy smell takes over the room. I highly recommend it for Christmas or for any other day if you want the sweet smell of freshly baked goods.
1,21-Aug-14,1,Bet I'll love it. Have not tried the Balsam & Cedar yet.  Bet I'll love it.
1,3-Dec-18,5,Packaged Well Love that it came very securely packaged in its original shipping box from Yankee Candle. It‚Äôs perfect and smells wonderful!
1,3-Dec-16,5,Seasonal Candle is a must for decorating. I recently received this candle as a gift for the Christmas season since I am away from home. It smells like Christmas cookies but not in an overwhelming way. I prefer to light it when I'm decorating or having guests over.
1,18-Dec-19,5,Smells Amazing This candle smell so yummy it has a great throw too.
1,18-Dec-17,1,"So strong, I can taste it. :-( My husband loves this candle. The cedar/balsam scent is realistic and STRONG. It‚Äôs so strong, I can taste it. I can‚Äôt tolerate this candle. I‚Äôm bummed."
1,22-Jan-13,5,"Smells Like A Forest In Winter They could have also named this candle ""Mountain Cabin."" It makes my place near the beach smell like Mammoth Mountain during ski season. It's perfect for winter. The other reviewer was right about the fragrance lasting all the way to the bottom of the jar. This candle smells so ""real"" and natural. I don't know how Yankee Candle does it, but I'm glad they know how."
1,26-Nov-06,5,"Christmas Wreath candle When you first open this candle, you get a distinct smell of fresh cut pine boughs. When I first experienced this candle, I was looking all over for the pine tree or pine decorations. It really smells like a fresh Christmas wreath and it's worth every penny. Now I don't have to buy evergreen boughs for my home just to get the Christmas tree smell."
1,13-Dec-17,5,Absolutely the best scent!!! Was told White Christmas was going to be retired. All of you who love it as much as I do need to express it to Yankee Candle. I love this year around!
1,16-Dec-07,5,"Very festive! We just purchased this candle at Bed Bath and Beyond with a coupon not truly knowing what to expect. This candle filled the house with a festive scent that gave you a wonderful holiday feel. We didn't get a tree this year, but it sure smells like we did! We plan on stocking up on this scent and planning on trying other scents by this company since this was our first Yankee Candle purchase. I would definitely give this candle as a gift. :)"
1,15-Apr-18,5,Smells like cookies Yankee candles are the best smelling around. This was a great price for great quality...and is one of my favorite scents.
1,27-Sep-19,1,Fake or old product Fake or old product
1,2-Dec-18,5,Yankee Candle Christmas Scent Great scent for the holidays. Great price and fast shipping
1,10-Dec-16,1,"Don't buy!!! I just bought FOUR holiday scented Yankee candles and can't smell a damn thing from any of them unless I put my nose so close to the flame that I would burn it off.  Yankee Candles is ripping people off with their falsely advertised ""scented"" candles, and as a candle connoisseur, I'm offended by it.  If you are going to pay for overpriced candles, at least buy the Bath & Body works ones, which actually emit a fragrance through your home!"
1,23-Jan-10,4,"Red Apple Wreath The Red Apple Wreath scents are supposed to be composed of cinnamon, red apples, maple, and walnut.  The cinnamon and red apples appear to be the strongest.  In my humble opinion, while the candle can be used year-round, the scent is most appropriate for the fall and winter.  A pretty good scent from Yankee Candle.  If you like red apples and cinnamon, then this candle is for you.Recommended."
1,25-Dec-19,1,Late and All Broken! The candle arrived late and it was broken badly. I‚Äôve had trouble with Yankee candle so just would like a credit please!  Thank you!imagejpeg_0.jpg
1,8-Jan-19,5,The Best. In my opinion the best candle there is.
1,12-Jan-19,5,Good scent Terrific product. Excellent scent
1,24-Jan-19,5,Still burning! Bought months ago ?üòã Makes me hungry for desserts
1,20-Nov-19,5,Candle is amazing Smells good
1,29-Dec-19,5,Good product Wife loves the scent
1,3-Dec-18,4,lovely scent lasts longer than most. Good product
1,3-Dec-17,5,Super invincible.  Worthwhile Love this logistics The best seller. Bit too tense...  so far! I used it and looked very durable. Lying on the couch and need it
1,26-Nov-19,5,The warmth the scent brings to your home. I have been using Cedar and Balsam by Yankee in all sizes and ways for many years. I continue to reload my own personal stock for Christmas.. I don't want to run out of this delightful scent at this time of year. I love it.
1,2-Feb-19,5,i can order it on line. love candle

1,10-Jan-18,5,"Smells ahhhmazing I have it burning in a frying pan on my radiator.Smells a whole lot better than car wash pine trees tied to a fan! Smiles. Great job, Yankee Candles!! Arrived snug as a bug. Thanks for a great product!! I ordered two more"
1,24-Sep-18,5,Smells amazing It smells amazing and gives off a cozy feeling
1,20-Oct-18,5,Christmas in a jar Absolute favorite Christmas candle.
1,29-Feb-16,5,"Amazing This smells amazing!  I got this as a dirty Santa gift and I love it.  I know it's supposed to be a holiday scent, but I'm using it in March!! I just love the smell."
1,21-Mar-20,1,"Don‚Äôt even smell Not smell , not worthy the money"
1,25-Jun-17,5,Five Stars My favorite post-Christmas winter scent!
1,5-Jan-13,5,Warm vanilla like fragrance... I kept the wick trimmed short and burned it for several hours the first time. The double wick helps it burn evenly. Wonderful throw. Seems to appeal to most people. My new favorite. Would make a great year round kitchen candle.
1,28-Jan-20,5,Smells just like fresh cookies! This is my favorite Christmas candle of all time.
1,21-Dec-19,3,"Great deal I got a great deal on this, but the candle's scent didnt seem as strong as I would like."
1,12-Dec-18,3,Consider alternate options. I received as a gift and the smell is there it is just not strong enough for a house sized space. I recommend the Frazier Fir candle for a great strong scent.
1,9-Sep-14,4,"Love it! This came in perfect condition - love the scent!! I only knocked one star off b/c it came in a jar and not a tumbler, so there's that to be aware of. No biggie to me but might be to someone else!"
1,7-Mar-10,5,"Smells like the ""bagged"" Christmas sugar cookies from the  80's! I don't know if you can buy those cookies anymore, but that is what this candle reminds me of. Remember the Christmas sugar cookies in the 80's (and before I am sure) that came in the bag with the sprinkles?  That is what this one reminds me of! Everytime I smell this candle I am taken back to the Christmases of my childhood.  If you like sugar cookies, you'll love this candle!"
1,19-Nov-16,5,"Wonderful fragrance! I love this scent, I can smell this throughout my condo. I plan on getting more."
1,19-Nov-08,5,"Smells Just Like Church! Yankee Candle's Holiday Bayberry is my very favorite candle at the Christmas season and guaranteed to put anyone in a holiday mood.  The unique scent reminds me of the incense used at church on high holy days.  This candle is discontinued, but can be found on line during the holidays.  My kids even love it!"
1,7-Jan-15,5,"A Yankee Candle Classic This is a classic candle during the Holiday season. This has a pretty strong smell, reminds me of a fresh cut Christmas tree, a very fresh scent. I buy two every year."
1,30-Dec-19,5,Candle burned away too fast!?üò? Love it!
1,17-Dec-17,5,Five Stars Received it. Thank you! Xmas gift.
1,22-Dec-15,2,"Christmas Wreath. Candle has been burning for several hours today.  I have yet to smell the scent.  I burned it yesterday, same thing.  No smell."
1,23-Nov-20,4,Great Candle Love the smell
1,26-Dec-18,5,"Smells great As always, yankee candle delivers a great candle."
1,30-Jul-20,5,As Described. Smells exactly as described and is a nice size.
1,30-Nov-07,1,"Customer service This review is not for the candle itself, which is amazing, although overpriced.  It is for Yankee Candle's extremely poor customer service.  They took over 3 weeks to ship my order, and when I called and sent emails, they were rude and unhelpful.  They didn't answer my questions or adequately address my concerns.  They said they would refund my shipping cost, but haven't as of yet, after numerous calls and emails.  Several times I tried to call and couldn't even get through- got a busy signal or a recording saying the wait would be over 30 minutes!!  So I actually had to call a different department and talk to someone who didn't know anything about their shipping/customer service policies.  Ridiculous!  I will never order from them again, which is a real shame, since I love their candles!"
1,24-Jul-14,1,I use to be the biggest fan and the scent was wonderful and filled the room Yankee Candle has changed so much since I first purchased.  I use to be the biggest fan and the scent was wonderful and filled the room.  Now you have to be within 3 feet to even get a whiff.  I quit buying a couple of years ago and buy the tea lights (which use to be wonderful in a bedroom) once a year to see if they have improved.  So sad.
1,29-Dec-19,5,Love it! Love it! This candle brought the fragrance of a Christmas tree to my home!
1,8-Nov-15,5,It arrived in perfect condition and she loves it This was a gift for my daughter. It arrived in perfect condition and she loves it!

1,8-Jan-19,5,Great price Great price  . This was a gift for someone
1,3-Oct-14,4,... more than what it was but I did it enjoy it. I had hoped the aroma would have been just a little more than what it was but I did it enjoy it.
1,4-May-15,5,Awesome delivery Purchased on a Thursday and was delivered on Saturday of the SAME WEEK!  Very impressed!
1,19-Mar-17,5,Five Stars Smell my whole house up sooo good?üíñ
1,6-Nov-17,5,Great candle Bought the single wick 16 oz at Marshall‚Äôs for 7.99 today.
1,14-Nov-10,5,"Perfect Christmas Smell! I love this candle so much! I couldn't choose between this candle or the Yankee Candle Mistletoe scent.  But, I realize that this scent is perfect because it smells like cinnamon, mistletoe, and other great smells.  I definitely reccomend this to anyone! Not too overwhelming at all."
1,12-Nov-16,5,"Yankee Candle Christmas Cookies I love this candle it reminds me of my childhood baking sugar cookies at Christmas time,in fact I keep a nice supply of this candle for all seasons.When it gets really hot in July I run the AC and burn this Candle in my room and start counting down to Christmas."
1,2-Dec-05,5,"Yankee candles are great! I just purchased several of these candles today in a votive size.  They have a wonderful scent, very Christmas like and it is not overwhelming at all."
1,2-May-14,5,Five Stars Yankee candles are always nice and used this for a most-appreciated gift.
1,20-Dec-17,5,My favorite Christmas candle! Christmas Wreath is my favorite Christmas candle. It smells like a Christmas tree. I highly recommend this product.
1,16-Dec-19,5,"It makes a great gift. Great scent, makes a perfect gift for Christmas."
1,2-Feb-16,5,Five Stars favorite fragrance
1,7-Dec-15,5,Yankee Candle Arrived on time.  Great Yankee Candle Scent!!
1,18-Dec-17,1,Has only 1 wick. Does not give off nearly ... Has only 1 wick. Does not give off nearly the same scent as Yankee Candle's 2 wick scent. I am wondering if these candles are knockoffs.
1,31-Dec-14,5,Five Stars Smells amazing and it burns all the wax not just what's close to the fire. Leave no residue
1,29-Dec-17,5,Great job!! Great!!
1,5-Jan-17,5,"Exellent! What is not to like about Yankee Candles?Great product, can't be beet!I've had many candles and nothing comes close to Yankee candles for their fragrance and burning hours.."
1,6-Feb-19,5,Yankee candles are the best Really like the scent that permeates my whole house without being overpowering
1,12-Dec-09,5,excellent Very pleased - the subtle scent fills the room very smoothly. I think its a little pricey but I had some less pricey ones before and I will buy yankee anytime over the other ones
1,22-Jan-17,1,Not a great smell Smells like robitussin medicine when lit.
1,9-Feb-17,5,Christmas Eve This is one of my favorite candles. I t smells like candied fruit. Very nice for Christmas. And I love the label.
1,8-Dec-16,1,"Pretty much a huge waste of my time Product was shattered when received. I'm not taking another chance that the replacement will show up not damaged, so taking a refund. Pretty much a huge waste of my time."
1,24-Jan-17,5,Five Stars Christmas Wreath is my favorite Yankee Candle so I bought several!
1,30-Jan-16,1,"Poor quality. Did not burn evenly Poor quality. Did not burn evenly. Wrote to company Yankee Candle and told them where I purchased (Kohl's). They refused to replace stating I needed a receipt. How cheap is that, especially for what you pay for these things. See the pictures. Way to treat your customers Yankee Candle!"
1,23-Dec-16,5,"Five Stars Purchased as a gift, receiver was pleased"
1,6-Jan-17,3,Three Stars Not as strong of a smell as I hoped
1,8-Dec-14,5,"Gingerbread in a Jar! One of the most delightful holiday candles I have ever used!  The flavor I can mostly strongly identify is gingerbread and the scent really gets into the air.  We use from November through the winter to give our home a warm, welcoming smell."
1,15-Jan-13,5,awesome My friend loved her candle! She said the smell was amazing. It was an easy and simply perfect gift. I recomend this candle..  yankee is awesome.
1,8-Jun-09,2,It's OK The smell of the candle itself is fantastic however it is not a strong smell.  We had ours lit for 3 hours and could barley smell anything.
1,26-Jun-14,2,"Leaked The wax was leaked all over the packaging, it almost half gone, the bottle is not sealed.... so so sad..."
1,17-Jan-16,1,A complete waste of time and money The candle was a gift and it arrived smashed! A complete waste of time and money... not to mention the embarrassment.
1,14-Jan-11,1,Too expensive I am buying these candles for 9.99 or less in Marshalls. I buy other articles in Amazon but this is one item too expensive to buy here
1,25-Apr-20,3,"Glade scents actually better than this Yankee for less $ I suppose I have been spoiled by other balsam and cedar candles so I was a little disappointed in the scent of this Yankee Candle candle. I‚Äôve always heard they are supposed to be excellent candles but I wasn‚Äôt wowed by it. It was nice enough. The scent was okay. But I wasn‚Äôt super happy with it either. So that‚Äôs why the middle of the road 3 stars‚Äînot wowed; it was okay; nice enough scent but wish it had been a bit stronger; wish the candle had lasted longer.I‚Äôm still looking for scents like the candles I bought from restoration hardware stores‚Äîtheir balsam/cedar candles were absolutely wonderful and I can‚Äôt find those any more‚Äîpity, as they were my favorites. As well, Rugged & Dapper balsam candle is one of the best scents and the glass is beautiful‚ÄîI bought one of those for my guy and he loved it; I wanted one for myself but they sold out quick at Christmastime!This Yankee Candle balsam candle didn‚Äôt last long. The scent is nice but not quite strong enough. And the glass jars/pillars they come in aren‚Äôt ones I really care to leave out to display‚Äîthough this pillar was a nicer than the design  I bought for a friend.For the scent comparison with Yankee, I‚Äôd rather pay far less and buy Glade, as those scents are just as good as this Yankee Candle Balsam candle for a fraction of the cost. Or, spend a bit more and buy the ones I really enjoy.Thank you for reading my review."
1,4-Dec-16,1,"I absolutely love these candles and would burn this scent all year ... I absolutely love these candles and would burn this scent all year round but the two I just recently received don't smell at all when lit! An absolute waste of money if you ask me, and that's a shame because they are pretty expensive candles... ?üëé?üèº"
1,16-Feb-20,4,"Not as quality as Rugged & Dapper! But the scent is foresty and the price is right Update: this candle is twice the size of the Rugged & Dapper, so it's the better buy, really. And my guy says it smells great so I purchased the pillar candle in the balsam & cedar scent and it was on sale for less than $17‚ÄîI like the pillar better than the old-fashioned jar his came in. The scent is strong but not overwhelmingly strong: I like it. It‚Äôs not the best balsam & cedar candle I‚Äôve ever had but it smells good and provides a nice forest scent to the room.-----I bought my guy this Yankee Candle balsam and cedar candle because the one I really wanted was sold out. Rugged & Dapper makes the best forest-scented candle I‚Äôve ever smelled and he loved it and used the entire candle‚Äîand the Rugged & Dapper glass jar the candle is in is attractive. This was an in-a-hurry impulse buy when R&D was sold out, though I don‚Äôt like the presentation of this Yankee Candle with the old-fashioned jar look; however, balsam & cedar candles are difficult to find.I don‚Äôt like this jar‚ÄîI wish Yankee Candle did something better with their balsam & cedar scent instead of this old-fashioned jar look. It looks cheap and like something I‚Äôd buy at Big Lots. That‚Äôs my one disappointment.(Update: I purchased the pillar candle for myself and it is more to my liking than the jar.)As far as the scent, it smells really good! Not quite as good as the Rugged & Dapper candle in the same scent, but the scent is strong enough to permeate the room and give that Christmas-at-time-of-the-year scent. Though Rugged & Dapper edges out Yankee Candle in scent, too.For the money, this is a lot of candle‚Äîboth the jar and the pillar I later bought‚Äîand will last a long time, and it smells good."
1,28-Jan-18,1,"Very Disappointed Purchase (2) of the Balsam and  cedar candles and they arrived today. They were expensive,  but I counted on the Yankee Candle name to deliver as it always has in the past. The scent can only be smelled if I stand directly In  front of it. I was so excited happily waiting for them to arrive. I can only say this purchase will never be made again. I purchase Yankee candles  all the time and never had this problem: they must be old.One star was given for the scent I ordered , which, I love;  however this scent is mere wax burning -  nothing more."
1,1-Dec-18,1,"What has happened to Yankee Candle? I used to purchase only Yankee Candles as they were the best ones ever. After a move, the only local option became Bath and Bodyworks so I tried those and they were wonderful too. This week, I decided to order a couple of homey type Yankee Candles that I had loved in years past: French Vanilla and a Cookie flavored one. They arrived today and neither of them have hardly any scent when you sniff them cold. I figured once lit things would get better. Nope. I have one of each of the ones I bought burning in a different part of the house and you'd never know there was a scented candle lit.Seems every company that puts out a product that is wonderful, decides at some point to go cheap and ruin it. I won't buy this brand again. BBW candles are amazing and have wonderful throws."
1,25-Nov-20,1,"DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY.  NO SCENT AT ALL For a Yankee Candle, and the price I paid, I was very disappointed. The smell was non-existent. I thought Yankee were once the best? Apparently greed must have killed them like it does so many businesses these days. You get people running the biz that want to start using cheaper quality materials to make more profit, and they raise prices to ridiculous levels because people love their products. Only they don‚Äôt realize people aren‚Äôt as stupid as they hoped. The people begin to realize that they just aren‚Äôt as good as they once were and they are WAY out of the ballpark now for the Quality to Cost ratio. So people try another brand and go wow, that‚Äôs a great candle! And they never go back. They then talk to their friends about it and the friends ‚Äúwake up‚Äù and go ‚Äúyour right, their candles just aren‚Äôt that great anymore. Their prices have gotten ridiculous anyway.‚Äù It is now that they switch too over to that other brand that really knows how to make a great smelling candle, that stays smelling great, until the last bit of life leaves the flame on the wicks.I know for a fact that this happens as stated above. It is from direct experiences on my part, multiple times as well. I even started polling our friends and the majority of them actually verified the same sentiment. That Yankee Candles, which used to be everyone‚Äôs favorite, have gone downhill so badly and have gotten so crazy expensive, that it just does not make sense to keep wasting the amount of time I have to work to pay for them. I work hard. I want quality for my money and time. I‚Äôm not going to spend an hour working to throw away on garbage. Companies don‚Äôt respect the people who work to pay their salaries. The only thing they care about is my money and not the time I slaved at work just to purchase their crappy product. What happened to the days when ‚Äúcustomers come FIRST‚Äù? They‚Äôre gone and now it‚Äôs only about taking your money/time and passing it on to the fat executive that‚Äôs destroying their brand, just to make themselves and their greedy shareholders fatter and richer off the backs of those who do the REAL work in this world.... just for the privilege of buying their overpriced trinkets."
1,4-Dec-19,1,"Disappointed...these Mistletoe candles from Amazon were not up to usual YC quality. Very disappointed.  This double wick tumbler in the Mistletoe scent is literally the only scented candles I purchase. I KNOW how they should perform. With these the scent was minimal to non-existent and the flame was dull.  So I just bought some directly from Yankee Candle. They arrived today. The house is filled with the fragrance, and they‚Äôre burning bright and clear...the way they should. Don‚Äôt know if the candles they sent from Amazon were stale or what, but I won‚Äôt buy any more thru Amazon, and I can‚Äôt recommend them to anyone else because they performed so poorly. Sorry. I don‚Äôt like writing negative reviews, but these buggers are expensive, and I‚Äôd hate to see others waste $$$ on them as I did."
1,27-Dec-19,5,"SO happy with this candle! Real Yankee Candle. Mistletoe scent. I have had a Yankee Candle Mistletoe candle for nearly 7 years now. I have only lit it here and there during the month of December. I finally ran out of the candle and ordered a new one here on Amazon. At first I chickened out after reading some poor reviews of people having suspicions it's not real or that they're ""old"" with no scent (I don't think age stops these candles from having a scent... I have several very old Yankee Candle candles that smell the same in all this time) and I cancelled my order. But then I decided to just go for it, ordered it again and it arrived today. It smells EXACTLY THE SAME as my Mistletoe Yankee Candle that I've had for years. It's not even fully melted the top and the scent has begun filling the room. So happy, wish I bought it sooner."
1,12-Feb-17,5,"It's hot in Texas but it feels like Christmas with this candle! I absolutely LOVE this candle scent! I don't normally spend more than a few dollars on candles but I can totally justify this Yankee Candle purchase because the smell is so comforting and actually smells like sugar cookies baking. Perfect for relaxing while studying. The scent is worth the cost. I also noticed that the candle lasts a really long time compared to my bath and body works candles. The scent is strong enough to make my boyfriend believe I was baking cookies (lol), needless to say its a must! It's so hot in Texas year 'round practically but this candle makes it feel like Christmas!This came in a yankee candle branded box and was packaged with styrofoam and arrived on time. Great for gifting.Suggestion: go for it! you won't regret it if you love warm/gourmet scents!*I will be buying more to stock up because this is my favorite scent yet!"
1,30-Nov-19,5,"Highly Disappointed in the Scent! While I like the size, I am totally disappointed in the scent. I specifically bought this for Christmas and the Balsam Cedar Scent. I love those smells and expected my home to smell all cedary like a forest.I don't get any of that. When I buy citrus scented candles, I smell it right away. I have burned this candle for three hours now. I smell something, but not cedar.So, I am not very content with my purchase. I expected way more from the reviews and the company statement.I am giving a one star review due to my huge disappointment.I am sorry. I rarely give a one star review. If the seller gets back to me in a positive way I will alter my review. But for the moment I stand by my statement as fair and honest."
1,9-Dec-19,5,STILL the BEST‚ù£Ô?è There is absolutely nothing better than a Balsam & Cedar Yankee Candle anytime of the year...but it‚Äôs especially amazing during the Christmas holidays‚ù£Ô?è I am not allowed to have a real tree in my apartment complex (independent senior living)...so I light this candle every evening to fill my apartment with the wonderful smell of pine ?üå?
1,6-Dec-18,5,"NOW it's Christmas!! I have tried numerous candles searching for that  ""Christmas Tree""  scent, and have always been disappointed.  I found these "" Mistletoe"" candles on Amazon for a fantastic price and ordered 2.  I don't really do Christmas , but I do put up a little artificial tree but missed the tree scent. NO MORE!!!  Where I have the candles sitting is close to the HVAC units intake , and WOW,  when my heater kicks on it pulls the scent up through the system and makes my whole house smell like Christmas.  I WILL be buying more of these.  I think when people say a candle has NO throw they should place the candles close to the air intake of their HVAC unit. Remember heat rises and takes scent with it."
1,25-Oct-19,5,really smells like cookies By far the best scented candle you can buy. It truly smells like Christmas cookies. When you first take off that lid the scent is so strong and amazing. This candle last a long time and really fills my studio apartment which is about 350 square feet if I keep it long enough my entire apartment can smell like cookies. Love it love it love it.
1,18-Dec-17,2,"Not the YC I know and love... My absolute favorite scent from Yankee Candle but...living in MA, I can drive to YC and select my own (or make my own). Having found 'my' scent on Amazon at a discounted price by almost $8/jar candle, I bought 2 for the holidays. Extremely disappointed: hardly any scent unless I stick my nose into the unlit candle, the wicks are not centered on either one so they burn crooked and the wax pools so badly because of the crooked wick that even with rotating the candle countless times during the burning hours, it extinguishes the wick time and time again and still forms that carbon ball at the top of the wick. That causes a very high flame when next ignited so trimming is necessary. Just a huge disappointment. I'll burn them because returning them would cost more than the candles cost me initially, but never again. I'll stick to paying a little more for a much higher quality candle from Yankee Candle direct."
1,10-Jan-18,5,"Scent Says, ""Welcome to My Home"" Who doesn't love Yankee Candles? No one I know. I would be hard pressed to name my #2 favorite fragrance, for there are several, depending on the season. But Sparkling Snow is my all-time, all-year favorite. When I was teaching, my classroom was three-quarters of the way down a long hall.  I would arrive early every morning, and part of my routine was to light my S'Snow candle. By the time the students and other faculty members arrived, the hall smelled like new-fallen snow in a piney woods. Many commented on how much they liked it, even the students. It's a fresh, clean fragrance--not overwhelming like some strong pine cleaner at all. I also appreciated that it lasted a very long time, and would last even longer on a candle warmer. I was sad when the scent was discontinued for a few years and rejoiced to see it available again."
1,11-Mar-17,1,"So disappointed...absolutely NO scent!!! I have been a satisfied Yankee Candle customer for YEARS, and usually purchase either the Balsam and Cedar or Summer Storm candles.  However, for a change of pace I decided to try the 'Magical Frosted Forest' scent ~ and what a huge mistake!  It emitted absolutely no aroma.  I don't know if there was a problem in the manufacturing process ~ if someone simply forget to add fragrance to the batch, but it was as if I was only burning scent-free paraffin wax.  Knowing that this was just an anomaly as I've never experienced a problem with any Yankee Product before, I'd just recommend against purchasing THIS specific candle."
1,28-Dec-16,5,"See Pictures! Awesome Fragrance! Quality Candle! Repeat buyer! I have been a fan of the Christmas Cookie fragrance for many years. I purchased two here at Amazon at half price! I couldn't be happier! They came well packaged and they smell wonderful. I have tried giving them as gifts in the past, but I can't seem to ever give one up!  Yankee Candles are a quality gift. They come in a large jar candle that will burn for many hours. The tight fitting lid, will snuff out your candle when you put it on. The candle always burns evenly and I have nothing but compliments and positive things to say! I try to purchase them when on sale because I do burn them all year long."
1,14-Feb-20,5,"Extremely HAPPY BAYBERRY SCENT!! I have been looking for this scent for years to decades!! I became addicted to this scent because of my sweet Grandmother, Nola. She loved Christmas and loved candles. She burned them all the time. I literally fell across this one by pure accident. I could not wait to open it and was thrilled to stick my nose in to the Yankee candle jar. It was AMAZING!! It instantly took me back to my childhood! It is called ‚ÄúHOLIDAY BAYBERRY‚Äù!! I refused to wait till CHRISTMAS. I immediately trimmed back the wick and have been burning it ever since! Im in LOVE!!‚ô•Ô?è‚ô•Ô?è‚ô•Ô?è Thank you."
1,28-Mar-17,5,"Christmas tree scent Christmas Wreath is a delicious, delightful Christmas tree or wreath scent that will fill with scented charm the entire room it burns in. One that delights and never tires the senses. I like it so much I've been burning it this winter past the holidays and even early spring when I need a mood boast or pick me up. I adore the scent and the warm holiday feeling it evokes very very much! One of 3 top Christmas candles by Yankee Candle. Prefer in Large Pillar style rather than old fashioned jar, but this is all Amazon carries. Highly recommend. Yankee candle is lovely because they are non-toxic and are not so strong so they do not give you a headache."
1,10-Dec-18,2,"Just Not the Same! Buyer beware! eta: Sorry for the length of this!!I love Yankee Candles, and when I saw them for this price, I ordered two of my favorite scents. Got them, (not in two days, however), and they were safely and well packaged inside a sort of thick cardboard eggcrate packaging.  It kept it from breaking. (I had received one last year which was only wrapped in bubble wrap, and it was broken and unusable.)I Opened these, which were  ""Christmas Cookie"" and ""Home for the Holidays"". They smelled good in the jars and I lit them, one at a time in different rooms.Total disappointment. They don't burn the faintest scent, even when you stand with your nose to them. Right after the flame got longer,  I snuffed them out and trimmed the wicks and relit them, as I have been taught to do. You can smell wax burning--that's it. Also, the lip of the jar is so thin and fragile, you must be very careful trying to fit the top back on. They didn't use to be quite this thin.The one I got as a gift last year was from here, and it was broken in several places at the lip.  I thought, and still do, that it was because it was bubblewrapped carelessly. I used to pay $25 at least for these large candles, and I had to save up to get them! (Still do!)Here I saw these large Yankee Candles, and was thrilled at the price, thinking the prices had finally gone down, for  when I ordered, they were just below $14.00 each.The lable looks the same, so I can't figure if these were somehow cheap knockoffs or what. The scents when you open the top are good--but there's no emittion of that scent while burning. Have Yankee candles diluted their formerly wonderful product? Hopefully not!  Last night, I lit a candle from a large big-box store we all have heard of. It was an off brand that I picked up for eight bucks, and soon it was wafting all over the house. Unfortunately, it smelled like grape soda!There is something very off when Yankee Candles don't do ""their thing"". We live on a fixed income and I rarely buy items of ""luxury"" like this, but these were sort of  my Christmas gift to me! I know in the broad scope of things, this is a rather small thing, but Yankee Candles have never, ever disappointed me!! If you can find a local dealer or can order directly from Yankee Candle's own storer, hopefully they will send you the great product for which they are known. I now have two candles which just will be handy if the power goes out. ?üò®"
1,31-Dec-17,1,Not worth the money. This candle has as much fragrance as a picture of an evergreen tree.
1,26-Jan-19,5,"As advertised You can't beat a Yankee candle. I'm a full grown 60 year old man that knows when times are stressful, a great way to help destress is by taking care of myself in my home. My best friend and fishing buddy was diagnosed with terminal cancer. I live in a beautiful area of the forest in northern California. He and his wife would come up often in his final years. I would light candles in their guest room before they arrived and they always commented on how nice it was to walk into the room with that smell. Having a nice scented candle when trying to let go of the weight is a great way to let go. Treat yourself or a friend to a little relaxer now and then."
1,5-Jan-20,5,"Nice Scent I love when these candles are on sale. I try to buy the large YC's for $15 or less. They arrived in good condition and I was a fan of how long they last. Make sure to get a stick lighter to reach in there as the wax runs out. They look nice and are a product I'll buy again. I think though I have a cold the scent is coming off weak. It's too bad glade candles smell too much so I like to stick to these. I like how they come off in the evening, Im suddenly into candle light at night..."
1,18-Nov-20,1,"Arrived misshapen/melted, wick buried Well, it smells nice. I had it shipped in November in the northeast and it arrived as if it had melted and solidified on its side, the wick completely hidden in the wax. It must have been like this prior to shipping since it has been highs of 50. Considering the price of these candles, very disappointed. I can probably dig around and find the wick but I shouldn't have to..."
1,27-Feb-20,5,Good memories with no asthmatic symptoms We purchase a Yankee Candle every year for the holidays.  It is traditionally a family event.  This year had sicknesses and distance so we ordered the candle for the first time.  It was still a family event.  We love the scent of the candle and burn it almost every day during the holidays.  The scent brings such a good atmosphere and good memories.  I  have asthma and can't tolerate most candle scents.  I have not had a reaction to any of our holiday candles yet.
1,25-Aug-19,1,"TERRIBLE! Unfortunately, I used up my last Yankee Candle (Balsam and Cedar), and ordered a replacement for $21.62, plus tax.  I loved the original, but received this and burned it for several HOURS and almost NO SCENT.  Why is this?  Yankee has apparently changed their product, but are still selling it for the same (expensive) price.  No deal.  I won't be buying another Yankee Candle, unless they change back to their original formula and I happen to hear about it."
1,24-Jan-20,1,"where did the scent go? i've been buying yankee christmas cookie candles for years.  they're my favorite scent.  i thought i found a bargain with the price here on amazon.  now i know why the price was so low - these have absolutely no scent.added a few days later:  after trying two of the three that i bought, one has no scent whatsoever, and the other made my living room smell like someone had just dumped gasoline.  i'm really disappointed."
1,10-Nov-19,3,"Not Very Strong The Balsam & Cedar scent is great, but it just does not smell as strong as I remember it smelling when my mom used to buy this candle. I can only smell it when I'm nearby, as opposed to making an entire room smell like Christmas tree. It makes me question whether this is an authentic Yankee Candle or not."
1,22-Nov-20,5,"Love it !!! I miss the smell of real Christmas trees , evergreen is a amazing scent. The candle is lite right now and my entire house smells amazing!!! I can‚Äôt wait until we get our tree this year but until then I have this wonderful candle to enjoy !!! It can in a box with extra protection to keep it from breaking which was one of my fears"
1,15-Dec-18,5,"The only candle of this brand that I like We normally buy more expensive soy candles and I dislike pretty much all the Yankee Candle candles because they smell way too strong and most of them smell like food. I don‚Äôt want my house to smell like dang ‚Äúsugar cookies‚Äù or ‚Äúsnicker doodles‚Äù or ‚Äúcoconut rum pound cake‚Äù or ‚Äúgeneral tso‚Äôs chicken‚Äù or ‚Äúshrimp and linguini in a pesto cream sauce with capers and fresh parsley, accompanied by a tart Pinot Noir and followed by an amaretto cheese cake with Cuban expresso‚Äù.This has a pleasant clean crisp smell and I buy one every Christmas."
1,20-Nov-19,1,Yet another Yankee Candle with no smell... Christmas Cookie used to be one of my favorite scents but now the flavor is barely existent. I don‚Äôt know what is happening with Yankee Candles. The last couple of years the quality had dropped radically. I have been getting so many duds with no smell for which I have paid a total of hundreds of dollars for. I am honestly about to be done with them.
1,15-Nov-20,1,"You can do better, not safe I thought this was a good brand but apparently not. A quarter way through burning the top of the glass turn black. The candle burns with plums of smoke coming out. Unusable and unsafe."
1,24-Jan-20,5,"Holiday Bayberry by Yankee Candle (discontinued scent) Wonderful holiday scented candle that is now discontinued. I've bought as many as I could to hoard the original scent as they ruined it with the ""snow dusted bayberry"" version. They also brought out a weak ""bayberry"" candle holiday 2019 that didn't have much going for it. If you can pick up the original Holiday Bayberry, you won't be sorry. It's an classic, similar to ""White Christmas"" (also discontinued)."
1,15-Nov-19,5,"""Christmas Cookie"" is a favorite! Very nice holiday smell. Not overpowering at all. I ordered 4 various yankee candles for my moma nd 3 for myself. This 'Christmas Cookie' scent was the clear winner!  The other two scents I bought for myself were very very bad however (Home Sweet Home, and Salted Caramel)."
1,1-Apr-20,5,"Feels Like Christmas I love this Balsam and Cedar candle.  It smells like a nice Christmas tree.  I can burn it year round and feel the joys of the holiday.  It doesn‚Äôt close up my throat and make me sneeze like a normal Christmas tree.  It is lovely, not so overpowering that it gives you a headache.  I cannot stand those nasty flowery, perfumy candles that you can almost taste in the air."
1,19-Nov-18,5,Great Smell I ordered this candle without knowing for sure the smell of it. I just wanted a candle that gave that Christmas smell and this Balsam and Cedar totally nailed it. Everyone who enters my office says or asks for that Christmas Tree smell. I even had to re-order 4 additional jars for my other colleagues. Loved it!
1,28-May-20,4,My son likes it! This is a very strong woodsy smell..my son loves it!  This is the first time I can blow a scented candle out in less than 10 minutes as the smell sufficiently fills an area quickly.  The afterwards linger time good too.  Caution: If you are sensitive to strong  odor...be careful not to smell this scent right when you first open it.. give it some breathe seconds then distant smell it.
1,28-Nov-19,5,A must have I buy this balsam first candle every year so my guests say ‚Äúoh I love the scent of a real tree‚Äù and my tree is fake.This seller is great. You should know that amazon delivery was horrible and took three days driving around my house making excuses to not drop it off. Nothing to do with this product. Telling you so you can scold delivery to get on the ball.
1,9-Nov-19,5,"Great scent Good buy and worth the money. I was worried about buying this because I live in Florida and was worried the heat would melt the candle and id receive a deformed candle, but that wasn't the case. Great holiday scent, you can't go wrong with it for the price"
1,16-Nov-20,5,"Yankee Candles are the BEST! This candle smells exactly like a Christmas tree and really helps get me in the spirit! Very long burn time, would make a perfect gift!"
1,7-Nov-19,5,Must Have For The Holidays This is the PERFECT candle for the holiday season. The balsm scent is very strong and makes the entire room smell like a Christmas tree. This is a large candle so it lasts a long time and burns pretty evenly. I buy several of them every winter.
1,13-Feb-19,1,"There is something wrong with this candle I have been burning Yankee candles for years.  There is something wrong with this Red Apple Wreath candle.  From day one, it sputtered and sizzled when I tried to light the wick; like there is water in the candle.  I persisted, because I do like the smell, but it hasn't gotten better.  Oftentimes the candle puts itself out. leaving an unpleasant smoke pervading the air.  When I trim the wick, necessary to prevent black smoke when it gets too long, it starts up with the sputtering again when I try to light it.  I've tried putting the candle under a warmer to melt the wax, to pour out some of the wax, to elongate the wick.  This has been a fruitless process.  I've ended up pouring half of the candle out, trying to get it to burn properly.  At this point, the wick is too long.  Black smoke pours off of it when lit.  I'm afraid to trim it anymore, in fear that I'll have to pour out even more of what little is left of the wax.  I am very disappointed in this candle.  I wonder if it is truly a Yankee candle."
1,12-Jan-20,4,"Beautiful fresh scent Red Apple is probably my favorite of all the scents.This candle doesn‚Äôt let me down with the true Red Apple scent either!It fills my kitchen with that fresh apple scent after cooking something delicious, but smelly.I wouldn‚Äôt feel comfortable giving this as a gift, because there were lots of tiny irregular bubbles on one side of the jar."
1,26-Nov-17,5,"Better than expected. First time Yankee Candle buyer here. I was skeptical of buying a candle online at first, but was tempted to try out this one because of the holidays and good reviews. I just want to say that this scent is the best scent I've ever smelled. It smells like a real Christmas tree, and has other hints of sweet scent to it as well. I love the glass it came in too, makes my house look very elegant. :) I light it in the kitchen and can smell it all throughout the house, it's quite strong.Anyone who's having doubts about this candle.... Look no further! You'll love this scent. :) Will definitely be buying this again soon."
1,24-Dec-19,2,"Must be old stock, little if any scent I am a big fan of Yankee candles and I bought two for the holidays. I light one every day in my den. It is almost 3/4 finished and it must be from old stock as I have tried all the usual tricks to get a candle to burn successfully but to no avail. No one can smell it. Very disappointed. Bought at beginning of month and not sure what to do with 2nd jar."
1,20-Dec-16,1,"Not my mamas Yankee candle from my past.?ü§î Weak smell, had to almost stick my nose in the flame to smell anything at all. I did smell my nose hairs though.?üòÄ Returns to Amazon is always no problem. When I was a kid my mother bought Yankee and it ould fill the house with wonderful smells. I believe the quality is gone but the cost hasn't. Try it maybe you'll get a good one. Odds are 100 /1, good luck."
1,12-Sep-20,5,"Nice Mellow Scent Yankee Candles are the best if you like the scent you buy.  This candle is a mild scent and not over whelming.  Yankee always puts enough scent in their candles so you get the scent when it burns down at the bottom.  Most scents give me headaches , but this one did not."
1,1-Jan-19,5,"These are the Best! So happy to find Yankee Candles on Amazon at an affordable price as they are such good, long burning candles. They don't smoke up the house like that Candle-Lite brand, you can see, and smell a billow of black smoke from that brand., not from Yankee Candles. Long burning with moderate fragrance, not overpowering, just enough for burning a candle for hours, although the Balsam & Cedar is one of the more fragrant ones I've tried from Yankee."
1,9-Dec-19,5,"Great smell, great gift We love this candle! The smell is present, but not overly strong. Amazon had the  best price of any other places we looked. We've gifted this one many times to family, friends, and co-workers. It's great!"
1,7-Apr-20,1,no smell to this what so ever i have been buying Yankee candles for quite some time now. But this is the second purchase where the candle has absolutely no smell what so ever. No scent when burning.I wont purchase Yankee again unless it is from bed bath and beyond and maybe not from them.  this is what i get for ordering this online
1,30-Dec-19,2,"DISAPPOINTING beautiful color - nice label, virtually no scent - while lit or unlit.  Yankee Candle is not what they used to be - you can get longer lasting SCENT from many other candles and gasp... even grocery store candles.  would not purchase again.  oh and I tried to complain to the company directly - 4 weeks later, no response.  Very  disappointing -"
1,8-Dec-16,1,Very Very weak scent I am giving this one star because it does smell like a Christmas  Tree. The problem with this candle is it has a very weak scent. Even after burning for several hours it does not smell. For what they charge for this you would think it would be as good as other top name candles. The only way I can smell this candle is to walk up to it and stick my nose right up to it. This could be because they only have one wick or because Yankee Candle Company is  cutting corners to make a profit and they are not putting enough of the scent in the candles.
1,13-Nov-20,1,"Cheap made stuff with mold like texture on top It has some weird mold-like texture. I dont know how good this out because this is my first time buying this. But i am not very satisfied, first impression is this as you as you can see. My wife thinks i am a cheap ass who for buying her this. I hate this product and hate who make this."
1,2-Oct-19,5,Artificial  tree for Xmas - real smell in the house :) This is my favorite candle for the real Xmas tree smell.  I long ago quit putting up real trees and resorted to the pre-lit fake variety.  This candle makes me feel better about myself and the smell in the house :)
1,3-Feb-20,5,"Smells like Christmas! Glad to have found my favorite Christmas scent here - it really does smell just like balsam and cedar, like the inside of a cabin in the mountains! Most other Christmas-type scents are too sweet, artificial, headache inducing, etc. but never this one. Doesn't need to burn for long to have a good throw."
1,19-Nov-19,5,"Nostalgic holiday scent This one tunneled a bit, but what can you do. I love the scent and its typical, fantastic yankee candle quality. This scent reminds me so much of Christmas as a child, I absolutely love it."
1,23-Jan-19,3,"Price good, shipping bad This is a good candle, not great. The first burn smelled really good, I burned 2 hours and trimmed the wick. Subsequent burns have not been as fragrant. Additionally, even though it was Prime, it took 19 DAYS to receive. I got two emails saying it was delayed. That was pretty frustrating because I ordered it with a dinner party in mind.BE PREPARED FOR REALLY SLOW SHIPPING. SLOWER THAN ADVERTISED."
1,14-Jan-20,5,Great if gotten at reduced price I love scented candles but have always found Yankee Candle a bit overpriced for my preference. I was able to snatch this one at a discount and I gotta say I understand why they're so expensive! It's got a ton of scent packed in it and it lasts a long time. Definitely worth buying a large stock at a discount.
1,23-Nov-20,2,"Very faint scent, wax build up I love balsam candles, especially the one from Bath & Body Works, but this Yankee variety doesn't put off much of a scent and it constantly pools up with liquefied wax, making the wicks burn very low and inefficiently."
1,23-May-16,5,CHRISTMAS IS NOT THE SAME WITHOUT THE SMELL OF A YANKEE BALSAM AND CEDAR CANDLE I love the smell of this candle.  I just smells like Christmas to me.  I really do look forward to lighting it every year.  It makes my house smell wonderful.  I will without a doubt be buying more of these.  Thank You for a great product.  Rosa
1,30-Jan-20,5,"Very sad they retired this scent This was my favorite Yankee Candle scent and did not cause me to have an allergic reaction.  I was very sad to hear they are no longer making this scent. I ordered multiple candles, put some away for myself and gave some as gifts.  Not sure why they would retire this very popular scent."
1,9-Nov-20,5,Wonderful I do not understand the negative reviews. This is the best scented candle I have found. It smells the same intensity as Yankee candles always have. The price is great for such a large jar. Smells like Christmas.
1,7-May-20,5,Love this jar candle!!!! 3rd Christmas Cookie Yankee Candle jar candle I have purchased. These candles last a super long time and smell great until the end! I'll continue to purchase these!!!!I absolutely love this jar candle! Super long burn time and smells amazing.
1,24-Oct-20,5,"Yankee Fan I usually use wax melts, but enjoy burning Yankee candles when we have guests because they fill the house with a welcoming smell faster and usually stronger. Also great for burning when watching holiday movies."
1,25-Dec-19,5,"Great Christmas tree smell Since we have an artificial tree, this candle is a great substitute for the smell of trees. I burned it almost every night for a few weeks and it‚Äôs about halfway used. The only issue I have with it is that the wick isn‚Äôt big enough to burn from end to end, so there is some tunneling involved."
1,27-Feb-17,1,"Was my favorite but recent order was not same as previous.  Scent more chemical and jar label not the same. One of my favorite and still has that wonderful Yankee Candle smell that reminds me of fresh baked cookies.  Works for my teenage granddaughter as well......since lighting one of these 'fools' her every time as she excitedly jumps out of bed in the mornings while visiting me to see what I am baking.  (Great way to get a teenager Up early on the weekends....lol).Just got a recent order but label on jar candle was not same as pictured, nor same as previous ones.  Scent more chemical and does not burn as cleanly....smokey.......not sure what is going on, but don't think this is authentic Yankee candle or? See photo of this label on purchase attached"
1,24-Feb-17,3,"Okay Candle Winter Glow definitely smells similar to cologne. It has a masculine scent, which isn't bad at all but it's very strong. If that is the smell you are going for then you will love this candle. I was expecting it to be a little softer but it's a very prominent smell. With Yankee Candle's great quality the scent lingers for a very long time. Normally that's a good thing but it's too strong for me."
1,22-Nov-19,4,"Great Birthday Gift! I bought this for my mom for her birthday and she loved it ! The scent was is strong that you could smell it from the other side of the house! The packaging kept it nice and safe, no chips or cracks. It was also a good price for Yankee Candle too.It came the day after so not bad at all."
1,29-Jan-20,1,"Don't waste your money! Very poor quality. Very little sent produced. Wick and candle design severely flawed. Candle burns a channel down the center of the candle until the wick drowns in melted wax and goes out. Wick and candle size is mismatched and thus candle is useless, a waste of money."
1,11-Dec-19,2,"Not worth the price VS wally world brand. I typically have a candle burning all day in the winter.  So I have really figured out the best to buy at this point. For the money you can do a lot better driving to your local W-Mart store and buy the candles with the wood topper, round. They are $7 and smell better, stronger."
1,30-Oct-18,1,"Only good as a light source When I first opened the candle it smelled divine. Then I started burning it. The candle emits no odor at all. In fact, when you stick your nose inside the jar, you can't smell anything but wax. The initial scent was gone before the candle even burned. Useless. I should have listened to other reviewers."
1,25-May-20,2,"Not much scent I consider this candle a middle grade one based on the price.  However, the scent is very faint unless it is burned for an extended (1+ hrs) period of time.  Low end Walmart candles are better all around at less than half the price."
1,7-May-20,5,Great experience I‚Äôve ordered the Yankee Candle large Jar Balsam and Cedar scent I think like 5 times now. I‚Äôve never had an issue with breakage or anything and the candles seem very fresh. I always try and catch the prices when they are at $12. Check back because the prices fluctuate all the time!
1,5-Dec-19,5,Great Gift Ordered one for each mother-in-law and they loved it.  Got one for myself to make sure the scent was authentic and it is.  Great buy!
1,11-Mar-18,3,"This season‚Äôs batches are coming through with indentations throughout the candles I have bought this candle numerous times throughout the years. It is usually as a Christmas gift. However this year the first one came in with indentations around the entire candle and a big circular indentation in the side. I re-ordered from a new batch, and I have vertical indentations, again, in two spots around the candle. Has anyone else experienced this? They are not cheap candles, but it seems the quality control has gone down."
1,11-May-20,5,"Good smell Surprisingly, what I like most about this candle is that it makes the room smell good and woodsy, even when not lit.  Like a long lasting air freshener!  (Tip:  Take it out of the glass - it will make the room smell better)"
1,8-Dec-17,3,"Disappointed.. For a Yankee candle, I'm disappointed. It has a weak fragrance. I want a candle that smells like baked cookies. I will have to go to where they sale candles and first smell them prior to purchasing them."
1,16-Aug-20,2,Be wary Not even a third of the way into the candle the glass shattered. I've had this for only 2 weeks before it was rendered useless. I removed the lid and the top it was attached to shattered. Would hope for better from the brand. Scent was pleasant.
1,22-Nov-19,5,Worth every penny Yankee candles are one of my favorite candles. They have a such good smells and when they are lit it is strong enough it fills the room but it is not over powering. This particular smell is my husbands favorite and he looks forward to it during the Christmas season.
1,28-Nov-18,5,"The perfectly-strengthed scent! The scent is spot on and it's subtle enough to not be overwhelming but present enough so it's not lacking. Pretty deep green, it's huge - I've only lit twice but it seems to be wearing down slowly, think I'll get a nice long shelf life out of it!"
1,23-Nov-20,5,"Great scent and price! What's not to love! I love everything about Yankee Candles.. except the price!!! So when I catch a good deal on Amazon for them, I grab it! These are reg $25 large 3 wick candles that I bought for $14. I love Amazon!!! And Yankee candles!!"
1,27-Oct-20,4,"Yankee Candle VS cheaper Candles Regardless of the premium price of a Yankee candle, the strong scent and the safety of the product, I'd still buy this product again. Made in the USA w/global components."
1,2-Dec-18,1,"Thinner Glass Jar.  Be Careful!! This broke when I put the lid on. Yankee changed the jar to thinner glass!  I compared with another Yankee jar.  Maybe this is just to make better deals with this Christmas Balsam candle.  But cripes, stick with the quality we are accustomed to."
1,14-Jan-19,5,"An Evenly Burning Scented Candle that Lasts Long and Fills the Air with Its Aroma! The bayberry was a lot stronger than the scented oil lamps we used to light when I was a child, but the fragrance definitely fills the room with its scent! It burns the wax evenly and lasts long! I like that. That is actually a make or break deal for me! I searched far and wide for a bayberry candle and was delighted to find this one!"
1,11-Jul-20,5,"Lovely scent One of my favorite scents by Yankee Candle! Arrived quickly, burns nicely, and the scent is strong enough to fill my house but not so strong that it is irritating. Will definitely be buying again!"
1,1-Mar-20,1,"Do Not Buy The candle came completely broken. The glass was shattered everywhere and trying to get it out of the box I cut myself on the glass. Luckily I had a wax warmer to melt the candle remains, because the candle was completely unable to burn but a waste of time and money to return."
1,8-Dec-19,5,"Best candles around. As always, Yankee candles are the best!I got this for my daughter in law and she really liked it."
1,4-Dec-18,3,"Pump The Breaks Before Buying I love Yankee Candle‚Äôs! Fall and Christmas scents are my favorites. I‚Äôve always felt the price was fair for what I received however this time I truly think the scent was not near as strong as my past purchases. I wouldn‚Äôt purchase again online, that‚Äôs for sure! The price on this candle was not equal to what I received.Kinda bummed."
1,28-Jan-20,5,"Amazing scent One of the best candles I have ever purchased! The scent fills my townhouse, quickly rids the home of the lingering smell of food after dinner and just smells like Christmas ?üòª! We are over a month in and it‚Äôs still going strong lol"
1,27-Dec-19,5,"Good long lasting candles I love yankee candles for the quality of the scent, they don‚Äôt give me headaches but are normally still strong. This one however didn‚Äôt smell as strong. You had to be pretty close to smell it but the burn time is good. They burn a lot slower than bath and body candles."
1,18-Dec-19,5,Love! I‚Äôve ordered 5 of the Balsam and Cedar candles at different times. All came in unbroken and smell just like the ones you get from the store! They burn so great and last so long! Got a few for gifts and they love them. Great price for a great product!
1,8-Feb-20,5,Best in the market What else is there to say about Yankee Candle. They don‚Äôt have to be reviewed. They are the best in the market without a doubt. You will see this review on three other Scents. Yes I bought three. I love the candle they produce.
1,3-Feb-17,4,"Great scent! Could be a little stronger! Literally smells like a fresh Christmas tree!  I get a real tree every year and it's exactly the same.  Only giving this 4 stars because the scent is surprisingly not that strong.  I have the candle in a ""mini living room"" upstairs in my house, and even with the ceiling fan on low blowing it around, it takes a little to circulate.  If anything, the scent is probably toned down a bit because pine can be really strong.  Would buy again!"
1,11-Oct-17,4,Candles I love Yankee Candles.  They seem to last a long time and most of them smell devine.  I've tried around four different scents and this was one of my favorites.  I love the smell of forests and Christmas.
1,21-Nov-20,5,"Perfect candle in glass Always a good candle to buy. I'm never disappointed burns great,  the scent is mildand last a long time. It's is great to use if your lights go out."
1,26-Jan-20,5,Excellent long lasting aromic candle This is the ultimate perfect candle.  Smells great with great throw and don't have to baby it with moving wax in and out.  I have bought several and will again.  The 1 wick ones need too much handling to make it worthwhile.
1,15-Dec-16,4,"Nice subtle scent for our living area This candle is just what I was looking for; something of good size to sit in the middle of a small artificial wreath on the table. I notice that it doesn't have a super strong scent but when I do notice it, it smells great. The color of the candle is a lovely deep forest green. I would recommend this to someone looking for a light winter scent in the room."
1,16-Nov-20,5,"Yankee Candle Tis the season for the best candle in the world. ""Her Candles Smell Awesome"" Amazing like always. Yankee candle is the best in the biz Facts!!! huge Win!"
1,26-Oct-18,5,"Great Scent Great scent, maybe a little strong even, but definitely smells like an oven full of sugar cookies being baked in my house when I burn this candle. Sugar, butter, vanilla, and a little cinnamon. Very much feels like a holiday candle."
1,29-May-20,5,No scent I‚Äôm so sad because this candle was always my fav. The whole house would fill with the smell of fresh baked cookies.  Unfortunately this candle has no scent at all ?üòî  not worth the money I paid
1,4-Jan-20,5,"Long lasting scent, not overpowering, long lasting burn Mistletoe is my favorite Christmas scent candle, yankee candle is my favorite brand for over 20 years, McIntosh apple for the fall, lilac for the spring and cotton sheet for the summer.  I have lots of others, but those are my staple ones."
1,12-Nov-20,1,Does not give off acent This candle gives off very little scent. I have bought this brand before and my experience was much better.
1,28-Feb-20,5,"Christmas Cookie smells so good, just like cookies.. I could smell it for 3 days after the first 4 hour burn, without re-lighting.  these do make some soot.. and once it gets past half gone, the scent isn't as strong anymore."
1,29-May-19,1,"Zero fragrance ..... waste of money The candle has no fragrance & just a little bit of wax smell. Annoying because i have to pay to send back it, to get a refund. Waste of money!"
1,31-Jan-20,5,"Yankee Candle offers the best scent & longest-lasting candles. The scent of Yankee Candle brand candles is the best and longest-lasting of any brand I've used, and their candles themselves are long-lasting. Amazon offers the best prices on these, so this is a no- brainer! I buy these for myself & as gifts for others. 5 stars all around."
1,13-Jan-20,3,Not worth the price I bought a few of these candles to have around for Christmas. I was disappointed oin all of them. This one had a little more scent than the other two (some pine and a cashmere) but still pretty feint. For some reason the scent is stronger when I blow it out. They look cute and seem to last a long time though. I can't wait until they're gone.
1,21-Jan-20,5,Very high quality candle If you really want a candle for your money this is the one to buy the name Yankee candles I have bought a lot of tea candles in my lifetime for my wife they sent glass throughout the whole jar highly recommended
1,12-Apr-19,1,"NO fragrance !! I have bought and loved Yankee Candles for years.  This one, Candy Cane, supposed to  smell like peppermint, has NO fragrance.  None in the small room where it has burned for hours so that the top inch is melted, and none if you go close and wave the air toward you.  Peppermint is a strong smell - you would think this candle would  have a strong smell, too, but instead, NONE.  Pick a different fragrance,"
1,9-Oct-18,1,"No smell,burned badly Defective Candle When I opened the jar it smelled lovely,but as it burned there is No Smell at all. After a few hours the wick died out and upon relighting it constantly it burned wrong than wouldn‚Äôt stay lit at all.  I tried everything but the wick wouldn‚Äôt stay lit. I had to throw it away. Really frustrating, a complete waste of money."
1,17-Mar-20,5,"For that holiday feeling all year round This candle has a great scent that isn't overwhelming or perfumey.  Even when the candle isn't burning, I leave the top off to get the occasional whiff of holiday spirit in the room."
1,21-Jun-20,1,"No scent Packaging was fine, arrived in one piece.On time delivery.There is absolutely no scent. Had this burning for hours, and nothing. Not even a faint scent unless I put my face to the fire. Would not recommend."
1,11-Dec-19,4,Smell amazing. Smell amazing. Enough said.  This single wick ‚Äòjar‚Äô candle seems to last much longer than the double wick straight candle. Don‚Äôt remember what that version is called but has straight sides like a drinking glass.
1,21-Jan-18,1,"It‚Äôs normally our favorite Christmas scent Not sure what happened to this one.  It‚Äôs  normally our favorite Christmas scent.  Normally very  fragrant . This particular jar had no scent at all . A lot of money for nothing.  Will try again next Christmas, but will save the packing this time and will send it back if it happens again."
1,11-Oct-19,1,Disappointed I've always loved Yankee candles. This candle has absolutely no smell while its burning. Very disappointed!
1,24-Sep-19,3,"Love the scent, wish they would center the wick better The scent is nice and fresh. My concern is the wick was not centered well making the burning somewhat uneven."
1,10-Jan-19,5,"Terrific bayberry scent! Just what I have been looking for to reminisce about the bayberry scent that I remember from my childhood. My Mom always burned Bayberry candles at the holidays and I have had a hard time finding great bayberry, this works. I love my candle and am still burning it. It lasts and lasts."
1,25-Nov-19,1,No pine scent while burning I love this scent normally but the one from Amazon has no scent when burned. I burned it for 2 hours and still smell nothing. This is clearly not the same quality balsam candle you get from a Yankee store.
1,29-Nov-19,5,"Lovely! What a wonderful fragrance for the holidays! A deep rich green, the product arrived today in excellent packing from the Yankee Candle folks. Nice strong aroma. I have no clue why I paid such a great price but if it aint broke..."
1,1-Feb-20,5,This fragrance is awesome for the house Love this scent!!!! And couldn't pass up the price. Only thing I dont like is the rim around the candle gets blackened I find I have to clean it. Other then that i love yankee candle candles
1,2-Dec-18,2,No holiday smells.  Ugh. This year I have my first artificial tree so needed some smells.  Ugh.  No smells from this candle.
1,30-Dec-19,5,Great Gift Whether buying for yourself or a gift you just can't beat Yankee Candles.  I love the Home Sweet Home one for the Holidays.  Great value for the money and Amazon had wonderful prices available.
1,15-Jan-20,3,"Not very strong scent Very light scent. Honestly was outshined by a Bath and Bodyworks candle, much to my surprise. It does burn forever, so high five for that, I guess. But the scent is too faint for a high rating."
1,24-Apr-14,5,"HOLIDAY BAYBERRY = BEST OF THE BEST ! I am very familiar with at least 90% of all Yankee Candles and let me tell you, HOLIDAY BAYBERRY is the #1 best ! When I have one burning it really does put and keep a smile on my face. A magical candle if you ask me. It really is a work of art.Similar to Yankee Candle Holiday Sage. It has a nice firm smell of Bayberry. Comparable to Sage, Pine & Cedar.Extremely Strong Recommendation to try this candle out! IT IS INCREDIBLE !"
1,17-Oct-19,5,"If You Like Eucalyptus/Balsam/Cedar.... If you like eucalyptus/balsam/cedar scent, buy this. The scent carry on it is unbelievable. It fills my entire condo."
1,20-Dec-14,5,"Perfect for the real tree smell Yankee candles are our favorite. They last the longest of any other candle, and in our tiny apartment -- they fill it up with a great aroma without being overpowering. We love this because with our fake tree it makes it feel like we have a real one! Worth the investment for a holiday scent without it being too much. Have used it nearly daily for 3+ hours in the evenings since purchasing early December -- and nearly 12 days later I still have half a candle left. Sometimes have left it on almost all day on the weekends."
1,21-Dec-19,1,Fake No scent whatsoever.  And I‚Äôve purchased this scent many times from the store.  Maybe these are fake??
1,28-Dec-17,4,"Love this scent I love the smell. Best part about it. Smells like apples with a bit of gingerbread. Despite this smell, the 22oz.  candle is not as long lasting as my previous Yankee candles. It's burned about 12 hours and it's almost about halfway done. The scent is still there and it's wonderful, but the candle burning time is lacking a little. I would buy the scent again."
1,7-Dec-19,5,Smells like Christmas Morning My absolute favorite candle. It‚Äôs a Christmas tradition every year for the past 15+ years to have a big jar. It‚Äôs just not Christmas without the wonderful aroma this candle brings into your home.
1,23-Dec-16,5,Authentic scent is longlasting I have a fake tree so I purchased this candle to give the house a festive smell.  It certainly does the job!  I leave it lit on my dining room table and with our open floor plan we smell it into the livingroom.  It burns clean and lasts a long time.  It reminds me of my childhood when we used to have a real tree.  Would buy again and am going to try the Bayberry next.
1,20-Dec-19,5,Great deal on a Yankee candle with a wonderful smell would buy again Great Yankee candle at a great price and a beautiful smile for someone who has artificial tree it smells like Christmas tree right in the living room I loved it and for $14 delivered you can‚Äôt
1,27-Dec-19,5,"My favorite scent I looooove this scent ! It‚Äôs a great room freshener for any time of year, and even for the holidays. I bought two and they came securely packaged and there were no cracks or scratches on the glass."
1,23-Nov-20,4,Burns for a decent amount of time The candle lasts a decent amount of time. Has anyone else noticed that Yankee scents aren't as strong anymore?
1,4-Mar-19,5,Long lasting and smells great! This candle smells amazing! It does a great job making our entire first floor smell wonderful. We‚Äôve gotten many compliments on how nice it smells. It also has lasted a long time. I typically have it lot for 3-4 hours a day and it has lasted nearly 4 months!
1,5-Apr-17,5,Who doesn't love Yankee Candles? Love the smell ... and the last time I purchased this it lasted as long as the one wick jar candle - even though the hours are supposed to be less - I burned both at the same time and both burned out at the same time.
1,25-Feb-19,5,"The only real smelling candle! I bought this candle to replace the smell of having a real Christmas tree. I have not found another candle on the planet that smells as real as this. If you have a fake Christmas tree but want that real Christmas tree smell, this is the only candle you need to get. Well done Yankee!"
1,23-Jun-13,5,"Best Candle Company I've always loved this product and other scents from this company. But, I have to admit I tried to save a bit of money and ordered from another company (Our Own Candle Company) because of their price and different types of scents. Never again will I do this because now I have grey walls from the black smoke from the candles. So, if I would have stayed with what I knew, I wouldn't have had to pay to have my walls cleaned and wasted money on a cheaper product. ""You get what you pay for"" rings loudly for me. Thanks for the excellent product."
1,7-Oct-20,5,"Nice outdoor scent This is a great candle to bring the outdoors inside for your home.  It smells wonderful, like a walk in the woods!"
1,6-Aug-14,5,"This candle is great for spreading that real Christmas tree scent around your ... This candle is great for spreading that real Christmas tree scent around your house.  I buy these candles because the Yankee Candle Company seems to be the only company that really replicated the real smell of a pine tree, and it's great where you're using an artificial tree.  Other pine tree scents smell like Pinesol or have an element of perfume, but this scent (in the candle form or other forms that Yankee Candle produces) very closely replicates the actual scent of a pine tree."
1,10-Jan-20,5,"Quality Candles for Burn and Scent Yankee candles have a good scent and burn well.  Love balsam during winter and holidays.  As long as you trim the wick, it will burn right to the bottom.  Good price on Amazon."
1,11-Dec-19,5,Perfect Christmas scent Perfect scent for Christmas !!! So I‚Äôm a little disappointed and Yankee candles as they‚Äôre sent doesn‚Äôt seem to be nearly as strong as it was in the beginning when they first came out
1,26-Nov-18,5,Good candle ! I love how this candle was packaged !!! The shipper did an amazing job keeping the candle safe which I was concerned about and I love the candle ! I haven‚Äôt lit it yet to see if there is a strong or light smell but I use the candle for our romantic holiday nights so I‚Äôm happy
1,18-Apr-20,1,Do not smell Don‚Äôt smell
1,15-Feb-18,5,"New holiday favourite This scent has become one of my holiday favourites.  it smells just like warm apple cider, or like someone's baking an apple pie.  So warm and the throw of the scent is perfect."
1,29-Oct-17,5,"THE BEST One of the best smells---- I wish they would come up with more ""tree type scents, Like Blue spruce or Frasier fur. But as with all yankee the smell is strong and fills the entire house with just one candle."
1,23-Oct-17,5,"Lovely natural scent. Delicious woodsy aroma, and I live in the mountains so I am picky about finding fresh aromas for the house. No overwhelming pine scent either which some candle makers use. Great for freshening a bathroom or lingering cooking odors. Just which they did not cost over 20 dollars a pop!"
1,31-Jan-20,5,"Perfect Holiday Candle Great scent, burns forever. I regularly had people comment on how much they loved the smell of this candle, and am looking forward to getting another for next Christmas!"
1,13-Dec-19,5,Great smelling. I have been burning this candle since the 1st day of December. I absolutely love the scent.I have severe allergies to real Christmas trees so this is the next best thing to me.
1,11-Apr-17,5,My boyfriend can't get enough. Unfortunately I can.  This candle is outstanding.  It smells exactly like what it says.  Cookies.  And lots of them.  I smell this candle and gain 5lbs.
1,13-Dec-19,5,Smells amazing! I received my package and the glass was shattered. Amazon immediately resolved the situation by sending a new one right away. This is why I love Amazon! The candle smells amazing!
1,28-Jan-20,4,"Nice Candle This is a nice candle but the scent is weak. It is a single wick, which I prefer to the 3 wick candles, and it does last a long time. For the price, I was expecting more"
1,5-Nov-19,5,LOVE IT!!! I‚Äôve been looking for the scent for a while. They‚Äôre been out of stock. I‚Äôm assuming they discontinued this scent. Gosh I hope they bring it back. I love this candle
1,8-Dec-19,5,Excellent product I‚Äôve been burning Yankee candles for years.  This is a favorite
1,5-Aug-19,5,"Amazing scent My absolute favorite Yankee candle scent, and I got it on sale for $13.50. Hope to see that price again soon"
1,24-Aug-17,5,"Fresh and woodsy ""Balsam & Cedar"" candle! Yankee Candle Company makes a great product. And this is one of my favorite scents, good all year round. Their Balsam & Cedar candle has a fresh, clean, woodsy scent made with pure and natural plant extracts. It's not overpowering, rather I find it serene."
1,27-Oct-14,4,"Red Apple Wreath is absolutely delightful My favorite autumn/winter transition scent- Red Apple Wreath! It's not overpowering with sweetness, yet has some added spice to warm you up and make you feel content.My purchase arrived on time with adequate packaging to protect the glass jar and lid. Yankee candle has always paid close attention to detail so I know that I'll have many days of enjoyment with my purchase- made in the USA!"
1,8-Nov-20,5,Worth every penny This candle is definitely worth the price. No smoke and amazing Christmas tree scent. Love it!
1,18-Nov-19,5,Great buy. Love it. I use different scents for different times of the year
1,30-Apr-20,2,"Lasts veeeeery long Very pungent hit of christmas, very sweet peppery minty apple. I didnt ejoy, but someone might if they like super sweet apple pine smells."
1,26-Oct-18,5,Yankee quality These candles are typical Yankee candle quality and would buy again. I had one candle show up that was on it's side and melted. A quick e-mail and it was replaced very quickly.
1,26-Oct-20,5,It's the perfect jar candle We keep a candle burning in our office during business hours.  This candle lasts and leaves the office smelling so nice.  It's perfect - year round.
1,6-Mar-20,5,Smells like a Christmas tree in here Probably the better of the two green/Xmas-scented Yankee Candles I bought this year.Scent lasted longer.Got six continuous days of burn.
1,29-Jan-20,5,"A nicely scented candle This candle has a good Christmas scent.  It lasted three days of burning nonstop.  However, I found one for half the price in a grocery store and it performed identically."
1,22-Nov-20,5,Holiday favorite! I was very impressed with how well this was packed. Has a nice hot throw and the scent is perfect. Not overwhelming like a lot of ‚Äúsweet‚Äù candles.
1,30-Dec-19,5,Best candles on the market Yankee candles are the best candles on the market! The scents are great and this may be my favorite! It isn‚Äôt overpowering and makes the house smell like warm cookies.
1,11-Nov-20,5,"Best Holiday Scents.. Christmas tree Perfect Christmas scent.Nice and strong,  long lasting.One of my favorites.."
1,6-Jan-20,4,"Nice, large candle Lightly scented, and I am hoping it will have a good throw for a medium sized room.  It's a typical large, Yankee Candle that shipped quickly and packaged well."
1,6-May-20,5,My favorite scent I‚Äôve tried a lot of different Yankee Candles and this specific one is the one with the strongest scent so I keep coming back to it
1,19-Jul-19,1,Useless.  NO SCENT 2nd try  Counterfit? Yankee candles are expensive from the start.  I believe these are factory seconds or thirds.  There is very little scent coming from these.  Disappointing rip off.
1,15-Feb-20,5,Love this brand of candle and it‚Äôs long lasting scent. First of all Yankee candles are known for their longevity and the beautiful scent aroma spreading from the candle lasts until the candle is finished.
1,1-Jan-19,5,Loved it. You have many fragrances to chose from. I chose baking cookies. It was the next best thing to the cookies. It made a fine gift. If I were ever going to sell a house l would  keel them going when ever showing it. My niece loved it.Paul Noll
1,12-Sep-19,5,Yankee Candle It's a Yankee Candle. Smells good last long time and at a good price here
1,1-Jan-20,5,Christmas in a jar My favorite holiday scent! I love the pine scent it smells like Christmas without the hassle of cutting down the tree and cleaning up the fallen pine needles.
1,23-Oct-20,5,Smells nice Has a nice apple scent. They last a long time. Would make a great gift. Nicely packaged.
1,7-Sep-19,1,Fake candles This product looks and smells like someone took an old yankee candle jar and replaced it with a no scent homemade candle.
1,2-Jan-20,5,BEST SCENT FOR CHRISTMAS! FABULOUS FULL BODIED SCENT welcomes you the minute ute you enter my home!! BEST scent I bought for Christmastide season. Highly recommend
1,21-Nov-18,1,"Great smelling Jar candle, broken jars Ordered 2 of these. Received both jars broken! Very disappointing."
1,21-Dec-19,5,"ONE OF THE SCENTS WE USE! Have had this scent before so I knew it'd be great! You enter the room & you can smell this scent. It's a warm, pine scent. This time of year it's perfect!"
1,16-Aug-19,5,"Good value Compared to the brick and mortar store, this is a good buy. Great Christmas gift."
1,24-Jun-20,5,Yankee candles do I have to say anything else! Love Yankee candles. Wish the scent was stronger. Very giftable who doesn't love Yankee candles? Longevity yes!
1,25-Dec-19,5,Buy it I love yankee candles and this candle has the perfect scent. I gifted it to 3 different people with different styles and all loved. It burns clean as well.
1,13-Mar-19,1,"wimpy wicks This is something I've experienced from Yankee candles so why did I buy another one? The wick burned so short 1/3 of it is wasted! And it comes with two wicks. I never have this problem with cheaper candles, like Walmart's."
1,10-May-16,5,"Christmas tree scent that makes up for an artificial tree Ordered for Christmas time to add Christmas tree smell to our home since we have an artificial tree, and this was perfect. I liked this candle so much that I lit it daily until it wore out, and I plan to buy another for Christmas next year. I also liked that the label wasn't quite as ""Christmas-y""  looking as some so it wouldn't seem weird to use it into January."
1,20-Apr-18,1,Quality is Not what they Used to be! Might be me but Yankee candles (quality) just are Not what they used to be. I‚Äôve purchased more than one & none of them burn properly or last long to even Near bottom of jar. Think I‚Äôm done w Yankee Candles.
1,10-Dec-18,5,Best Christmas Candle Ever This is our family favorite candle for the holidays.  We burn at least one per week so our house smells like a Christmas Tree for the season.  I love that the candle burns evenly and almost completely without leaving a ton of wax unused.
1,31-Dec-19,5,"Nice candle, nice scent, nice value This is a nice yankee candle scent.  Not too overpowering and it does smell like sugar cookies.  Candle was sent promptly and very well packaged."
1,15-Jul-19,5,"my mothers favorite I bought this as a gift as its my mothers favorite scent. bought it for Christmas, Mothers day and her birthday. she says they were fresh with long scent and burned to the very bottom."
1,4-Jan-19,5,"GREAT gift Purchased this as a ""hostess gift"" for the Christmas holiday - they LOVED it!  The house smelled wonderful & it looks like it will last a long time (it only burned for 3 hours & melted minimally).  I'll be buying another for myself!"
1,17-Feb-20,5,Bringing a little of the outside in You can‚Äôt go wrong with this smell it‚Äôs fresh just like the forest but not overpowering. Freshens up a room with a clean forest sent
1,25-Dec-19,1,Bad purchase Very weak smell this candle purchase made me take the leap and just buy a Scentsy burns uneven even after burning it for 10 hours each use. You can‚Äôt even smell the scent in the candle.
1,12-Jan-19,5,"The Scent truly brought back memories!!! What a lovely candle for those who remember having a bayberry candle burning over the holidays.  This is the candle for you!!  I surprised my best friend with it this year, and she burned it the entire season.  I had to get another one for my mom and she was thrilled.  Thank you for keeping this scent!!  Will buy it again."
1,11-Dec-19,1,Smells like nothing I gave this one star because I was able to light it but it smells like nothing what a waste of money .
1,12-May-19,4,Changed Think these candles have changed over the years. Not as strongly scented as in years gone by.
1,30-Nov-19,1,"Disappointed. No scent I love Yankee Candles. Howver, this particular candle has not much scent. That is why you spend more for candles is the scent is more prominent. Disappointed is an understatement."
1,1-Nov-16,5,"Rich Buttery Goodness I purchase this particular scent a lot, it's my mom's very favorite.  When I walk into my parent's house, I don't smell their dogs, last night's dinner, or even the coffee they have brewing.  I'm smacked in the face with a wall of this strong sugar cookie scent and it is wonderful.  The candles seem to last forever (or a few months until I buy her a new one).  They have a single wick which I personally prefer, as it increases the burn time, and the scent is really strong even with a single wick.I do agree that the rim of the candle can become coated in soot, and the candle is so large it's difficult to reach all the way in to light it without getting soot on your hand.  A BBQ lighter or long match solves both those problems."
1,6-Nov-20,5,Yummy I got this scent for the holidays has my apartment smelling so good
1,21-Feb-20,5,Lovely smell. Uneven burning. Lovely scent! Is not burning evenly anymore though which is annoying. Uneven wax ring around candle. But the smell is outstanding!
1,13-Dec-19,5,Fresh cut tree scent I love the fresh scent of pine during thee holidays.  We have artificial trees so these candles provide you with the illusion of a freshly cut tree.
1,2-Oct-20,5,Beautiful fragrance Love the candle the fragrance is amazing and lasts a long time... will definitely buy again ...
1,29-Nov-19,5,"Good smells Smells great, haven‚Äôt burnt through my first one yet, so I can‚Äôt comment on longevity. Will update this review when I‚Äôve burnt through the whole candle."
1,3-Dec-18,1,No scent! I haven‚Äôt bought a Yankee Candle in awhile and now I remember why- there‚Äôs no scent! I‚Äôm going back to the Bath and Bodyworks  candles.
1,4-Dec-19,5,Wonderful Smell! The scent is phenomenal and lasts a good while. I always get compliments on the smell even when its not the holidays!  Love it! I will purchase again!
1,12-Apr-20,1,"Barely a faint odor Something isn't right. I bought 3 large candles,  all the same apple scent, burning at the same time in my house- for 12 hours- and I can barely smell them. When I put my face directly over the candle it just smells like melty wax. I won't buy ""Yankee Candles"" on Amazon again."
1,6-Feb-20,4,Yankee Candle The smell is very pleasant. The color perfectly matches the room I sat it in. Since it is a YC it burns slower than other brands.
1,20-Nov-20,5,Smells wonderful It does last a while and the smell is all the way to the bottom
1,20-Nov-19,5,Does what it says It smells like a Christmas tree
1,15-Jul-20,5,Christmas is alive. Smells like Christmas. Fake tree but want the live trees scent... This candle will do it.
1,15-Dec-18,3,Love Yankee Candles I love Yankee Candles and use them all the time.  This one was a bit pricey.  I am disappointed in that the scent is so light.  Likely will not buy again and stick with sparkling cinnamon and balsam & cedar for the holidays
1,23-Nov-19,5,Buy and enjoy Lovely scent. No icky smelling soy wax but real candle wax and essential oils. Longer lasting than other candles which pays for the extra cost.
1,17-Mar-18,5,"Great Candle, super fragrance I love Yankee Candle and their evergreen type candles.I have tried several times to purchase from the Yankee Candle catalogue, however, they keep trying to add unwanted candles to the purchases.Now that I know I can purchase just what I want thru Amazon, GREAT!!!!"
1,4-Jun-20,5,Worth to buy The fragrance of Balsam & Cedar is very fresh but  too pricy.  I bought few large jar of $11.
1,27-Dec-18,1,Wont burn Four of the last five Yankee candles that I have bought have burned for 30-45 minutes. They then self-extinguish and will not relight. I am finished with Yankee CandleFor the high price they are not worth it.
1,9-Jan-20,5,Was better than other review I read It covers up bad smells well. It fact it smells quite good. It sets the mood every morning and appears to be very long lasting.
1,8-Mar-20,5,Love yankee This and the blue spruce are my favorite fragrance.- love yankee ‚ÄºÔ?è
1,16-Feb-19,5,"Good buy. Bought as gift, came wrapped in box nicely. You can tell the candle is older or maybe stored in heat? because there were oil spots on the surface but it still smelt good when burned."
1,19-Jan-19,1,"Broken heart candle My favorite candle arrived broken. Now the price is 2xs as much.  No replacement.  I am sad that it took so long to send me shattered glass in a great cedar smelling box.  Oooo, my heart just fluttered again!"
1,3-Oct-20,5,Love this candle. Great scent of evergreens. Perfect at Christmas. I would recommend. Wonderful scent! It lasts a long time. I plan to buy more. Love Yankee Candles
1,18-Oct-20,1,NO SCENT! I bought the Candy Apple and there is no scent at all! Sent back
1,20-Jan-20,5,"Nice pine scent Perfect for Christmas, it had a pleasant pine scent. I liked it so much I bought a second one.  The double wick helped this candle burn evenly."
1,2-Dec-19,4,"Nice packaging. Good quality. Arrived packaged very well. Looks like the candle I remember from years past, but not as strong as I remember it being. Still lovely."
1,11-May-20,5,MELTED Good thing we like the smell because that‚Äôs all we can smell in the house since delivery a couple hours ago. Candle a little melted/messy.
1,10-Dec-18,1,No scent at all These were no doubt on sale because they must have been sitting in a warehouse these last 20 years.  That's they only way they could be so dusty and non scented!  Burned this half way down before I finally tossed it. No discernible scent whateoever.
1,29-Nov-19,1,Broken candle This is the 3rd broken candle I have received. Shipping box is fine with shattered candle. Glass all over. I will not order another candle again. Terrible.
1,12-Jan-20,5,Nicely scented Perfect gift. Scent is wonderful but doesn‚Äôt remain very long. Which may be a good or bad thing depending on what you want
1,18-Jan-20,5,Love it!! Love this candle!! Great for specially Christmas time! But it's so refreshing I'm using it every time I'm staying home!!
1,12-Jan-20,5,Smells like a fresh Christmas tree! These smell just like a Christmas tree. It lasts about a week and makes the whole apartment smell like I chopped down a fresh tree.
1,31-Dec-18,1,"Di I expected a lot more from Yankee Candle. I have bought Yankee Candles for years, and find very few that I don't like. This one was to fill the room during the Christmas time while the tree was up. The smell was not what I was expecting."
1,7-Jan-20,5,"Very nice candle Quick shipping and came in well wrapped, no breakage. Great Christmas candle and such a sweet scent, not fake like most."
1,20-Nov-19,5,Pine fresh Great pine fresh
1,3-Nov-19,5,Favorite Christmas scent! I love this for Christmas holidays
1,31-Jan-20,5,Atmospheric scent My husband surprised me with 2 of these for the holidays and we love them!  The scent makes the holidays more festive!
1,2-Jun-18,5,"Oh man does this smell good.. Oh man does this smell good... It makes it perfectly acceptable to NOT bake cookies during the holidays, but instead just burn this thing and make your guests THINK you've made them cookies. They will thank you for the smell and it is less calories."
1,16-Dec-19,5,What fake tree? Lol. This is a great smelling Christmas tree scent. Great brand. You simply MUST have a Christmas tree scented candle in your house if you have a fake tree. This one is great!
1,7-Jan-20,3,THE SCENT DOESN'T SEEM THE SAME - NOT AS STRONG I had this candle last year.  This one doesn't smell exactly the same nor is it as strong.  I do like it however.  It burns the same.
1,9-Feb-20,5,"Love my balsam and cedar! This is my favorite scent that Yankee makes. It makes your house smell like Christmas greenery for those of us who don‚Äôt use real trees.  It‚Äôs not too strong, but has good scent.  I gifted my 4 adult kids with one for Christmas and I am using my second this season. You have to try it!"
1,2-Jul-15,1,"Appears to be a fake. Smells like a dollar store candle I have been buying Yankee candles for 20 years. Ordered 2 Yankee candles and both came today. This particular one ""Christmas Cookie"" appears to be a fake! I'm 99% positive. The bottom of the jar doesn't have the ""normal"" Yankee candle sticker. Also it smells like a cheap vanilla sent from the dollar store. There is very little smell. You can also tell that it was poured very smoothly. Yankee candles are not smooth like that and have waxy oily fragrant bubbles in them! I have never been so disappointed. Definitely will never order from this seller again. I paid way to much money for this candle, for it to smell so cheap! I know what Christmas cookies Yankee candles smell like and this isn't it!!! I'm a stay at home mom so I don't get out often but lesson learned. So so disappointed! :("
1,2-Jun-18,5,"Yep, gorgeous scent, this one. Some combination ... Yep, gorgeous scent, this one. Some combination of this one, the Christmas Cookie scent, and the Cinnamon scent, really, you're set for the holidays. You don't need to buy anyone gifts. They will thank you for the smells wafting into their noses."
1,16-Dec-16,5,"Essential for changing the atmosphere of the room you're in. No matter where I am, I've found that having a candle in the room really changes the environment. If you want the scent of the holidays in the air, this balsam and cedar candle is absolutely perfect for that. I like to light it and have it burning while I do computer work, and it helps with focus and serenity and all that. The jar is sizable and will burn for hours. The lid has a plastic stopper which helps to keep it sealed- and if you live in an apartment with hyper-vigilant smoke detectors, the stopper helps because you can extinguish the candle by putting the lid on it, and no smoke is released to the air. One of the complaints I used to have about Yankee Candles was that the middle of the wick area would burn downward, but the remainder of the candle would stay up at the top. The way to prevent this is to burn the candle long enough that it melts all of the top level surface of wax, so it distributes evenly when you are finished. Yankee candles are classy and interesting, and while I've had other candle brands, I keep coming back to Yankee for its aromas and high quality (i.e. evenly melting wax)."
1,22-Dec-19,5,Wonderful scent! This candle gives off a wonderful clean scent that fills the first floor of my house!  This has quickly become one of my favorites!
1,19-Dec-19,5,Ok candle scent. I got this on sale for $10.00Not bad for the price. But I wouldn't pay regular price for it. The scent is very mild.
1,2-Feb-17,5,"Really soothing.  The stress just melts away... who knew a candle could give you a hug? As soon as I got this, I pulled off the lid, hid the label and asked my co-worker to smell it and try to guess the aroma.  Without hesitation he said: ""Sugar Cookies"".  I showed him the label and said: ""OMG, look at the picture and tell me those aren't sugar cookies!""  I got it home, turned off my phone, fired it up, and within 20 minutes my condo smelled amazing.  It didn't make me hungry, just very relaxed and very calm."
1,8-Dec-18,4,"good candle good price was worried it wouldn't smell the way I wanted, ie like a Christmas tree, or a pine tree. And while its not an exact match, it's good, a bit faint, but the opposite would be worse. Just right and a good price."
1,21-Dec-19,5,Smells Amazing!! Originally I bought this as a gift but I liked the smell so much I bought one for myself. This candle smells amazing!
1,24-Dec-19,1,Had no scent whatsoever. Would give 0 star if i could This candle had NO scent whatsoever. Burned it twice for over an hour and did not scent the room at all.  Very disappointing since this is a Yankee Candle.
1,10-Feb-20,5,"Great candle, great price I always give Yankee candles as Christmas gifts.  There was a sale on this Christmas scent, great deal!"

I left this candle on for hours on end!! adding an amazing pleasant smell to all my home.

1,19-Apr-20,5,Great! Packaged well and was everything I expected!
1,19-Dec-14,4,"Would have loved to give 5 stars, but . . . Would have loved to give 5 stars but jar arrived (though very much on time) with a broken glass top --- that could have been quite dangerous. The actual wrapping was very good. But I think this happened because the lid was not tightened down, taped, to the candle jar top, and the shipping was too much of a strain.I love this aroma at Christmastime and have a deep, slender Christmas bucket, so kept the candle, and  am burning it safely. The aroma is perfect! I use Amazon a lot, and for years, and this is only the 2nd time I have been tempted to return, but I was more tempted to make do and have this lovely aroma in the house for our holiday festivities."
1,4-Nov-16,2,The candle came in in peaces! Package was full ... The candle came in in peaces! Package was full of broken glass I didn't even open the package for safety. I''m returning it. It's unusuable!

1,27-Feb-20,5,Good price! Great smell and great price. I looked for awhile to find a candle with this scent that wasn't an outrageous price and I finally found one! Would get again for sure!
1,2-Jul-15,5,"One of my favorite scents. Lasts for well over 100 hours A huge candle fan. This candle cost 25% less than at the Yankee store and since it's a seasonal item, it wasn't available at the Yankee store this time of year. One of my favorite scents.Lasts for well over 100 hours."

1,2-May-19,5,"True to scent True to scent, it‚Äôs become my favorite."

1,10-Dec-15,3,"The good with the bad... I bought this as a gift, and was really excited to get it. It's not my favorite scent, but my friend is going to be really happy to get it.

1,25-Feb-16,3,"It is appreciated It's an OK candle. It was a bit expensive for what you get, however, that was expected with the company name. Given as a gift and it is appreciated. The scent isn't overpowering which is why I went with this company - they put reasonable amounts of scents in their candles."

1,3-Dec-19,1,Horrible. Terrible. Not real. I have purchased many Yankee candles and 5-6 that are this same scent. This candle arrived looking dried out and crusty. The smell is minimal and it doesn‚Äôt burn as cleanly as a normal Yankee candle.

1,18-Jan-20,5,Heaven Smelled wonderful at an awesome price
1,9-Jan-18,5,the smell was good and its a yankee candle so you already know 10.99 for a Yankee candle you can't beat that and this smell is also pretty damn good imo one of my friends didn't approve and said it smelled too sweet but luckily i bought it & not him lol
1,8-Feb-20,5,Love the scent! Terrific! Smells like I‚Äôve been baking cookies all day long.
1,11-Feb-20,5,"Smells wonderful! Gave as a gift, she loved it!"

I‚Äôm not even exaggerating. I hope, for your sake, that it was a bad batch... but I probably won‚Äôt be trying again.  Brightside: It didn‚Äôt give me a headache...:)"
1,6-Feb-20,5,The real thing Yankee candles are long lasting and fragrant. Super protective package. The real thing at 1/3 the price
1,5-Mar-20,4,Great for the holidays! Great for the holidays.
1,8-Jan-20,4,Yankee candles will always be great. Love the quality. But not the old style jar.
1,8-Dec-17,1,Hardly any Scent Very Little scent.  I wonder if these are factory-seconds?  Wax looks like it was poured badly. Lots of voids and inconsistent mix.
1,1-Jan-19,5,Smells great! It‚Äôs a good candle ! Super expensive though for just a candle. Arrived in perfect condition though and smells great !
1,16-May-13,3,"Faint but good smell I like the fresh, outdoorsy scent of this candle.  I just wish it was stronger.  Usually I find that Yankee candles are pretty potent, so maybe the candle I got was from a weakly scented batch of wax, or maybe it's just this scent.  I still enjoy it, it just is kind of hard to notice unless you have just walked into the room or are right next to the candle."
1,1-Jan-20,4,Good purchase Long lasting!Great scent!
1,27-Dec-19,2,Smells like playdoh! Smells like playdoh to me with a hint of sugar.
1,1-Dec-19,4,Ordinary Smell good but not strong. Ordinary candle.

1,14-Apr-17,1,"Couldn't smell it at all. Very disappointed, as it doesn't put out any scent at all.  Not the same quality I come to expect from Yankee Candle."
1,15-Feb-20,5,Candle candle candle candle The person I bought it for really enjoyed it or so she said
1,5-May-20,5,GREAT GREAT
1,20-Nov-13,2,"scent is too sweet for my taste I am sure this is a very high quality candle in terms of staying power, but it's just too sweet smelling for me. I wanted a nice, mild, piney scent for the holiday season. This candle is definitely piney, but the aroma is too potent for me. I can only leave it on for about 30 minutes and then I start to feel kind of nauseated from the sweet fumes. I definitely think this has a sweeter scent than other pine-scented candles I've had, so if you're into that, then this may work for you. If sugary sweet aromas make you feel ill, then beware. In retrospect, it's clearly a mistake to order a scented candle online, as I think I would have been able to tell right away in person that this wouldn't work for me. Works fine for lots of people though--just depends on what you like! I've burned it a few nights now and it's barely burned down at all, so I'd say it's very well made, as one would expect of a Yankee candle."
1,13-Feb-20,5,Candle I love it! Great price!
1,5-Feb-20,4,Lasting fragrance Didn't  fragrance last very long. Not as good as other Yankee candles I have had.

1,4-Apr-20,5,Good price!!! Smells good.
1,4-Jan-18,4,Not a strong scent vs store bought This is one of my favorite scents but I feel the candles I purchase online vs in store are not nearly as strong scented. Still worked and I got them on sale so can't really complain.
1,5-Feb-20,5,Great candle Excellent scent for those who want some piney fragrance
1,15-Dec-19,5,Nice holiday scent Great candle smells like Christmas

1,9-Jan-20,5,Mmmm Smells like a Christmas tree
1,15-Feb-17,5,Seasonally perfect This was our first year using a fake Christmas Tree.  The scent had a perfect fir smell that traveled throughout the house.  Yankee candles last so much longer than other candles.  this candle burned clean and even.  Great product.
1,3-Mar-20,5,Yankee candle large jar Christmas cookies Nice smell.
1,16-Jun-14,5,"This is by far, my very, very favorite Yankee Candle I only buy Yankee Candles... yes they are more expensive, but you get what you pay for. They last longer and smell wonderful. A friend of mine had a candle burning at her house one Christmas. When we walked into her hallway it smelled like a candy cane... I asked her what that wonderful smell was and she showed me the North Pole Yankee Candle.. I was hooked from that moment. I can't tell you how many of these candles I have purchased from Amazon.com and have given to family and friends as gifts. Amazons prices are a little less than what I would get in a regular store and anyway, I can't find North Pole in any store in my area anymore. Some candles are sickingly sweet or very strong.. this one is perfect and doesn't assult the senses.You will love, love it...Christine C. Schubert"
1,13-Jun-15,5,"Delicious Scent Purchased two as Christmas gifts last season and both recipients were pleased.  Yankee candles set the standard that all other candlemakers aspire to achieve.  The scents are enveloping and strikingly realistic.  These are addictively easy to collect and enjoy, but pricey."
1,17-Jan-16,5,"Very pleased. I purchased the large 2 wick Balsam and Cedar.  It arrived 2 days ago, and so far I haven't even had to light it.  Just leaving the cover off the jar allows a gentle scent to escape.  Wish now that I had ordered more when they were on sale"
1,5-Dec-19,5,Love Smells so light and amazing.
1,19-Feb-20,5,Bargain Great price! Scent is heavenly

1,26-Dec-17,5,You can't go wrong with a Yankee Candle Yankee Candles are the best.  I just wish bayberry and hollyberry were not so hard to find.  As always the candle burns slowly and fills the house with a wonderful fragrance.

1,6-Dec-17,3,"The sent is perfect and very realistic but the wick does not hold ... With that candle, I have the same problem as with the Balsam. The sent is perfect and very realistic but the wick does not hold long. After a few hours, the wick would drown in the liquid part of the candle. And there is only one wick instead of two like before in that type of big candles so it's not helping either."
1,9-Jan-15,5,This is my favorite candle at Christmas This is my favorite candle at Christmas. I have an artificial tree so I burn this candle near by to give off the effect of a live tree. I like it better than a traditional evergreen smelling candle. I buy one every year . Burns for a while. I get a good couple of weeks out of the candle. I do burn for long periods of time

1,12-Mar-14,5,Yankee Christmas Wreath 22-Ounce Jar Candle My wife and I enjoy the Yankee Candles. They are superior to other candles that you can buy in that they will fill the room with the scent.

1,27-Feb-17,5,Very pleased with purchase Great price in the off-season of Holiday scents. Happy with price and product.
1,19-Feb-11,5,"I love this smell -- cookies baking in the oven. This is a much faster way of getting Yankee candles than from the Yankee candle website.  I burn this candle in the kitchen so it smells like cookies baking.  MMmmmm.  These tumbler type containers (it is not the ""jar"") with two wicks burns a lot more evenly that the jar."
1,26-Feb-17,5,I love Yankee Candles I love Yankee Candles! This one is perfect for when we use our artificial Christmas tree. Makes it smell like we have a real tree!
1,31-Dec-17,2,Where's the pine? This should have made my living room smell like a fresh cut Christmas tree. It didn't. Scent is too weak not pine-y enough... more perfume than balsam.

1,28-Aug-13,5,"My boyfriend loves it! He's very pleased with the scent - loves it! Would buy again and recommend it to others. I can't comment on how long the candle burns because he just started it, but he is very particular about scents and really liked this one."
1,29-Nov-17,4,Formula? Bought 3 of these as I have loved the smell from previous years when burning. Not sure if my sniffer has changed or the candle formula but seems different. I still like them but smell seems stronger.
1,4-Jun-16,5,My favorite Yankee Candle My favorite of all Yankee Candles.  It's not just for the holidays. I live in the country and use it all year around. It makes our house smell like pine needles.
1,6-Jan-20,5,MY FAVORITE BEST SCENT EVER
1,15-Dec-19,5,Great Great.
1,4-Jan-20,5,The BEST! Love Yankee!
1,30-Dec-15,3,My candle has very little smell. These just don't put out much smell at all. I have seen quite a few complaints about various Yankee Holiday candles in the jar being very weak. What it does put out is really nice. With Yankee Candle you apparently need at least a 2 wick version. This limits the life a the candle. As such I won't be buying any more single wick candles and moving more toward Woodwick.Follow-up- I see someone didn't find my review helpful. Not sure how I can be more informative although that is mine & many others opinion. I purchased another similar Yankee this holiday season & it again has very little scent compared to the Woodwick Balsam Fir. No comparison in really. I mailed out Woodwick's this holiday season. No more Yankee's for me.
1,14-Nov-16,5,Five Stars I love this candle it reminds me of Christmas
1,2-Feb-20,5,Smell of Christmas My favorite Yankee Candle scent!

1,21-Dec-12,5,"Love!! I love the smell of this candle. I have had other scents that were similar and I couldn't smell them through the house and this one I can. If you like this kind of scent, I would recommend this. It has a very nice Christmas scent to it, makes the house smell sooo good."
1,4-Feb-19,5,"Great product Smells amazing (not overly piney), and burned evenly down to the end. Just ordered a second one!"

1,9-May-17,5,Nice Great as always always enjoy these candles have nothing else to say so blah blah blah blah blah blah. Blah
1,4-Dec-17,1,bad candle The candle is damaged. It looks like it had been maybe  in a hot place. The top of full of bubbles and inside the jar there is wax that has separated.
1,22-Aug-13,5,Smells like Christmas! This candle is great. I burn it most frequently in the fall/winter during football games. The men prefer it because of the woodsy smell it gives off. It smells fresh and this size lasts me through the whole season.
1,11-Nov-17,5,Five Stars nice candle
1,16-Jan-14,4,"Takes long for aroma I just received my candle and immediately lit it.  It was burning for about an hour and a half and still no smell, even when I get my nose close to the candle I don't smell very much. I blew it out and I'm going to relight it later.  A friend told me that sometimes the candles are old and they won't smell as much I don't know if that's true and how do you know if it's old???I must have been mistaken but I thought Yankee candles come with three wicks, maybe they have a larger one, guess I have to check it out.Hopefully when I relight it I will get the aroma Yankee candles are known for."
1,8-Jan-18,5,Brings Christmas to your room. It's a Yankee candle. It smells great. What else needs to be said?

1,4-Jan-17,5,"The perfect candle for the holidays The perfect candle for the holidays.  The wonderful balsam scent and long lasting, slow burn made this a great candle to light everyday throughout our holiday season.  I will certainly purchase another one next year along with a cinnamon scented one to compliment this one."

1,3-Aug-17,4,"Thumbs Up Not quite what I was hoping for. A little too ""perfumey"". but overall, I enjoy it."
1,10-Jan-17,5,"My winter favorite One of my favorites from Yankee Candle, this clean piney candle is a staple in my home all winter. Fills the house with scent."
1,29-Jan-14,5,MAKE YOUR HOUSE SMELL LIKE YOU BAKED WITHOUT BAKING!!! I bought this because I walked into somebody's house and smelt freshly baked amazing cookies to find out they were burning this candle. Now I have it in my home :) It literally smells like sugar cookies!!
1,8-Jan-18,5,Five Stars It made my house smell like we had at least one Christmas tree up. Nice.
1,27-Oct-18,5,Great Caandles Always great.

1,21-Dec-18,5,Great smell Smell great
1,25-Dec-13,5,"Wonderful Scent This is my daughter's favorite holiday scent.  It fills one small room, with average height ceiling.I question the value of ordering the largest size since it's hard to burn all of it, but the aroma is elegant."
1,5-Sep-18,5,Great Scent Always a winner
1,13-Feb-19,5,Smells wonderful Love this candle !

1,18-Sep-17,5,Five Stars smells great
1,13-Jan-14,5,"Part of my family's holiday tradition We've tried every Yankee pine scented candle and this one is everyone's favorite (by a wide margin).  It's the balsam that sets this apart.  You may have heard of Balm of Gilead (it is mentioned in the Bible).  That's made from balsam, and balsam has been a highly prized fragrance for eons.  The pine scent does not resemble the smell of cedar boards - it's more like douglas fir.  One candle will give a fresh scent to a large living/dining area and adjoining kitchen, and last at least four weeks of fairly regular use. This is always part of my family's holiday tradition."
1,14-Jan-18,5,Five Stars I love this this candle.  It was exactly what I had hoped it would be and love the scent!
1,30-Apr-18,5,Five Stars Smell just like the one in the store
1,22-Nov-15,2,Disappointing This candle has a pleasant scent but did not fill the tiny space (similar in size to a dorm room). I love Yankee Candle and have come to expect much better quality for the price.
1,10-Jan-19,5,Love this scent Love this scent!
1,29-Jun-17,3,Smells good... wick problem Love this scent... problem is there is something wrong with the wick.  It wont stay light and when lit all it does is pop and crackle...
1,20-Nov-13,4,nice scent and candle I will start off by saying that there is a good reason why these candles are expensive. They produce a wonderful smell that fills the room up pretty quickly. They also seem to burn they smoothly and evenly.
1,5-Nov-15,5,Smells Heavenly I bought it to burn in December once it gets chilly .  However it smells exactly like a pine tree and I have not even burn it - so I would give it a 5 stars!!!
1,15-Feb-18,5,Five Stars Smells yummy! Will purchase again if on sale.
1,27-Jan-15,4,"Lovely natural bayberry scent Nice true bayberry scent which is harder to find these days. I am somewhat concerned about how the candle will work in the jar as it burns down, but this has not been a problem so far."
1,19-Dec-17,1,Sub-par and low quality for a Yankee Candle I don't recommend this item.  It lasted just over one week with nightly use.  This is far below the quality of Yankee Candles I've purchased elsewhere.  I seems like just a cheap glass carafe with a Yankee Candle sticker on the outside.
1,2-Dec-16,5,Loved This Seasonal Candle LOVE THIS FRAGRANCE!!!! I buy a lot of Brand Named High End Candles but I always seem to come back to Yankee ...
1,13-Feb-18,5,Five Stars Still the best candles after all these years
1,13-Feb-18,5,"Fills the room with beautiful sent Large and beautiful sent, worth every penny."
1,8-Jan-17,2,"Will not replace Xmas tree smell!!! Bought this when I finally switched to a fake Christmas tree.  Smells ok, but NOT like Christmas tree.  :("
1,31-Dec-17,3,"Three Stars This is one of Yankee Candle's weaker smells, at least for me."
1,1-Apr-18,1,One Star Smell is not good. Is it real one?
1,2-Nov-20,5,Smells like Christmas Smells like Christmas
1,18-Feb-18,5,Five Stars Good quality; good price; quick delivery.
1,25-Feb-15,4,"Nice Candle This Yankee Candle is my wife's Christmas favorite. It smells most like a Christmas treee to us.Yankee's are kind of expensive, but they do seem to be the best quality out there."
1,20-Jan-15,5,Super Smeller Super cookie smelling candle. Mine scent stayed strong. It burned consistently and evenly so long as I cut the wick each time. Got it for a fair price too!
1,18-Aug-12,3,"Decent Woodsy smell This is a strong scent that I use to cover up mild cigarette smoke and a musky attic smell.  I do recommend it but it is not as natural as I was expecting and does smell the same as the old candle smell from the 70's and 80's, which is older (but not bad).  It is the only yankee candle that works immediately however and it lasts longer than the smoke eaters I have tried; and one single wick fills my entire studio apartment.  A nice/newer alternative is yankee's Autumn Leaves which smells similar (but is orange)."
1,27-Feb-15,5,"Smelled like Christmas but not too astringent Smelled like Christmas but not too astringent. It was a great substitute for not having a tree in a limited space. Gave the place a great, cheery smell but without all the pine needles to clean up!"
1,10-Apr-17,5,LOVE LOVE LOVE! Love the smell!  Fills the entire room!  Smells so clean!  Get a lot of compliments when people walk in.
1,13-May-16,5,"My favorite winter scent My favorite winter scent, smells like Christmas trees or a walk in a pine forest, this Yankee Candle burns a long time and fills your home with scent"
1,14-Dec-19,3,Weak Scent I'm disappointed in the weak scent..burned candle as recommended.

1,2-Feb-19,5,AMAZING I loveeee this sent and at the price you can‚Äôt go wrong makes the house smell super
1,12-Jan-13,5,smells like a real tree in  your house I don't get real trees anymore.  I just light the candle and within a short time the whole house smells like I am in a pine forest.  I absolutely love it.  Just makes the holidays a bit brighter.
1,30-Dec-19,5,Perfect for the Holidays High quality candles with a great scent.
1,1-Jan-19,5,Love it! Great price and smells great!
1,16-Mar-18,5,Five Stars if you have never smelled this scent - you have t get it!!
1,14-Jan-17,3,Three Stars Very nice but the fragrance requires confined areas and small rooms to make a difference.
1,7-Dec-12,5,"Love Yankee Candles I usually buy candles from the Yankee store at the mall but I moved to NYC a couple of years ago and I hate shopping here and I am sure I wouldn't be able to find these candles here in NYC.  Super fast shipping and excellent packaging.  Item as described and pictured.  I have been buying Yankee candles for years and I ONLY buy yankee candles.  They all smell WONDERFUL.  No other scented candle comes close to Yankee candles.  As soon as you light the candle it immediately starts to scent the room(s).  I only burn the candle for about 1 hour at a time and the scent stays in the room for quite some time.  Make sure you keep the wick cut short before you the light the candle.  This helps the candle to burn more efficiently and prevents black smoke burn-off.  This candle is perfect for people who have fake christmas trees because it smells just like a real tree, if not better than a real tree.  All of their scents are fantastic!  I highly recommend and I will be buying more in the future."
1,6-Jan-15,5,Wonderful for the holiday Cant really go wrong with Yankee. This scent was everything we expected. Wonderful for the holiday. I bought it as a gift to a good friend and she absolutely loved it!
1,12-Jan-17,5,This candle smells amazing. Use at my son's store and it makes ... This candle smells amazing.  Use at my son's store and it makes the place smell so good.
1,29-Nov-16,5,"All-Time Favorite! Christmas Cookie is a very subtle scent that smells like fresh sugar cookies baking in the oven. It's one of my all-time favorite candle scents from Yankee Candle. I actually burn Christmas Cookie scented candles all year long in my house! For some variety, I switch up the one I burn in the kitchen to McIntosh Apple or Buttercream, the other scents that I love. The reason I choose Yankee Candle over other brands is that they last longer and the fragrance is not overwhelming. Since they last longer, I can burn them for hours at a time and enjoy every minute! Now the scented Yankee Candles come in a variety of containers and sizes that appeal to all ages & decorating styles!"
1,31-Jan-18,1,Waste of money Came broken. Waste of money.
1,18-Jul-16,5,"Love the candle Love the candle,love the scent.It was well wrapped and I had no problems with it.I will order from them again!"

1,20-Jan-14,5,Wonderful smell! I've used Yankee Candles for years.  This scent is one of my favorites.  It has a beautiful pine smell that fills the house.  I burn it for hours each day and they last for a long time.
1,22-Oct-12,5,Candles aglow !! I love Yankee candles !!  I was happy to find the Christmas sugar cookie scent without waiting until the holidays.  My husband commented that he wished there were cookies in the oven instead of only the scent making him hungry
1,10-Dec-16,5,I just love this smell In my opinion this is the best smelling candle sold at Christmas time.  A favorite of mine!
1,20-Mar-18,5,"Love the fragrant for this candle I only use Yankee Candles, Love the fragrant for this candle."

1,3-Mar-15,3,"If you want a real bayberry scent, this isn't the one. I love the smell of real bayberry candles and this isn't very close to that.  This smells more like it's trying to smell like a pine tree or pine cleaner.  I wasn't too thrilled with that.  I should have known because of the word ""holiday"" in the name.  I do with YC would make a candle that smelled like real bayberry.  I gave it 3 stars because it is a quality candle but I'm disappointed in the scent.  That will teach me to buy a scented candle in person and not online!"

1,13-Jan-12,5,Live Christmas Tree in the House Buy this candle if you want the fragrance of a Christmas tree in your home. I was plesantly surprised by this wonderful candle. My daughter recommended it. Definitely should be part of your yankee candle collection.

1,27-Dec-16,5,Smells like Christmas! Filled our home with a lovely scent.
1,11-Mar-17,3,"Overrated and Overpriced Yankee Candles in my opinion are overrated and overpriced.  I ordered one of the larger size along with three of the same size Village Candles.  The Yankee Candle did not come in its own custom box as did the Village candle.  In addition, the single wick does not burn as efficiently and cleanly as the Village Candle.  I am glad I found an alternative."
1,3-Jan-17,5,"BEST smelling candle! Delicious smelling candle, burns well - would buy again & again!"
1,20-Feb-15,4,"Happy with purchase nice scent, perfect size for the Yankee Candle shade."

1,26-Aug-16,5,Five Stars Smells so good. I loved it.
1,28-Jan-18,5,"Great vanilla scent! I bought this for $10.99!  What a steal!  I use Warm Luxe Cashmere as my plugin air freshener.  Christmas Cookie enhances that vanilla tone and makes the house smell wonderful.  It's a different kind of vanilla smell, unlike those cheap candles and air fresheners.  It just smells so good!  Will definitely buy again!"
1,13-Jan-15,5,Five Stars Cheaper here than anywhere else that Yankee Candles are carried! Smells delicious!
1,13-May-17,5,"Christmas Cookie is my favorite scent in Yankee candle! Christmas Cookie is my favorite scent in this Yankee candle! Not too vanilla-ee, nor too strong a scent. Just love it. I light the candle for at least 2 hours a day. It's enough to keep the scent around for the rest of the day. Has lasted me awhile. No problems with the wick. I have this on subscribe and save here on Amazon."
1,16-Dec-16,5,Five Stars Very nice packing and the quality of this candle is great.
1,10-Nov-14,5,Five Stars Love the smell

1,12-May-15,1,One Star Does not smell like s fir tree
1,2-Jan-15,3,Not a strong scent I didn't think it smelled stron enough.
1,8-Mar-17,1,"never again Yankee candles are not what they used to be. Barely any scent and wicks that burn soot into the air no matter if it is trimmed. Terrible quality! I used to love these, but this was my LAST purchase."
1,25-Dec-15,5,Five Stars Great
1,22-Nov-15,5,"Five Stars My favorite winter scent, reminds me of a Christmas tree."
1,13-Dec-17,3,Three Stars it seemed a little old

1,28-Nov-14,5,Five Stars Odorly dandy.
1,11-Dec-15,5,Great Candles I love Yankee Candles and being able to buy them on amazon is great.  The candles have a great long lasting fragence.
1,23-Dec-16,3,"Skimpy scent Great price but I am disappointed with the amount of scent. I had a Colonial candle, also a tree scent, and it was so powerful it made my whole kitchen and family room smell like a freshly cut Christmas tree. I bought two of the Yankee candles when the Colonial candle was running out  and I ended up needing them both.  I was going to use one as a gift but I needed it and still don't get the same level of scent.Not sure if these were a special Amazon purchase, but the money I saved would have better used with a Colonial or wait until after Christmas and buy the candles 1/2 at Yankee. Don't remember where I got the other candle or the cost but I may be a convert to Colonial."
1,26-Dec-15,1,"it would be a good candle. No way Don't buy this candle.  I have to put my nose up to the candle to smell it.  Had to blow it out because people would bend over the flame to smell the fragrance and I was afraid their hair would catch on fire.  I thought it was a brand name, therefore, it would be a good candle.  No way... I would hesitate to buy any candle by this brand."
1,28-Jan-15,4,Four Stars Lasts and smells great
1,23-Mar-17,3,Three Stars Not that strong.
1,2-Dec-14,5,Five Stars Loved the smell. Fills the whole house.
1,18-Feb-15,5,Five Stars Can't go wrong with Yankee Candle. I always purchase their holiday ones since it reminds me of my childhood.
1,22-Feb-15,5,"Five Stars Wonderful, just like I remembered.  Strong and perfect."
1,4-Dec-17,1,No discernable scent .......would not recommend. Save your money and buy a Yankee candle that actually emits some sort of fragrance.  I was expecting at least a forestry pine/evergreen smell but all I seem to have is nothing!  Soooooo disappointing. Waste of money!  Yankee Candles aren't the reputable product they used to be.
1,15-Jan-17,1,One Star It was cracked when it arrived.
1,8-Nov-12,5,"Amazing candle This candle is a Christmas must for me every year, and I was so excited that I could buy it online!  Usually I have a hard time finding it.  Great product and great company!"
1,8-Feb-15,5,Five Stars love the smell
1,18-Nov-16,5,"Great! When I got this I smelled the candle immediately and it was CRAZY strong, but I have it lit right now and it isn't overpowering at all. I was initially bummed about having to hide it in a corner of my house due to the strength of it, but I guess once it's lit it isn't so strong. I like the scent and I'd purchase it again! Thanks Amazon!"
1,25-Feb-16,5,"Perfect candle for Christmas!! This is my favorite candle scent ever, especially for Christmas!!"
1,8-Feb-17,5,Five Stars Smells like Christmas trees. Wish it would scent more than just one room
1,3-Feb-17,5,"Balsam is awesome, and cedar is neater...an awesome-balsam-cedar-heater! My favorite fragrance and at a great price!"
1,24-Nov-17,5,"like warm butter Smells very strong, like warm butter."
1,3-Jan-16,5,Five Stars Smells great!

1,20-Feb-11,5,"Yankee Candle Got this for my daughter for Christmas she loves Yankee Candles, loves the smell of Christmas.  Came on time and in very good condition."
1,12-Feb-14,5,"Great product! Once again, Yankee Candles and Amazon has come through. This is one of my wifes favorite scents for a candle. Keep up the good work!!!"
1,28-Dec-14,5,"Five Stars Greta product, fast delivery!!!!"
1,6-May-16,1,One Star recieved broken
1,25-Jan-18,1,"... BECAUSE IT WAS A ""YANKEE"" CANDLE KNOWN FOR THEIR AWESOME FRAGRANCE. IT IS MORE LIKE A CHEAP CANDLE ... I PURCHASED THIS CANDLE BECAUSE IT WAS A ""YANKEE"" CANDLE KNOWN FOR THEIR AWESOME FRAGRANCE.  IT IS MORE LIKE A CHEAP CANDLE WITH A YANKEE LABLE ON IT  THERE IS ABSOLUTELY ""NO"" FRAGRANCE FROM THIS CANDLE AT ALL."
1,6-Nov-14,5,Five Stars Was a gift and they loved it.
1,13-Jan-16,3,"Too strong I put up an artificial Christmas tree and missed the tree smell that fills the house. Although this candle definitely smells like a Christmas tree, it's way too strong. I normally love Yankee Candles, and I'd like this one, except that the odor is too overwhelming."
1,17-Dec-12,5,"Favorite Candle! This is absolutely the best smelling candle that Yankee Candle makes.....it always makes our home smell so yummy and warm, will continue to buy more in the future.  Love it!"
1,20-Jan-13,2,"Not Impressed with this Product Yankee Candle has not impressed me at all. They have become a powerful name in the candle industry but there candles are not very good. This candle was suppose to have that  ""christmas tree scent."" I found that the candle emitted a very light(weak) scent and I can barely smell the scent even when putting the candle to my nose. Very disappointed, not a good candle for the price."
1,19-Feb-16,5,My Favorite Smells great year round!
1,16-Dec-15,4,"my home smells like Christmas. Just as expected. Now, my home smells like Christmas."
1,29-Dec-15,5,Five Stars Great! Loved it!

1,22-Feb-15,5,GREAT CHRISTMAS SCENT This is by for my favorite Yankee Candle
1,20-Mar-14,5,"Bliss! I love the fragrance of this candle. As far as I know Yankee has discontinued this candle, so imagine my joy when I found it on your web site.thank you Amazon..."
1,13-Jan-14,2,"It was a bit deformed It was cracky/flakey if that makes sense, and just seemed like a knock-off yankee candle. Still works as a candle but it was not in good shape to give as a gift."
1,27-May-11,5,"Amazong, worth every penny. This candle has been my favorite for as long as I can remember and before that it was (and still is) my mom's favorite. I buy it for her every year. Makes a great gift. The scent is strong and fantastic, makes the whole house smell like fresh baked cookies."
1,5-Dec-14,5,Five Stars smells yummy
1,27-Sep-13,5,"Heaven in a Jar! You can't go wrong with Yankee Candles. They cost so much, I try not to buy them, but the scents are just so good and reliable, that it is worth it! This Balsam Candle is my absolute favorite. I burn it all summer, love the smell of bringing the outdoors in. Everyone comments on my room smelling like Christmas."
1,2-Feb-15,2,Scent lacking! Something wrong...did not have the usual scent that Yankee Candles have.  Buy this scent every year for the holidays.  Had to send this one back.
1,11-Jan-15,4,Its a YANKEE CANDLE it has a great aroma. Just wish it didn't cost so much Its a YANKEE CANDLE it has a great aroma. Just wish it didn't cost so much. This was also a gift. If you are the ultimate candle connoisseur and love the holiday scents I'd recommend this for you. However remember all the smelly fragrances can aggravate asthma or allergies.
1,1-Jan-14,3,"Headline This was going to be my favorite gift to give this year, but It arrived broken and was unable to reorder.  So sad.  The product is good, but the shipping company you used was very unprofessional.  I returned it and gave you all the details, so I'm kind of surpised that you are now asking me if I like it.  Your records should already indicate that I was never able to use it!"
1,5-Dec-14,5,Five Stars Nice large candle and good scent.
1,13-Feb-17,5,Five Stars awesome smell
1,26-Jan-15,3,"Smells good but is overpriced in my opinion Smells good but is overpriced in my opinion. The wife likes it and we only use it at Christmas, so the price becomes more acceptable in that use case."
1,22-Jan-14,2,"Came broken. I bought two candles from the same vendor, and both came poorly packed with the glass smashed into bits. I guess buying candles in glass containers online was a bad idea."
1,6-Oct-14,3,"although I loved pumpkin pie scented candles from Yankee Candle Company although I loved pumpkin pie scented candles from Yankee Candle Company, this one (Christmas Eve) was way too sweet for me. It reminds of candies and lots of them."
1,3-Jan-15,1,disgusting fragrance This fragrance was disgusting.  I have bought many Yankee candles.  Not sure if this was a fluke or reject or if anyone would actually like the scent.  We thought it smelled like a toxic cleaning product. Very disappointed.
1,15-Dec-14,5,"Much better fragrance from Yankee Candle than off brands Much better fragrance from Yankee Candle than off brands, but full retail can be very high unless you find a sale on the scent you like"
1,25-Dec-17,2,"disappointed :( doesn't smell when you burn One of the only Yankee Candles that does't smell nice as you burn it, only when you open the new cap"
1,23-Jan-15,5,Who doesn't love candlelight? Who doesn't love Yankee Candles?  The price was right and the Cinnamon and apple scent is perfect for any time of the year.
1,25-Dec-14,5,"THIS IS PROBABLY ONE OF MY FAVORAITE YANKEE CANDLE FRAGRANCES ... THIS IS PROBABLY ONE OF MY FAVORAITE YANKEE CANDLE FRAGRANCES.  NOT JUST FOR THE HOLIDAYS, BUT EVERY DAY OF THE YEAR."
1,8-Apr-17,5,a great product. but the smells like soap a great product. but the smells like soap. Being a man I did not like it. My wife like it. It burned even only one out of 3 I ordered burned perfect.
1,14-Apr-15,5,Five Stars Great product.
1,23-Jan-17,3,"I only wish It smelled stronger. Doesnt smell as strong as Id like for the price, but it is YUMMY.Most people would enjoy this since strong odors are offensive to many folks."
1,13-Dec-14,5,Five Stars dam ga
1,4-Feb-15,4,Four Stars Not the best product out there for a Christmas smell but it worked
1,29-Nov-16,2,Could barely smell the scent- not the same quality This candle didn't have the strong scent I am used to with Yankee Candles in the past.  The quality isn't the same.
1,8-Dec-16,5,Five Stars Smells like a Christmas tree. I love this scent.
1,5-Jul-16,3,"My Nose says No. I must be the only person on this planet that continually is disappointed by Yankee Candles scents.  Not the scents themselves but the lack of  scents.  I purchase the same size candles, in a cheap no frills name from a local drugstore at a fraction of the price and the smell lingers on and on filling my house with such great scents.  I have yet to get a Yankee Candle that I can smell without standing over it and taking a whiff.  I continue to try and continue to buy yet still the same result every time."
1,21-Dec-15,1,"Arrived shattered Candle arrived with the top broken off/shattered, and jar cracked - not useable, and the broken glass was sharp and dangerous. Not surprising that it broke since it was packed loose inside a too-big box, which was loose inside a larger box. Not worth it to brave the post office lines this time of year to ship it back for a refund or replacement, especially since I wanted to use it for our Christmas party. Very disappointed that it wasn't packaged properly and is now garbage."
1,10-Jun-17,5,Five Stars The perfect smell for Christmas. Subtle and enjoyable. Smells like fresh greens.
1,23-Jan-14,1,"Came broken in a bunch of pieces. This was going to be a Christmas present.  When it arrived it was shattered and unusable.  The packing was poor, so frankly I don't know if the candle would have smelled nice burning.  I'd be very hesitant to order an expensive and heavy Yankee Candle again because of the poor packing.  Glass everywhere."
1,14-Mar-15,3,"Three Stars not much of a smell, kind of dissapointed"
1,10-Dec-15,3,"Wonderful scent, but broken glass jar Now, this is my all time favorite Yankee candle scent.  It smells wonderful and like a real tree.  However, the candle I received was broken.  The glass at the top of the candle jar was shattered.  Since I love the scent, I decided to keep it and put it in a bowl to prevent wax from leaking everywhere.  It just needed to be packaged more securely.  Everyone knows how shipping carriers throw boxes around."
1,1-Mar-15,1,Broken candle Product was broke when I received it. Was not able to give it for a gift. It is still sitting on my counter.
1,14-Dec-17,5,"and I absolutely love the this is my second buy of this particular yankee candle, and I absolutely love the smell"
1,11-Jan-17,5,Five Stars smells so good its almost like eating the fresh
1,13-Dec-14,5,Five Stars thanks!
1,5-Jan-17,5,Five Stars Nice fragrance but need to keep wicks trimmed to avoid smoking
1,9-Dec-17,1,"One Star It smells great, in the box. Arrived broken."
1,17-Apr-16,2,The smell isn't very good The smell isn't very good.
1,16-Mar-15,3,Three Stars The scent is rather faint and not true bayberry
1,27-Mar-17,5,Five Stars love it
1,12-Dec-17,1,One Star Don't waste  money
1,17-Nov-16,5,Five Stars ok
1,12-Feb-17,1,"Very poor packaging It came in microscopic pieces. It was a Christmas present, so I was not happy I had to send it back."
1,23-Mar-18,3,Three Stars ok
1,4-Mar-15,3,Three Stars Smells great but was so very small. Way too much money for its size!
1,13-Feb-17,5,Five Stars Haven't burned yet but it is my favorite scent.  Will enjoy it when it is used.
1,23-Apr-17,5,Five Stars This smells so amazing
1,6-Dec-17,1,"Arrived broken! My candle arrived broken. You can see where the break is. There was no broken glass in the package, therefore, it must have been packed broken!"
1,20-Dec-14,1,Smells like nothing even in the smallest of rooms Smells like nothing even in the smallest of rooms. Obscenely expensive for such low quality. I guess I expected a lot more from a well known product. Cheaper discount scented candles from TJMaxx/Ross have always been better than this. Would not recommend.
1,16-Nov-15,1,Would not recommend. What a rip off Arrived and the glass was shattered all over the top of the candle. Awful! Would not recommend. What a rip off.
1,9-Nov-16,1,One Star I CAME MELTED AND I THREW IT AWAY.
1,31-Mar-14,1,Broken candle Candle came broken
1,22-Dec-17,1,candle smells great and is good sized only problem was when bubble ... candle smells great and is good sized only problem was when bubble wrap removed candle was underneath broken and jarred pieces of glass. I would have really enjoyed the candle tho if it was usable. Was so looking forward to it.
1,7-Feb-15,4,"Just a little weak. Nice candle, but doesn't emit aroma as much as I had hoped for. Still smells nice though."
1,28-Jan-17,5,"Five Stars Perfect! Thank you so much, it will be an excellent Xmas present!!!"
1,4-Jan-16,5,Five Stars Nice fragrance
1,22-Mar-17,5,Five Stars Yummy
1,21-Mar-15,2,not much scent after lighting. This is not the best yankee candle I have had. Limited smell.
1,8-Nov-20,1,"Fot those wondering why Yankee Candles seem weak these days, there is a reason...they sold out. I was a long time Yankee Candle buyer since the early 2000s through 2017. I used to buy them in the mall and stock up when they had the buy one get one free deals. My first hint something was wrong was when I bought holiday themed ones during 2016. They just didn't have the same ""throw"" even though I was buying some of the same scents. I thought it a fluke until 2017 holiday season and I knew something was not right. I bought a couple more last holiday season 2019 and they still sucked. I had some unopened ones from 2013 or so and fired one up in another room for comparison. Sure enough, the 2013 jar lit up the room in scent as we all were used to whereas these newer ones were just dead. Bear in mind that was a six year old candle! So, I did some research. You are far from alone if you noticed there isn't the strong ""throw"" of scent the original Yankee Candles had. Here's what one member of a candle website review forum said what's going on in his/her March 2020 post:""A friend of mine worked at Yankee candles production facility the last 5 years and tells me that a lot has changed. When he started there was hardly any mineral oil used, now its about 40% of each candle. He says its just filler, so they don‚Äôt have to use as much wax. They keep upping the % of mineral oil as its a cheap filler and lets them make more per candle. He also says they have changed to a much cheaper scent. They actually have to use more per candle as its so weak, but its way cheaper than the older scent. He says constant cost cutting measures like this are implemented all the time to up the profits per candle. It‚Äôs far from the old Yankee Candle.""^^And there you have it. The new management of Yankee Candle is chasing profits over quality. Like many others, I have found MUCH better value in generic grocery store candles. Such a shame, but that's the beauty of capitalism for you. Someone fails, another fills the void instead of a socialist government telling you that you only have one option that they decide for you."
1,17-Nov-13,1,"Hazard to your lungs! Wish they would use true essential oils instead of fragrant chemicals! Very toxic for your home and lungs! I bought this knowing how toxic it is, but this was a present and that's what they wanted! Never in my lungs!"
1,28-Apr-20,5,"Amazing This is hands-down the best Yankee candle and I own like 40. My review on the Yankee website what's that it smells kind of like giving your 3rd grade teacher a hug  during Christmas time LOL. I really wasn't a fan of the other Christmas scents like ""all is bright"" or holiday lights (good but not strong enough and kind of perfumy). but this is totally different, I wouldn't say it has a marshmallow scent but it is very soft cozy scent, combined with the most subtle pine on Earth I would not know it was pine unless I read the description, I think it has kind of like a milky vanillaish base. it's really hard to describe but it reminds me of my third grade teacher who was my favorite person on Earth. So comforting but not at all perfumey. Just straight comfort. Great for any day any time. I'll have to buy like 10 more during the sale. Please never discontinued.. has medium throw."
1,7-Jan-17,1,"Do you want to turn your house black? Yankee candles will do it for you! Probably your lungs too! Do you want your house black? Because this will turn your house black.I noticed dirt all over a large jug of water in the kitchen. I rinsed it off and the next day there was black all over the water jug again. What the heck?Later, I noticed the Yankee candle in the kitchen had gone out so I went to relight it. There was dark sooty crap all over the inside of the glass. Huh. That's strange. Then I noticed dark sooty crap all over my coffee mug. Then the cupboards. The counters. My shoes. WTF. Then I looked up. The ceiling and everything within a 10 foot radius has a black hue to it. Everyone in the house has also developed a cough. I'm pretty sure this is the culprit. Did something happen to Yankee Candle??? Were they bought out by a cheaper company?? Are they trying to maximize profits by using sub-par ingredients and filling our house with cancer causing chemicals?? I wouldn't be surprised to see a class-action lawsuit soon.***EDIT*** Jeez. Don't try and clean it off!! I'll need to get those Mr clean wipes or something. We moved our coats off the wall and found the lovely soot surprise behind them (and on them). Also, YES, I TRIMMED THE WICK.Also: Foxtrot Uniform Charlie Kilo Yankee Oscar Uniform, Yankee Candles!!!"
1,14-Jan-12,1,Yankee Candle Found out a few days before Christmas that this item was either lost or destroyed in shipment. Was very disappointed.
1,11-Jun-15,3,"Good candle, but not my favorite scent I like most all of the larger candles from Yankee Candle, but I don't really love this one. Even though the scent is somewhat reminiscent of apples and cinnamon, to me it smells a little too artificial. When I first lit it and later came back into the room I couldn't recognize the scent and couldn't connect it with the candle. Maybe it's the walnut and maple that throws it off, but either way, it's not my favorite. I like it, but not as much as the other Yankee Candle fragrances.As I wrote in another review, we've tried different brands of fragrance candles and none of them even come close to the Yankee Candles. They are long lasting and fragrant - the scent is even and continuous right down to the bottom of the candle. Other cheaper brands don't last ¬º the time or have ¬º the scent and actually turn out to be more expensive than a Yankee Candle in the long run."
1,13-Jan-19,3,"It feels kinda cheap I feel like these candles used to be a lot more potent and last much longer 10 years ago. This is a fantastic scent, but the candle will only fill a small room with a hint of the essence. There are air pockets in the wax which make it glisten and look posh, but that removes what I'm guessing is 10%+ of the volume that could be taken up by solid product. I'm sure it has something to do with the way it's designed to melt and disperse the scent in the large jar, but that's a problem for Engineering. At this point, it's more of a status symbol of how homey your living room is than a functioning scented candle"
1,28-Apr-18,3,"Where is the scent???? We don't smell anything I don't understand almost a 5-star review of this candle.The scent is barely here, not even filling a small bedroom.I purchased for a son, who was excited that his room is going to smell like cookies.We waited for hours for the room to be filled with a wonderful scent, but this never happened.I would rate the scent strength 2 out of 5, that is - barely noticeably by anyone in our family.And being a Yankee candle, which last forever, I feel like I will never ever get rid of this candle :)Will not purchase this candle again.P.S: From all the Yankee candles we purchased, the strongest so far were Salted Caramel and Chocolate Layer Cake."
1,19-Aug-14,5,"One of the best Yankee Candles! This is one of the best Yankee Candles!  We light these during the holidays and the piney fragrance is marvelous and really adds to the holiday atmosphere.

1,13-Jul-13,5,"Pine like scent One of my favorite scents I like to use during the holidays; A nice pine like and berry scent with a good throw to it. A great candle if you like to use other than a straight pine or fir scent.SuggestionsIssue: Jar candles that don't burn evenly.Purchase (available online) waxed candle wicks with the base 6-8"" in length and a 12"" long drill bit around 11/64Drill a hole offset of the main candle wick about 3/4-1"" clear to the bottom of jar. Detach base of purchased 6"" wick and insert into drilled hole and trim to same length as original wick; now you have a 2 wick candle which will burn more evenly.SuggestionWhen your jar candles wick has expired and there is that little bit of wax left. Place Jar on oven burner and melt wax over low-med heat. When melted remove old wick base with a fork and placeanother wick as mentioned above but do not detach from base. place in melted wax and you have a makings of a new candle and just melt wax from other used candles and pour into jar candle with the new wick. after about 6 + used candles you will have a new candle. I keep my fall and pine- Christmas candles separate."
1,1-Apr-18,1,"I was so disappointed that only 1 of the 6 candles purchased had ... I purchased 6 large candles at one of their Mall stores.  The candles were offered ‚Äúbuy one get one free‚Äù sale.  I was so disappointed that only 1 of the 6 candles purchased had any scent even though they were burning for hours.  The best scented candle was ‚ÄúChocolate Cake‚Äù.  What has happened to Yankee Candle????  Maybe too many companies have purchased it in the past few years and are trying to rest on the laurels of the once top scented candle while cutting corners for profit making.  The same thing happened to Elizabeth Arden‚Äôs ‚ÄúRed Door‚Äù perfume once the Arden company was purchased and does anyone recall the lovely fragrance, ‚ÄúWhite Shoulders‚Äù?  The scent is not recognizable any longer."
1,5-Dec-13,5,"Baked goods & fireplace! My 2nd favorite Holiday scent (1st being Christmas Wish) from Yankee Candle.  I have been buying this scent for years, typically it is my pre-Christmas (November-ish) scent as it not quite Christmas-y to me but definitely not your ordinary Autumn scent.  The first thing you smell is the cinnamon, it is very strong (which I like -- I feel spicy scents are excellent at removing odors from the air, sweet scents just hang around too much and get nauseating) but so nice.  Then you smell what is stated as balsam but to me it is a fireplace/burning wood fragrance.  It is one of the combination scents (which I love) of Yankee's that I really find comforting -- I like the scents that you can't really figure out what you are smelling but the effect is wonderful.  To me, this fragrance is all about Thanksgiving -- before I light up the Christmas Wish."
1,29-Dec-17,1,"R.I.P. - off Yankee Candle Buyer beware-if you are able to get a candle that actually emits a scent (has a ""throw"") while burning, then lucky you.  But the quality of YC has gone steadily downhill for the last few years so don't be surprised if its basically has no scent.  What made me ""retire"" from purchasing YC is that I received a number of candles on a large order that weren't even filled up to the top-they didn't even get filled to the top of the label!  That is VERY poor quality control and a major rip off considering the price.  There are now many copy cat candle manufacturers that have just as fragrant candles and are a lot more reasonably priced-and I'm more than willing to give them a try."
1,14-Dec-13,2,"Maybe just a bum jar, but no scent I was simply ""pining"" for real Christmas tree scent.  I bought this candle confident it would deliver, as most Yankee candles do, but this one was a dud.  It just doesn't put out any scent.  Today, I walked into my hair salon today and immediately smelled the most delicious Christmas tree fragrance.  I darted my head around looking for the cluprit, expecting to find a 13 foot fresh Frasier Fir near by when my eyes fell upon the source.  It was a Trapp White Fir candle.  The salon had stock there to sell and I snatched one up immediately.  Lit it when I got home, and as I sit here right now the heavenly scent is filling our home.  Never heard of Trapp candles until today."
1,13-Jul-13,4,"Smells like baked cookies I tend to avoid YC food candles; why? They are so realistic that they make my sweet tooth go into hyper drive and this on is no exception. Smells like fresh baked cookiesThis has a nice sweet fragrance that will appeal to most.SuggestionsIssue: Jar candles that don't burn evenly.Purchase (available online) waxed candle wicks with the base 6-8"" in length and a 12"" long drill bit around 11/64Drill a hole offset of the main candle wick about 3/4-1"" clear to the bottom of jar.

1,27-Dec-19,5,Smells so yummy!! Love love this Yankee candle. It is such a great value for the large size jar. The sent fills my whole house with a yummy cookie smell. I always receive compliments from guest. Defiantly will buy again.

I lit THREE large jars on the same table and sat 5 feet away, and even after burning for an hour I couldn't smell a thing. You had to stand directly over them to even get a whiff of scent. Returned them in disgust. Will not buy again."
1,9-Nov-20,5,"Beautiful Scent!! This tossed me right into the Christmas Spirit.  The scent is fabulous with decent throw.  If you love the smell of all evergreen, this will not disappoint."
1,7-Mar-19,5,"Perfect Christmas candle I was nervous from previous reviewers that this would come in broken, but it was nice and secure all in one piece.I got this for $13 at the start of December and by time Christmas was over, we still had about half a candle left for next year. LOVE this smell."
1,6-Dec-11,4,"It's Hit or Mistletoe I'm not a big Christmas guy. If I find myself sitting on the knee of some fat bearded guy at the mall, telling him what I wish for most and whether I've been a naughty boy, then I've got a whole world of problems I really don't want to think about.Still, 'tis the season. So at my wife's insistence, I'm making an effort to find the ""Christmas spirit"" this year. Where by ""find"", of course I mean ""buy"".Mistletoe is an old Christmas standby, and romantic to boot. But who wants some hacked-off bit of poisonous plant looming over their doorway? Better, I thought, to bring the tradition home in candle form. I'm not usually so keen on the aromas of things that end in 'toe', but I have to say, this candle smells really nice and piney fresh.As mistletoe, it's another story. I tried angling for a smooch from my sweetie the other day, lifting the candle above our heads in the established mistletoe tradition. Sadly, the candle is rather heavy, and when I leaned in for a peck I accidentally dropped it on my own head. I thought I was getting a kiss, and instead I wound up on the floor bleeding from a head wound and trying to remember the name of the letter that comes after 'G'. And that doesn't spell ""Christmas"" in my book.More like ""junior prom"", from what I can recall. At least that came with a boutonniere and a flask full of Boone's Farm. Now all I've got is memory loss and this smelly green candle."
1,10-May-19,5,Smells Wonderfull Fresh pine scent smells absolutely wonderful especially on a cool night.  Makes me feel like I'm in a forest.  Love it!!!
1,20-Aug-18,5,"Great throw‚Äî smells like a Christmas tree. Smells like a Christmas tree and has good throw. It‚Äôs very overpowering, if you‚Äôre lighting two scents at once to mix. If I‚Äôm mixing at Christmas I like to mix Kitchen Spice, Silver Birch or Christmas Cookies in groups of two (any mix of them though)."
1,26-Mar-20,1,Lacks scent Buyer beware....lacks Bayberry scent.Shipping great---that's about it.Very disappointed.
1,4-Nov-11,5,"Pleasing Scent A little bit on the expensive side at $25. I managed to pick up the large Christmas Cookie for $4.87 at jCpenny with my $15 complimentary coupon they give me a few times a year for being a card holder. I will say this candle smells pretty darn good. You have to let the candle burn for a good hour when you first light it for the first time to enjoy it's aroma. When you relight it later the aroma kicks in pretty quick. This is a great candle to have burning around Christmas time, you have the family over rocking the turtle necks and the egg nog going you must have this candle burning in the background.."
1,23-Apr-17,5,"Christmas in a candle Comforting, warm scent. I have been searching for the longest time for a candle that reminds me of my childhood Christmases and this candle is it! My mother always had a candle that smelled just like this lit during the holidays and I missed that smell so much.  Now i will light this candle during the holidays just like my mother did."
1,31-Dec-17,5,"My NEW FAV SCENT!!! Got one of these candles for Christmas, and I absolutely LOVE IT. I practically have had it burning EVERYDAY since Christmass, and THERES TON still left.I can't believe how AMAZING it smells!!REALLY love this scent!!A++"
1,9-Dec-16,5,10 STARS!!!! If I could give this 10 stars I would.. This is now my second fav candle first one is white Christmas.. The scent of this candle just puts me in a good MOOD and love the pine smell.. I will never have to get a real tree again :) happy  customer!!!!!!!!!
1,18-Dec-17,5,"Smells like the holidays, and long-lasting! Smells great, and Yankee Candles seem to burn really slowly, so they are long-lasting.  I was hesitant in the past because they are expensive, but the quality is great, and they last longer than other comparably-sized candles."
1,23-Nov-10,5,"One of their best candles Balsam, aromatic cedar wood, and juniper berries blended together in a fresh forest scentIf I had to pick one YC scent as their icon and most popular signature scent this would be it. I light mine during the holidays. This is also available in their car jar line and a 2 wick tumbler jar.I disagree with the one reviewer who wrote that it has a weak scent; far from that it has a strong but not overpowering fragrance."
1,1-Jan-18,5,I really enjoy the way the candle smells i am on the opposing end of the other reviewer.  I really enjoy the way the candle smells. it is not overwhelming and provides a relaxing scent in my home office space.
1,9-Jan-20,5,"Always a great candle On sale, what more can I say it's a Yankee."
1,25-Feb-18,5,My new favorite The smell is strong enough that I can smell it throughout my apartment but not so overpowering that it's bothersome. Possibly my new favorite candle scent.
1,6-Sep-10,4,"Very nice for the holidays, especially in or near the kitchen It smells exactly as an old-fashioned Christmas cookie does baking- buttery, sweet & warm. I like it on a hall table that's right outside my kitchen- it greets me and my guests so nicely. It is a comfy scent. If the fragrance isn't strong, it may be that you got an older candle, because this is actually quite fragrant, even in a large space. It smells a lot like YC's Buttercream and Vanilla Cookie scents. All are interchangeable. The large burns for many, many days. I'd say 60-100 hours."
1,23-Nov-16,2,"Not A Fan Of This One Clean smelling. I get notes of PINE aroma along with a hint of CANDY CANES. Can't help but add that I can sense PLEDGE cleaner included.After half way burned, I threw this candle away. Not a fan of this one."
1,3-Jan-19,5,All year I use it year roundThe house always smells greatLots of compliments!!!!
1,12-Dec-17,5,smells good I bought this as a gift and got nothing but praise about the way it smelled.
1,5-Dec-09,5,"Smells Wonderful The smell of this candle is delicious.  It reminds me of baking Christmas cookies and has that just baked smell to it.  I have it in the tumbler, and it also seems to me that the Yankee Candles smell stronger than most candles I have bought in the past.  I would definitely recommend this product. The sugary cookie smell would still be good to have around the house after Christmas is gone."
1,26-Nov-16,5,"Smells amazing 100% authentic Yankee candle. Has the small imperfections like bubbles that every Yankee candle has and it smells just like real Christmas cookies. I'm giving it as a Christmas gift but I'm sure my mom will love it too. Great deal, as I got a LARGE jar candle for only $18!!! That's $9 off! Love Amazon and love Yankee candles"
1,26-Nov-16,2,Just a candle Candles are just candles.  Yankee candle has managed to take a $7 candle and make it a $22 candle with marketing.  I mean lets get serious here.  It is a piece of wax and a string.
1,22-Nov-14,4,"Not one of my most favorite candles, but I still love it Not one of my most favorite candles, but I still love it.  It's a great winter candle with the warm, spicy smell of apples and cinnamon.  I know it has some kind of nutty smell to it as well but I mostly enjoy the apply and cinnamon of it.  It's very welcoming."
1,1-Sep-17,5,"Smells Like a Real Christmas Tree! This is the best smelling Christmas candle I have ever smelled. If you want the house to smell like a REAL Christmas tree this is what you want!I just found out that Yankee Candle has discontinued it!!! I am distraught!!! But that is my life, if I like something it will be discontinued. :("
1,29-Apr-16,4,"Fresh pine scent Great pine scent. Only problem is that when I opened the package, there was green wax all over the inside of the box and on the outside of the candle jar. However, after cleaning it up, I love the product."
1,31-Dec-14,5,"Love This! I end up receiving this scent nearly every Christmas as a gift and am so happy with it that I even burn it throughout the entire year. It smells exactly like warm, frosted sugar cookies and has a wonderful scent payoff while it's being burnt."
1,1-Jul-16,1,"The quality of Yankee candles has gone down, little ... The quality of Yankee candles has gone down, little to no scent not worth the  money. Will buy other candles from now on."
1,7-May-17,2,No throw This candle has a good smell but next to no throw. So disappointed since YC usually has a solid throw to it.
1,4-Jan-18,5,Five Stars Great candle. Price was five dollars cheaper then at a local retailer.
1,20-Dec-18,1,Stinks Smells like cat pee.
1,7-Dec-11,5,great pillar! I'm burning two Christmas Cookie Perfect Pillars in my livingroom.  They burn wonderfully!  Its about time a company invented great smelling pillars in glass containers!  No worries about spillage on my coffee table.  Will get new pairs for each season.  Thank you Yankee Candle!
1,29-Nov-15,3,"According to Phil Lester Smell like a burning lantern that's been covered in snow. Oo! That's mysterious! I'd expect to sniff that if I went into like the home of a psychic and she'd just released a snow beast into the house. It's good! It's a bit perfumy, it smells a bit flowery. I don't like ones that smell of flowers. Musky. It's like winter musk. Might burn that one soon. Get to the musky vibe. -Phil Lester (YouNow Nov 28, 2015 21:40)"
1,6-Dec-12,5,"Great Scent! This scent has a great balance to it. It's not too strong yet you can definitely smell it. I love it's warm, vanilla sugary smell year round. If I'm in the mood to smell something vanilla I just pull out one of these candles. I've been purchasing them for many years and will continue to as long as the scent is offered. I'd definitely recommend this scent!"
1,29-Nov-15,4,"According to Phil Lester You can smell like children wearing coats... that's the scent you need in your life.... Oo! that's good! It smells like you've just fallen out of a tree and loads pine needle have fallen into your mouth. Yeah. I feel warm and cozy. Good one. I'd recommend that. It's nice. It's nice! -Phil Lester (YouNow Nov. 28, 2015 20:50)"
1,9-Nov-14,5,"Unbelievable scent! I went by the other reviews on here, and tried this scent. They were not kidding! I am not a fruity candle person, but this candle scent is amazing! Ok, I am hooked!"
1,5-Dec-11,5,Favorite scent This yankee candle is by far the best scent!  I use it year round and it instantly fills my house with a comforting smell.  This has been a family favorite for years.
1,22-Dec-17,5,Candles Bought for daughter who loves Yankee candles.
1,13-Nov-13,5,Best Smell on Earth! Has been and always will be my favorite fragrance during the Christmas season. You will never be dissatisfied with a Yankee candle!
1,27-Aug-20,5,Very refreshing scent Very good scent. Will definitely order again.
1,22-Nov-13,5,"Love This Scent I agree with the first reviewer.  I normally don't like any ""fruity"" candles but I absolutely love Cherries on the Snow.It makes me feel so good.  Can't explain it."
1,29-Nov-15,5,"According to Phil Lester THIS is the shiz. Haaah. I mean if you're hungry I wouldn't burn this because it's gonna make you want to eat the candle and I do not recommend eating wax. But that's just great. That's just like you are in a sea, you are in a sea of cookies and you want to eat yourself. -Phil Lester (YouNow Nov. 28,2015 22:35)"
1,5-Jan-12,5,"smells like Christmas My mother has burned this particular scent for many, many years. I'm nearly 30 now, and THIS is what Christmas smells like to me. If they ever do away with it, I don't know what I'll do. I LOVE it!!!!"
1,21-Nov-10,2,"Great fragrance but to faint I love the Yankee candles with a strong pine like scent, but this one is too faint. I was told by a YC employee that this scent most resembles that of a Christmas tree.I really wanted to like this fragrance but it was to weak for me;"
1,14-Dec-09,5,"Just like a real tree! Of the Yankee brand candles I smelled at the store (Christmas wreath, Balsam & Cedar, and Mountain Pine)this one smells the most like a real fresh-cut tree to me, I love it!"
1,6-Nov-09,4,Sweet smell of Christmas This has always been my mom's favorite Christmas candle and when I smell it I think of her.  Yankee always makes a great candle that will spread a nice smell through out your home and this scent is no exception.  It makes the whole house smell like someone is baking cookies for Santa :)

1,1-Nov-08,5,Perfect for the holidays I love this candle. I buy one every other year. We went to a fake tree a couple years back and when I have this candle lit it makes it smell like I have a real tree in the house for Christmas.
1,2-Jan-14,3,Jan - THIS CANDLE IS ONLY 13.99 ON YANKEE CANDLE. COM. ! This candle and many other large 22 ounce Yankee candles are 13.99 at the Yankee candle website (5.00 shipping for the entire order). Just a heads up for anyone buying candles! :)
1,27-Nov-16,5,Interesting how there mostly great reviews here for Yankee and then you see these ... Interesting how there mostly great reviews here for Yankee and then you see these bogus negate reviews most likely from people who sell another candle. This holiday candle scent smells great.
1,10-Dec-11,5,"Memories of Catholic Mass This candle reminds me so much of Midnight Mass when I was growing up Catholic. It transported me back in time when I was a child and the priests would light the incense on the altar. It smells wonderful, and will linger even long after the flame is extinguished."
1,22-Nov-14,2,"It's kind of minty and I can feel the icy cool mint as it reaches my nose I am not liking this.  My roommate has it lit right now and I have to say, It's really not sitting well with me.  It's kind of minty and I can feel the icy cool mint as it reaches my nose, and I don't like the feeling. or the smell. Not one of my favorites."

1,10-Dec-12,1,"Disapointing Really disappointed with this candle. It's overpriced, the smell is too faint and frankly it smells like cat pee :(Would not recommend this product"
1,11-Oct-13,2,"No bayberry? Really? Its a good smelling scent, but I actually talked to an employee at a Yankee Candle outlet and she went over the ingredients list with me. There is no bayberry of any kind in this candle. A little disappointing considering its called "" Holiday Bayberry""."
1,15-Jul-12,1,"I'm a teacher and I HATE candles. This item should be removed from the teacher want list, along with all artificially scented bath items. Burt's Bees is great, but I promptly throw away items like this and smelly bath items that send my allergies through the roof!"
1,5-Apr-20,5,Quality and price was right Price and quality
2,28-Sep-18,1,"Don't Order Candles When You're Drunk As the title states, I suggest that you do not order candles while you're intoxicated. I hate patchouli so I have no idea why I ordered this candle. I think I liked the name of it and at the time I was searching for a candle to put in my bedroom. I don't think I bothered to read the description of the candle or the reviews, which I normally do, and ordered it simply because of the name and because I like other Yankee Candles. Even though the patchouli is not the main scent, the fact that I noticed it at all was enough for me to dislike it. Also the candle had some hardened bubbles on the top and was not level, like it had melted and was slightly tilted on its side and then hardened in place. Neither of those reasons would have caused me to return this item - just a heads up to anyone who doesn't like either of those things. I am returning only because the smell of this candle does not match my personal scent preferences at all. Ew."
2,12-Dec-18,1,"Hair in my candle Y‚Äôall is NASTY. So I open up the candle and it smells amazing. Then I look and see that there‚Äôs a hair on top I though ok that‚Äôs gross maybe it‚Äôs my dogs hair and went ahead to light the candle and blow the hair away. After lighting the candle I realize to my horror that the hair is embedded in the wax, so I then decide whatever I‚Äôll cut the price of hair out with a knife and the hair is really up in this candle. I ended up being able to pull the rest of the very long piece of hair out of my candle. Was it gross? Yeah. Did I still use the candle? Oh yeah it smells good. But yeah it was gross and who is making these candles??  How on earth do you get you‚Äôre long hair embedded in a brand new yankee candle?"
2,14-Jan-19,5,"Perfect for baths Full disclosure: I am a Yankee candle devotee. My usual scent of choice is Kitchen Spice, but I ventured out for this one to replace a very expensive Volcano candle someone gifted me for luxurious baths. I was not about to drop $40 on a replacement jar candle, nosirree, so this Yankee candle, on sale of course, fit the bill. The scent is refreshing and sweet, but not too overwhelming, and it reminds me of strolling on the beaches of Hawaii, i.e. heaven. I also love the cute, millennial-pink color, and as always, Yankee candles have many hours of burn in them. I am delighted with this purchase."
2,6-Oct-18,3,Not the strongest smell... Yankee mistve changed its formula than the yankee candles I used to buy. No other candle could compare to yankee. One yankee candle would make your entire house smell amazing. This candle doesn‚Äôt do that. Its reach doesn‚Äôt go past one room but the smell is nice.
2,11-Jun-17,1,Very Disappointing Fresh Cut Roses is one of my favorite scents from Yankee. It used to have a good hot and cold throw.  The label pictured is deceiving in that is the old label prior to the company being sold. I chose this Candle hoping it was the original candle. Expect to get the new label product not the one pictured.  No scent of roses at all. Yankee needs to go back to the old labels and the old formulations to maintain their reputation.
2,19-Feb-18,5,"Beautiful Scent I bought this candle based off of the reviews from Yankee Candle. It was rated 5 stars. I‚Äôm glad I purchased this candle because not only is it beautiful, it gives off the most lovely scent. It‚Äôs a clean scent but it has warmth to it. This will def be our go-to spring scent in our home."
2,9-Mar-18,5,"NOT regrets in fact very happy! I absolutely love these candles. With the exception of being a little late I'm extremely happy! I was concerned about breakage after reading other reviews. However they came with plenty of packaging security for fragile items to prevent such thing! And as soon as I opened it you got a big wiff of lovely scent. And I've had it lit for a while and the scent has filled the room very nicely. I don't know why other customers had such a bad experience. They came perfect, smell wonderful and I love the pink, it makes the entire candle glow! I'm definitely gonna buy more!"
2,21-Mar-18,1,It does burn. That's about it. Smells like the sand. As in not much of a scent. I usually consider Yankee Candle products as candles with strong if unrefined smell. This is not one of them. 4 hours of burning produced nothing but a faint whiff of something that could have been a bathroom air freshener.
2,13-Dec-19,5,"Absolutely a top 5 fave for all year round winter blues buster best!! To the reviewer below: It's not Yankee Candles fault you ordered a scent u know u hate cuz your drunk & then have the audacity to give the product 1 lousy star, shameful.  With that said let me say I ordered 2 PINK SANDS scented lg . jar candles for office gifts and they were just as perfect a quality as tho bought in an actual Yankee store.  Stickers were straight, no bubbles, no hair as other reviewer tried to claim was case, filled level, wicks even.  If you are wondering about the scent,  I guess I can best describe it as a sweet mix of those strawberry hard candies, with a pinch of a cotton candy ish smell somehow combined with a light beach scent swirled with suntan lotion, sandalwood laden sand anotherwords ... ABSOLUTELY DELISCIOUS and not too summery that u cant can't burn mid January.  Infact, it helps me erase a little winter depression when I burn.One VERY IMPORTANT thing to remember with these candles for longevity is #1 TRIM WICKS down to 1/8 inch and monitor length. If you are seeing black soot on glass, wicks is TOO long. Also, all good candles recommend you light for 2 to 4 hrs at a time, let cool then trim & re - light. If you do this you will have perfect results.Ps. Never burn last inch or two as glass can crack ... *tip: Scrape out last 2 inches or so with butter knife (can put cool candle in freezer for 10 min. first for less mess) and put in a tart/wax warmer or save to use in one later. It smells amazing, gives u a few tarts worth and more bang for your buck, enjoy!!"
2,22-Jul-18,1,"Don‚Äôt waste your money. Doesn‚Äôt have a strong scent. Purchase in a store. This candle has pretty much zero scent when lit. It‚Äôs fragrant when not lit which really doesn‚Äôt make any sense. I‚Äôve had yankee candles in the past and they‚Äôll fill a room with the scent, it even will travel upstairs... this one was a waste of money. Only reason I won‚Äôt/can‚Äôt return it is because I‚Äôm currently living overseas and the cost to send it back would be about the same cost of the dang scentless candle."
2,28-Apr-18,1,"FAKE - DO NOT BUY This is definitely A FAKE. DO NOT BUY. The first clue is that the label was crooked, the second was that the top was not secure. The third is that it smells like literally nothing and now the wax is burning so strangely down the sides of the glass."
2,29-Sep-20,4,"Strong Scent, Long Lasting. Recommended. I have bought and used several of these candles in different fragrances, including: Lilac blossoms, Midnight Jasmine, Midsummer‚Äôs Night, Pink Sands, and Silver Birch.I have four dogs and one enormous great room, which includes the kitchen, dining area, entry way, living area, and the dogs‚Äô niche where their beds are. So I am always battling the smell to keep the house smelling nice.Overall, I would give this brand of candles 5 stars. Four out of the five fragrances I‚Äôve tried were pleasant smelling, had a strong odor that would fill the large room, and a long life. They were packaged very well (inside their own box) and burn evenly.Here are my ratings for the scents:Lilac: Five stars. Very strong smell. Sweet and flowery. I love lilac but it was a bit much for my taste for the main part of the house.Jasmine: Five Stars (more if I could!). Wonderful scent. Flowery but not over powering. Mellow. Lots of compliments on this one and asking where I got it, etc. Can be hard to find, too. Recommended.Midsummer‚Äôs Night. Five Stars. Pleasant, ‚Äúsoapy‚Äù smell. Reminds me of what the bathroom smells like after a shower. I loved this scent, but it is nicer for a bathroom than a main room IMO. Recommended.Pink Sands. Two Stars. Very ‚Äúpink‚Äù smelling. Reminded me of bubblegum. Scent was very weak. Could barely smell it at all. Wish I had returned it. Not recommended.Silver Birch. Five Stars. Very ‚Äúwoodsy.‚Äù Makes me think of fall/winter. Very pleasant smell for a main room. Recommended.I definitely recommend these candles overall, especially the four scenes above. The Pink Sands candle was such a dud I had to take off a star, but really these are good candles and worth the price."
2,22-Jan-16,5,"Beautiful scent and long life candle jar One of a trio of Yankee candle floral scents I like to burn in my master bedroom. The whole room smells like a garden, almost like the fresh flowers themselves. As an added bonus, the lighting is sublime and because our room is not enormous, the candles add actual warmth, very welcome on colder days, even in Georgia, which gets its fair share of cold days in Winter.The large jars burn a long time and I don't think I have found a brand that's worth what these Yankees are. The price you pay for them is worth it because they smell so wonderful and true to what they are labeled. I have not tried one nature scent yet that did not delight me."
2,4-May-20,5,"You Don't Want This Candle OH. MY. GOD!!!!! I highly recommend that you DO NOT BUY this candle! It is NOT the best damn candle scent you will ever smell in your life! It will NOT bowl you over with its room-filling, DELECTABLE fragrance! You will NOT find yourself inhaling deeply just to breathe more of its scrumptious, juicy, perfectly feminine, fruity-floral deliciousness!!! You won't be wishing that you had this fragrance in a perfume! You won't find yourself FLOATING around your home with your nose in the air, like a cartoon character hypnotically entranced by the wafting scent of sweet, tropical fruits resting on a bed of fresh flowers. And you CERTAINLY won't be RUNNING back here to order another one (or five) of these totally UNamazing candles because you WON'T want one in every room!I hope I've been totally clear. Because I absolutely DON'T have an agenda here, to ensure that there'll be more of these candles available for ME!!!:-D"
2,27-Oct-18,5,"Amazing smell, my new favourite! Love Yankee candles so bought this one based on reviews. Needed some scented candles for a house being sold (recently renovated and strong paint smells, not very homely) for prior to public inspections. Tried a variety of scented candles but this one was the best by far! Such a delicious scent I don‚Äôt want to ‚Äòwaste‚Äô it on open houses, I want it for myself! So I‚Äôm back to buy more. It‚Äôs a sweet scent, but also floral. It carried right through the top floor of the house (three bedrooms, 2 bathrooms and a hallway). It‚Äôs a delicate apricot scent with a stronger scent of a rich summer rose. I also bought a Gardenia Yankee Candle and that has a much more delicate and floral scent (still with that heady richness of gardenia, but subtler than this one). If you don‚Äôt like sweet scents this may not be ideal for you, but if you want a powerful candle with a great throw, this one will be a great choice. Came well packaged, arrived quickly and smells great straight out of the box. Burns well, although a little lack smoke from the flame. Worth it for the scent."
2,5-Aug-17,5,"Work in a nail salon and I hate it when people say that the place has a ... Work in a nail salon and I hate it when people say that the place has a strong chemical smells. After all it's hard to keep it all contained there are some thing that leak through. But with this a lot of my customers are always complimenting the smell and some even took a picture so they can buy it later. I've never bought this one before so I did it on a whim since everyone was raving about it. The candle was expensive but worth it, I've bought other candles and they go out within a week!! But this is long lasting especially if they're burned all day like I have them."
2,22-Jan-16,5,"Great value, great scent One of three floral scents (Rose and White Gardenia being two other favorites) I burn in my master bedroom, the combination is like being in a garden. In addition, because my bedroom is not enormous, the two each of the three scents, for a total of six large jar candles, gives off a genuine warmth, truly welcome on cold evenings. And of course the light from these candles, plus dim bedside lighting, gives a truly magical glow.I find the Yankee candles to be an unparalleled value for the length of burn time and the quality of the scent. There is no waxy smell, just pure romantic flowers. The floral scents, which I mostly favor, with the exception of the luscious black Midsummer Night's Dream, are true floral scents, almost as heady as the real blossoms themselves.When given the option, if you can afford it, always go for the large jars. By comparison, it is the best  value, giving a couple hundred plus hours of burn time. The only maintenance is trimming the wick after each burn and occasionally wiping off  the black soot from the top inch or so of the inside of the jar rim.Go for it ... the ambience is wonderful."
2,16-Dec-18,3,"*Notes Included* Definitely Not a Manly Candle. Too Sweet. *Notes include*Top Notes: Citrus, Melon, BerryMid Notes: OsmanthusBase Notes: Spicy Vanilla, Musk, Woody NotesNot the best Yankee Candle. It's like a big bowl of sugary goodness with a dose of melon. I've bought this as a car freshner and it was decent. The 22oz jar makes my house smell like a pre-teen girls sleepover while watching Hello Kitty on Tv."
2,16-May-20,1,"My 17 year old asked why I bought, an unscented Yankee candle? Not fragrant at all. Highly disappointed with this purchase. No scent when I took off the lid. ******** WEDDING DAY SCENTI asked my four kids what,  they thought about the smell. My 8 year old son said "" Its invisible"" my 17 year old said why did I buy a big unscented candle?? Especially a Yankee candle..*********I NEED TO ADD THAT IM REVIEWING THE BEACH WALK THAT I ALSO BOUGHT.. BUT WHEN I CLICKED THAT CANDLE TO REVIEW I WAS BROUGHT TO MY OTHER REVIEW.  NEVER AGAIN AM I WAISTING MONEY ON YANKEE CANDLES.  THE BEACH WALK WAS GIFTED TO MY MOM, WHO I ASKED IF SHE LITE HER CANDLE YET, AND SHE SAID THUS MORNING AND SHE SAID SHE CAN BARELY SMELL IT. MY PARENTS LIVE IN A SMALL apartment.  PLEASE THINK TWICE BEFORE YOU SPEND 16$ TO OVER 30$ OF YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY.  ON CANDLES THAT ONCE WERE HEAVENLY FOR THERE AROMAS."
2,6-Feb-18,1,"Worst Yankee candle ever What can I say. There are candles with strong scent, good scent, bad scent and weak scent... but this one has NO SCENT AT ALL, and I mean it.I already had candles with very weak scent but always read reviews, where people wrote about no scent... now I know. This one has no scent whatsoever, not even if you hold your nose in it. As I bought it from Europe, sending it back is just to much effort, so I'm burning it down, to get the jar. Stay away from this one. Yankee should give refund for these candles."
2,15-Mar-17,2,"Practically no scent throw This candle has almost no scent. I could smell the familiar scent (I've purchased several candles in the scent over time, but not recently) when about 2"" from the flame, but that was it. As I've written in other reviews, Yankee Candles have lost their scent over the last few years. I've tried to give them up but am doing so kickn' and scream'n. Have tried other brands. Can smell them, thankfully, but they don't have the nice burn of a good ole Yankee Candle. Don't know why YC is reducing the fragrance like this.Used to really enjoy ""Beach Walk,"" when it had a scent throw."
2,2-Jun-18,1,Only will buy directly from Yankee now as they give you credit for bad candles. I am the Amazon Queen lol all ... When I buy Yankee candles from Amazon they either don't have a scent or the wick is to short and goes out quickly as melted wax fills the jar.  I then have to dig out the melted wax for it to work again. Wastes a whole lot of the candle. Only will buy directly from Yankee now as they give you credit for bad candles. I am the Amazon Queen lol all else I get it wonderful
2,9-Feb-20,5,"The Best Candle I've Ever Purchased Before! These candles smell delicious! I will definitely be purchasing more of these. These candles also lasted a very long time as well. It was very cold outside and I had the fireplace going for two days straight since it was warmer in the living room and I decided to sleep in there. I also lighted the candle too and it burned for two days straight (not recommended). I did not blow it out once. The glass did not get too hot either. I always feel the candle glass when I burn a candle for a long length of time at once due to the fact that I have had them get too hot and break when the candle gets closer to the bottom of the wick. This candle stayed warm and did not get too hot. I was even able to light it for one more evening after I had it burning for 48 hours straight. When I lit it the 2nd time. I went ahead and let it burn down to the wick feeling the glass every now and then to make sure it wasn't getting too hot. It was fine and burned down to the wick like a good candle should do instead of burning less or half of the wax and then the wick is too short to light any longer. I promise that you will get your moneys worth with this candle. The flame is nice and bright and the smell is amazing. I ordered the Pink Sands, Sun-Drenched Apricot Rose, and the Honey Clementine. I have not burned the Honey-Clementine candle yet. It's a kitchen candle but I will burn it anywhere. All 3 candles that I had purchased were the larger 22 ounce candles. Thank you! I love these and will definitely buy more soon. These would also be awesome as a gift too. ?üëç"
2,14-Dec-18,4,"*Notes Included* Fresh Scent but Smells like a Hint of Vanilla Notes include:Top Notes: Mandarin LeafMid Notes: Jasmine, CedarwoodBase Notes: Patchouli, Sandalwood, Amber MuskI like most fresh scent candles from Yankee. I would've given this 5 stars but it's got a hint of vanilla. If you like fresh scents and a little vaniller, this is the candle for you!"
2,23-Apr-20,3,"Does'nt throw scent far in large rooms. This is an honest non paid for non free item given review.Fresh Cut Roses is hands down my most favourite yankee candle scent ever! I normally buy the large jars but since the COVID stuff is going on, I couldn't afford the large jar. Next time, I will wait and spring for the large jar because this small tumbler does not do the scent justice. Even though we only place it in an average sized bathroom.The large jar that is placed in my bathroom will throw the scent in the bathroom and spew out into our entire master bedroom sized room very well and very strong! But this small tumbler barely fills just our bathroom. I assumed it would still saturate the bathroom but it did not. It was very weak. Maybe this yankee candle scent only works well in a larger jar than smaller jar.It did arrive with the wick not centered. It was a pain in the ass. We had to push the un-melted wax side down after each burn to even it out. But it still burned uneven and made more of a mess than tranquility. We contacted yankee candle directly and they did respond fast and did reimburse us, which was nice and surprising since some companies just say oh well too bad. That was the best part of this small tumbler experience.If you like yankee candle or have a favourite yankee candle scent. Get the largest jar for the best scent throw. This small tumbler just doesn't measure up to the large jar."
2,26-Feb-18,5,"High-quality, well-packaged candle with a unique, crisp, semisweet smell Fantastic price, fantastic shipping, and a fantastic candle. I ordered 2 of these, and both were shipped in a secure, candle-shaped cardboard frame within the box so there were no issues with the glass breaking or cracking during transit. The Pink Sands candle itself has a unique smell that is hard to describe; there are hints of citrus and roses in the middle of a clean, crisp, semisweet airy cloud of awesome. I absolutely love it, and have yet to find another candle quite like it. If you're a fan of crisp scents (e.g., Clean Cotton) but also like soft sweet candles (e.g., Buttercream), you should definitely try this. Highly recommended!"
2,21-Jul-19,1,"Where's the sent? Got this candle at the ""special"" Prime Day ""sale"" price.  I wasn't aware Amazon & Yankee Candles moved out their old or defective merch during Prime Day.  That's the only explanation I can come up with because I have purchased Yankee Candles in the past and was always very happy even though I thought they were a bit pricey.The candle  I  got during the Prime Day Sale gives off less sent than the 3 for 10 bucks candles I got at Menards last Christmas.  No lie.This kinda wrecked shopping on Prime Day for me.  Certainly won't buy another Yankee Candle on Amazon, ever again.  Not really looking forward to the next Prime Day either."
2,22-Jul-20,1,Melted Candles Love the scent. But unable to use as you can see in pictures. This is my second order and they arrived worse than the first time. It melted all the way to the top and must‚Äôve dried. There‚Äôs no wick to light candle. And not to mention that when I open the box the liquid from candle got all over my hands and even stained my carpet. And I was carefully since the box itself had stains and was leaking. Horrible packaging.
2,19-May-20,4,"Lovely scent I bought the Gardenia scent  - both the newer and older versions of these candles: the older version I bought on Ebay.  This newer candle has a slightly stronger scent than the older candle I also bought.  It's a lovely, creamy light scent.  It might smell stronger if the candle were in a closed, airless room but the room I keep it in has an open window so the scent is not that strong which is a shame."
2,21-May-20,5,"Yankee candle nailed it, again! AMAZING! I got this for my mom as a mothers day gift. She went on to tell me that when she went to the yankee candle factory last year in MA (we live in PA, yes candles are that big of a deal lol) where she dropped 500$. She told me about all the different candles she got, many which I am familiar with. I've smelled alot of nice candles in my life, but this candle is so nice. The scent is light but not in a way that you can't smell it. Light as in not in your face or very strong smelling. It really does smell like fresh cut roses. I told her this candle would last way longer than real roses and she loved it. I like it so much im ordering one for myself."
2,13-Jun-20,2,"It is a 2 star and it is a 5 star... The Beach Walk Yankee candle has a heavenly , cool, clean scent of a summer at the lake.  I live one street behind Lake Michigan, and whenever I am outside on a breezy day , and can smell the beach.  It  is a relaxing and comfortable feeling.  That's how I would describe the interior of my home when the I go out, come  in , and inhale the scent of this candle.  I would rate it a solid five stars, except that my particular candle has a split wick, and every time I light it, it flickers and smokes continuously.  No matter how many times I cut the wick back, it  ultimately splits again and again, and smokes again and again.  I cannot  enjoy it for more than 10 minutes or so, before I have to snuff it out.  Mine was a glitch.  I will buy it again all summer long because this was a one time defect, and it wonderful.  Cheryl"
2,4-Feb-19,5,"Wonderful Scent First I want to start off by saying I love Yankee candles regardless, they always burn well and give off a nice strong scent. This particular scent is wonderful. I bought this with no option to smell it first and trusted my instincts knowing I've never been disappointed with any Yankee candle I've ever bought. What a pleasant suprise this one was!! I've received many compliments from friends and family who happen to be around while burning it. Also, I feel the decription given on what the blends are for each scent is very accurate.  Which for me helps decide if it's something I'd enjoy:-)"
2,6-May-20,2,Disappointed - no scent  : ( Actually SUPER disappointed with these candles. Yankee candles have always been my favorite. I‚Äôve always been able to count on them to keep my home smelling fresh and clean. The lavender vanilla is one of my favorite scents because it‚Äôs such a relaxing scent. I bought two because I burn through them so quickly and I NEITHER of these candles give off a scent at all... $40 wasted. : ( Not sure I‚Äôll ever buy a yankee candle from here again. At least I know I what I can expect from the store or website itself.
2,5-Jun-20,1,"""Fresh Cut Roses""? *What* fresh-cut roses?! I swear, I am never paying more than $5 for a jar candle again. A $1.49 unscented Virgin of Guadalupe candle from the supermarket will work just as well as this *thirty-dollar* candle in the bathroom. And it will smell just as much like roses! Well, okay, once I caught a slight whiff of roses when the Yankee Candle was lit today, but the price per whiff is outrageous. I can soak off the labels of candles from the supermarket and save a bundle.  (Shorties votives actually *do* smell like roses, but I'm having a hard time justifying the expense of their jar candles.)"
2,17-Aug-20,1,"Don't like the carriers lies! Not only do they not  hand it to me, they don't even ring the door bell so I know to  look for it.  They put it on the ground which makes it hard for me to pick up.  Then they lie on the  report and say they handed to me.  I don't like that.  This time, they put it in a wagon that I can't even see from my front door without going outside.  That is a far cry from  ""handed to the customer!""  I am handicapped and  just going out the front  door is difficult."
2,17-Aug-17,1,"BEWARE, not worth it! I am past the window to return but need to warn others this does not appear to be a real YANKEE Candle. The label looks like it but after the first three hours of it burning, there is not even a scent. The 'wax' appears to have some liquid in it, and the candle sits with all sorts of little bubbles on the top layer when not in use.  We have purchased YANKEE candles from the storefronts for years and we always like that they have a scent, unlike the inexpensive candles you can find other places.  This one does not burn like any YANKEE candle we have ever had and even the wick looks different, it is a lump of black, not the normal looking wick seen in all the other candles. Feel as though I have been duped. Disappointing!!"
2,11-Apr-20,1,Where‚Äôs the scent?? All yankee candles have lost what made them number one decades ago... their scent. I can burn them in a small room and barely smell what ever scent their supposed to be. Finally got a wif of this one bending down to blow it out. Its such a shame how consumers are duped and used by companies who get famous then reduce their product quality. You can see how much less the scent oils are used in these candles through the glass.Don‚Äôt know why I spend money on Yankee candles anymore?!
2,15-Sep-20,5,"nice candle I purchased this candle.  The first time it showed up broken and melted and it has been really hot.  The company promptly sent me another candle.  Upon receiving the 2nd candle it was also broken and melted due to the heat!  So the company had me return the second candle and I did.  Then I got most of my money back.  Not the companies fault, I would buy from them again just not in the HEAT of the summer for a candle that melts.  The packaging was also good on the product."
2,14-Aug-20,1,"Disappointed I bought this candle for my Mother‚Äôs Memorial. I light a candle every year to honor the family members no longer here and to celebrate their birthday. My mother loved lilacs, growing up in NH they‚Äôre are plentiful and so fragrant, our yard was full of lilac bushes and our long driveway was lined with these flowers. I ordered Yankee candle, always a favorite of mine, chose the lilac fragrance. Her birthday is tomorrow and I got the candle, it was fit into the cardboard mold unfortunately the top of the candle where the lid sits is broken, not just a clean break but several pieces. The timing is all wrong, but I will use it and hope it lasts the day"
2,30-Sep-18,5,One of my favorites I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs up with the people who say this has no scent.  I‚Äôve bought several and each has filled the room with a lovely floral scent that‚Äôs pleasant without being at all cloying.  I love it.
2,21-Aug-20,5,"This style is the better choice ! I bought several candles and made the mistake of buying some with just a ""lid "" as opposed to this kind, which is a secure ""tumbler style"" lid, that seals in the scent both before and after you burn the candle.The ones with the ""lid"" that just ""sit on top "" of the candle ""  caused the candles to arrive with absolutelyNO SCENT AT ALL.  So please be careful, and order this style .  I wasted a lot of $ on my Yankee Candles."
2,14-Oct-20,3,"IT MELTED IN TRANSIT! I received this candle mid-September during a super-heat spell in California.  I didn't need it immediately so I set it on a shelf (upright)  Today when I opened it, I found it had melted, apparently in transit since it had melted sideways in the jar with no wick visible.  Being a diy-er, I melted it in the microwave, retrieved the wick from the bottom, restored it and am waiting for it to re-solidify.The problem is that a good deal of the scent seems to have dissipated.  My kitchen smells wonderful, but my bathroom may not.  I wish they had considered the weather (Some vendors declined to ship to me during the heat wave.) before they shipped the product."
2,11-Jan-20,5,"Best candles out there There is just no candle company anywhere that makes as good a candle as Yankee. Their scents are amazing, the containers are great sizes, and these candles burn FOREVER! They seem pricey, but truthfully, they aren‚Äôt‚Äîbecause they last so much longer than other candies. Watch for third party sales‚Äî you can get ‚Äúused‚Äù candles‚Äîwhich are essentially just candles white boxes have been opened and then box and candle was returned for some reason‚ÄîNOT burned. Those are available sometimes from Amazon and they are a few dollars cheaper. Great gifts, too. My family knows when in doubt, give Mom a Yankee candle."
2,24-Feb-20,5,"Great Scent - Just not what they used to be Love Yankee candles. Fresh cut roses is one of my fav scents and is quite strong compared to others IMO.  It still has more potent scent than most do by comparison since Yankee has cut back so severely but is still no as strong as it was when it first came out. However, this last order was very pleasant, I must say. They both burned slow and I could almost smell them from my living room into  the hallway but not quite and that was after burning the first one for over four hours!  That's a long time to burn in a small apartment and NOT smell it, actually considering there is no door between the living room and the hall... so no, it's not as strong as it should be but stronger than MOST Yankee candles. Pretty much all Yankee candles just don't cut it these days but I do love this scent and as long as I was sitting in the living room on the sofa I LOVEd this scent and really enjoyed it.  As long and I get them on sale, I'm ok with them. I just don't expect much and I don't get too disappointed.  :-O"
2,1-Apr-20,5,"Best Scent This candle has the best scent. It reminds me a lot of White Shoulders perfume by Elizabeth Arden, which is my favorite perfume. It completely fills a room with its soft sweet floral aroma. It burns for a long time, and easily competes with other more expensive candles on the market. I'm glad I bought this and will definitely repurchase."
2,21-Jul-19,1,"Two Damaged Candles - Get it Together Amazon I love the smell of the Yankee Candle Pink Sands, which I bought during Amazon Prime Days for a great price. BUT, the 1st candle came melted and with no wick.  I sent it back.  The 2nd candle came with the glass broken. I sent that one back. I ordered a 3rd one. Let's hope the 3rd time is the charm!!"
2,7-Sep-20,1,"Melted Candle, what a mess, waste of money I received the two candles yesterday.  The Village Candle was perfect, packaged well in a larger box with plastic bubbles.  The Yankee Candle was sent in a small box just large enough to hold it tightly,  The candle was melted, and had poured into the cap, leaked out into the box.....what a mess, and a waste of $25.  I will try to melt it and retrieve the wick, because I don't have a printer for the postage return, and I'm not going out to mail it during this COVID thing.  Very unhappy with this product/purchase."
2,7-Jan-19,4,"Very relaxing, but not quite lavender I really enjoyed using this candle. I burned it for a couple of hours every night until it burned out. It didn't quite smell like lavender as I know it, however. It had more of a pine smell to me. It was still very nice, but not exactly what kind of smell I was looking for. I would still recommend it if you're not dead set on a 100% lavender-smelling candle and just looking for something relaxing."
2,26-Jun-17,5,"Another Great Find I love Yankee candles!  I've never been disappointed in any of my purchases from them, and White Gardenia is is no exception.  The fragrance is soft...not over powering but definitely present. I would definitely recommend this fragrance."
2,28-Feb-18,3,Not aweful... I like a really good scent that flows through the whole house....like bath and body works candles. These just aren't as strong and so I burn it longer and faster and it still just fills the room I am in.
2,23-Jul-20,2,"Deliver to be more careful with glass items If you look back I ordered several candles and all came in perfect condition.however this one was broken and can hear the glass in the box.  It was packaged good, no dents on the box so I can only thing that it was dropped by someone prior to me receiving.  I kept this candle since the glass that was broken was at the top and candle could still be used.On a positive note...the candle smell wonderful and scent does carry a long way.Thank you,Tamara Galindo"
2,23-Jun-17,4,"I am almost, happy with this candle I am almost, happy with this candle.  For some reason, the scents are not so strong anymore. I don't know if I will be spending $25 on a Yankee candle again. I bought two and out of the two, the white gardenia smelled a little stronger.  The vanilla cupcakes, no scent whatsoever .  Not sure, maybe I will give it another shot."
2,24-May-18,5,Great Summertime Fragrance What can I say...... it‚Äôs that time of year...... I love the smell of lilacs...... it‚Äôs a yankee candle..... and it don‚Äôt get any better than that?üëç?üèº
2,6-Nov-20,5,"Long Burn Life I was skeptical after reading some of the reviews about the Yankee Candles not being authentic on Amazon, but figured I would try it since it was on sale. I liked this particular scent (Pink Sands). It did take a long time to burn, which is something I appreciate since candles are so expensive. If you like the scent and prefer something more mild in terms of potency, I would recommend."
2,11-Feb-19,5,"Smells amazing! Honestly I ordered this particular candle because the price was good and I love candles so why not?  I‚Äôm so happy I took a chance in this scent!  It‚Äôs beautiful.  It has a strong rose base with other floral notes.  The throw is terrific.  In an average sized room the scent is quite strong and just permeates the whole area.  If you are looking for something subtle, then this will not be the candle for you."
2,18-Apr-20,5,Candle is great and smells so good! I am so glad I found the candles on here this is one of my favorite scents from Yankee candle.  I ended up ordering 2 just because they were prices so well and they smell so good in my house.  So far after using them a couple of times they look as though they have never been used.
2,11-Feb-20,5,"Lovely! I was surprised when I received this candle that it not only had a dominant note of beautiful rose , but it was layered and accentuated by almost a crisp pear note, and a few more that I can‚Äôt quite name but enhance the rose smell so much. It is much fresher and nuanced than expected, certainly not your grandmother‚Äôs cloying rose scent :-) can‚Äôt say much for longevity since I just got it today, but if you‚Äôre a fan of rose, perfume-type scents, and fresh/fruity/floral, you‚Äôll love this little candle."
2,24-Aug-18,1,Not good My friend had this white gardenia scent in Yankee candle so I bought this item. Terrible. Nothing like my friend's candle. Smells like bug spray. Waste of money.
2,26-Jun-19,1,"Two broken Sun Drenched Apricot candle jars I ordered a Yankee candle last winter. It was the best scent and longest lasting candle Ive ever had. I was so excited to get my next one but it came, altho well packaged, totally broken. I sent it back and got a replacement. Also totally broken. Broken glass pieces fell everywhere when I opened the package. A piece of glass actually cut me. Not just big pieces, but tiny ones too. It was a mess to clean up.  They both smelled delicious even through the packaging. What a bummer."
2,24-Apr-20,1,Not worth the money This scent is horrible wait a minute what scent? I purchased another scent by Yankee last week that really had my room smelling nice so I took a chance with the honey lavender thinking I would be satisfied well I was wrong. You can‚Äôt smell it when it‚Äôs lit. It‚Äôs been burning for 30 minutes now. I will never purchase again. I‚Äôm very disappointed.
2,22-Oct-20,5,"Every mom‚Äôs guilty pleasure! I love this candle. I Always enjoy the different scents especially when I match it with the seasons. It also lasts very long at least to my standards. It‚Äôs very giftable; sent one to my aunt, cousin and grandma. I always end up receiving positive remarks. I The only thing I don‚Äôt like about it is the price. So I buy many when it goes on sale."
2,16-Nov-20,3,"VERY strong floral scent I usually just attempt to find the best deal on YC large jars that I can as I mostly enjoy the warm glow of a candle and am not all that particular about scent. HOWEVER, this one smells VERY floral. Not bad if you enjoy that scent but I don't care for it. It's strong. Of course after a few lights it will fade so not overly bothered but doubt I'll be buying this one again."
2,16-Sep-18,4,Overall amazing candle. One complain on how they shipped my 4 candles. Two came sperate small yankee candle boxes inside the the shipment box and two did not. By doing this when I opened my box one of the candles was completely shattered so to how they shipped them. Other then this problem I love yankee candles and you can get them for half the price on amazon. My favorite scent is the pink sands. Last long and makes our home smell great!!
2,23-Feb-20,5,"So glad Amazon carries Yankee Candles I always buy Yankee Candles so when I saw the great price offered I had to try this scent. I usually wouldn't buy without first smelling the candle, but I've never gone wrong with this brand.  I love the scent, it turned out to be a light floral with a hint of citrus and it fills my entire house. Yankee candles burn slow and last a long time. I will definitely be a repeat customer."
2,18-Aug-20,2,Waste of money I thought if I got an expensive Yankee candle I would have my room smelling better it did not I took it to the kitchen thinking if I light it in there it would smell different it did not I took it to a small bathroom and you sit in there to see if I can get some kind of smell out of it I did not I will not purchase This again and waste my money
2,5-Nov-20,1,"Nice scent but something went wrong I love candles, especially jasmine scented ones, so I was really excited to receive this one and I had heard good things about Yankee Candles. However, I'm not sure what happened as it arrived looking like this. My best guess is it melted in transit and hardened all messed up. I'm currently melting it down on the stove in hopes of fixing it. I had also bought a different candle from Chesapeake Bay Candles that arrived perfectly fine. I will have to try out Chesapeake's jasmine candles in the future."
2,29-Aug-20,1,"Fresh Cut Roses:  Very little scent. Yankee should be ashamed. I don't know why so many reviewrs said that the scent was great because both tumblers, rose and lavendar/vanilla did not have a scent before lighting and no scent after lighting. I uesd to buy ONLY Yankee Candles because I thought I was guaranteed a beautifully strong scent but not in the tumbler size for some unknown reason"
2,16-Mar-18,3,"Smells amazing, but the throw isn‚Äôt very good. As I‚Äôve found with another Yankee candle that I ordered, the initial smell is absolutely amazing. This one is sweet and very clean smelling, but not overly sweet. Unfortunately they don‚Äôt burn very evenly, and the throw isn‚Äôt very good with this particular candle. If I want it to burn evenly, I‚Äôve got to burn it the entire day, and even then I really can‚Äôt smell it."
2,16-Oct-19,1,No scent candle This review is based on scent. The candle smells great when it‚Äôs not lit. Once you light the candle it has no scent to it. I allowed my candle to burn for 1 hour to see if I would be able to smell something and nothing.
2,14-Jul-20,3,"No padding in shipping means broken glass This candle arrives today with whole top broken due to it being shipped in a flimsy recycled cardboard clamshell with no padding. Candle is fine, so I decided that it was easier to burn it down to below the sharp broken edges that it was to return it during Covid. So here we are.Good candle, strong scent. But glass needs padding, which I‚Äôm sure a candle manufacturer knows well,"
2,20-Jul-20,5,"Ahhh, original strength so far! This has the reminiscent smell of previously bought Yankee candles. It filled the entire first floor of my home, 1200 ft.¬? with scent. And it smells heavenly. No skimp this time on Scent. It took 20 hours to burn half of it. So, it has lost some on longevity. Let's See how Long it takes to finish them up! Will return!"
2,9-Nov-20,4,"Good gift Candles a little expensive than I like to see but that‚Äôs just the brand, only issue I had was it came melted on the top. Had to submit for a second one, but Amazon was great it replacing it quickly the timing just missed the birthday party. My mother in law was still happy since it‚Äôs her favorite scent."
2,16-Sep-20,4,Strong Scent All of the wax was melted to one side of the jar. Had to re melt it to get to the wicks. Otherwise this is a very strong scented candle which we love.
2,30-May-20,5,Lovely lavender scent Love Yankee candles BUT this one came damaged. Fortunately I had an empty Yankee candle jar handy and a spare wick on hand so rather than return it I remelted the candle and poured it into the new jar. I didn‚Äôt want to waste what was otherwise a perfectly good candle.Word to the packers: please do better when packing glass items.
2,30-Sep-19,5,My First Yankee Candle I had no idea what a Yankee candle was and why everyone was freaking out about them. These really DO last forever. I like to burn candles throughout the day and evenings and it's barely made a dent in it. Great candle! Can't wait to try other scents.
2,19-May-20,1,Fragrance is hardly there I was disappointed with this candle. I went to Yankee Candle because they have a great fragrance. This isn‚Äôt true with this one. After blowing out the candle black smoke billows off the wick for a while. I bought a candle that has no smell. Should have bought a glade candle. So disappointed
2,4-Aug-19,2,"Down Hill Fast They are too big. Their product is typically inferior, i.e, wicks not centered, pooling, low burning flame, etc. Yankee used to produce quality candles, now they don't care, and for $21-$30, it's just not worth it. Yes, they have a huge variety of scents and other merchandise, I'm just not wasting my money on their over priced items. I don't even purchase when I get a coupon for buy 1 get 2 free."
2,7-Mar-18,4,"The perfect spring scent The perfect spring scent. I purchased one and within the next day, ordered another so I won't run out for a while. It was carefully packaged in a fitting candle holder so there was no damage. It's fragrant without being overpowering or too faint."
2,3-Nov-20,1,"Garbage Got the first one and looked like it was melted over, no wick anywhere to even get it lit.  Got it replaced for free with another one...Same problem!"
2,12-Nov-20,4,Love the smell I bought two of these because they‚Äôre always the best Christmas present in with holidays around the corner this is the best time to shop. I love the martini smell one but this one is as nice. I thought it would be the slim tall ones but these are Even bigger so that‚Äôs always a plus point
2,19-Jun-20,5,"Lovely strong scent (jasmine) I got the jasmine scent and I smelled l it immediately after I opened the box it was shipped in, so it‚Äôs quite strong! I wanted a strong candle so it‚Äôs perfect for me, but if you want a mild scent the jasmine one is not for you. It‚Äôs slow burning and the wick is great quality. I love it, and would buy it again for myself or as a gift."
2,11-Oct-20,1,Fake This candle must be a FAKE. Lid dI‚Äôd not fit. No scent other than wax. I think someone slapped a yankee label on a knockoff candle. I always buy Yankee or Colonial candles so I know how strong and lovely the smells should be. This candle is no better than a $5 one at best.
2,1-Feb-20,5,"Wonderful Scent! Beautiful Candle ! Smells amazing ! The candle on left I received as a gift and loved it so much, when I wanted to buy another I realized I couldn‚Äôt find a candle called ‚Äúlilac‚Äù just ‚Äúlilac blossoms‚Äú so I was concerned it may differ in scent somewhat. Nope! Smells wonderful just like the original one I had, great candle I love it  !?üíú"
2,28-Jan-18,1,... can‚Äôt even give this candle one star as it sucks. Once upon a time you could buy any ... I can‚Äôt even give this candle one star as it sucks. Once upon a time you could buy any Yankee Candle and bring it home to light and be blown away by the scent and scent throw. Yankee‚Äôs had your entire house smelling amazing. After Yankee candle was sold the new owners started cutting corners with the amount of scent they use in all their candles. I‚Äôve spoken to Yankee Candle employees about this fact many times and they all seem to have a different excuse as to why Yankee‚Äôs don‚Äôt smell like they used to. My favorite one is that Yankee decided to lower the scent levels on most of its candles as people where complaining the scent was to strong and bothering them. If you believe this and don‚Äôt mind spending $25.00 plus dollars on a large Yankee candle that has zero to little smell then by all means go buy one. Unfortunatly Yanke Candle know only has roughly ten percent or less of all their candles that will fill your house with a fair to decent scent. Nothing amazing as in the past. Having to spend hundreds and hundreds at Yankee to find those few candles that smell good is ridicules. I can no longer recomend this company and its frankly sad as they were once so great
2,18-Dec-14,5,"Love the fragrance this gardenia candle exudes Love the fragrance this gardenia candle exudes. I don't often buy Yankee Candle products, as they are often more costly than I prefer to pay for, but it is a challenge to find gardenia candles where I live, and gardenia is my mom's favorite fragrance, so she was thrilled to have a large jar candle with such a lovely gardenia scent. Isn't overwhelming, but strong enough to make any room smell better! This jar candle provided months of use, even after lighting every day! I'd say this is worth the cost."
2,29-Jun-18,1,Bad smell Don‚Äôt like the smell. If you want a good smelling Jasmine candle try Golden Jasmine from Bath&Body. Also came very melted and I had to use a torch to find the wick. That‚Äôs my fault for ordering in summer I guess.
2,21-Sep-20,3,"The scent is very nice but not strong at all I loveee these candles, the scent is very nice but when lit it does not smell like my other candles do. It does last a long time however."
2,12-Feb-20,3,Good I absolutely love ‚Äúpink sands‚Äù scent and how well yankee works. The only reason why I didn‚Äôt put 5 stars is because even if I order ‚Äúpink sands‚Äù they always send me a different scent.
2,22-Feb-13,5,Lovely & Intoxicating Jasmine is one of my favorite fragrances ever! It is absolutely heavenly. It is also a known aphrodisiac for those who are unaware. I love the size and value of this candle as well as the scent that emanates from it. Whenever I burn this particular candle house guests will always make a comment on how great my home smells. I repurchase Midnight Jasmine because it yields so many positive compliments. It's a clean and lovely floral! Try it and you'll see what I mean!
2,19-Nov-20,5,LOVE the smell!!! I absolutely love this candle! I use to have lilac trees at my previous home that were my absolute favorite because they smelt so lovely and this candle smells just like them. Having this candle smells so wonderful and makes me so nostalgic. The other positive thing I would like to mention is how wonderfully they are packaged! I have bought three yankee candles off Amazon now and each one is packaged with great care! I 100% recommend!!!
2,12-Jul-20,3,"Large Jar candle arrived shattered Opened shipping box and broken glass fell all over. Unable to use candle. Sending a replacement within ten days, so hopefully that one will arrive undamaged.  I have bought this scent before and enjoyed it very much, so was disappointed that this one arrived broken."
2,15-May-20,5,"Authentic My concern when purchasing stuff like this through Amazon is always authenticity. This was one of my fave Yankee Candle scents so I can confirm it is authentic. It's so lovely. Obviously scent is personal to everyone so that's all I can confirm :) Package arrived intact, safe and sound."
2,4-Nov-18,1,Do not buy - pink sands ordered Products shipped and no wick is visible. Looked like it was shipped like this.  Shipped in 40 degree Ohio weather- cap has no signs of melted wax either.
2,11-Aug-20,5,A Great Scented Candle At A Reasonable Price I find the Yankee Candle brand to be hit and miss. This is by far my favorite scent from the company. This candle is strong yet floral and not overpowering. The candles price on Amazon can't be beat. This candle is long lasting in burn time and scent.  Grab a match and light up this great candle.
2,30-Jul-20,5,"One of my spring/summer favorites! This scent is one of my favorites for spring & summer. I have the candle in my kitchen and the car jar ultimate in my car! It is a light enough scent that it doesn't give you a headache, but the scent reaches throughout the house when the candle is burning. I absolutely love it!"
2,16-Aug-20,5,LOVE!! This was the first time purchasing the Beach Walk scent.  I really love it!  It‚Äôs a nice clean fragrance and has a great throw. This candle definitely reminds me of the beach. The downside is that; my husband liked it too.  He stole it and brought it to his office!
2,22-Jun-20,4,Great company.  Great scent. I really love yankee candles.  They have stronger scents than most.  However. I purchased a candle for my mom for her birthday and wrapped it up when it was delivered.  She opened the gift and it was broken.  I‚Äôm glad to say Yankee candle quickly shipped another one free of charge.
2,2-Feb-19,5,"It fills up the whole room with amazing scent I had many candles in the past and non of them left as dominant, pleasant scent as Yankee Candle.I love that the scent fills up the room while they are burning and stay long after they are put out.In my opinion one of the best companies. The only matter is to pick your own scent. And do not follow people suggestions because everyone is unique. So far I have three favorite ones:1. Lilac Blossom2. Pink Sands3. Sage and Citrus"
2,20-Feb-17,5,"And they burn nicely. They look beautiful in our fireplace These smell wonderful---subtle, not overpowering. And they burn nicely. They look beautiful in our fireplace. I had read reviews before I purchased them. The low reviews were low because the product wasn't packaged properly and arrived broken.  It looks like the company has fixed this problem, as ours arrived properly packaged with no problem."
2,20-Oct-20,5,"Lasts forever. I thought this candle would last like a day, it's been 4 and it's only half way done. The scent is nice and chill, not over powering like the other one I purchased that, I can barely stand for more than 3 minutes. This is a great scented candle."
2,28-Sep-20,3,"it was alright.. This candle is extremely sturdy and looks really good on my desk. Although the color of it is really nice, the scent wasn't that good in my opinion. I am sure other people might like this scent, but it isn't my preference."
2,14-Jul-20,4,Love the scent but it arrived broken I ordered two different Yankee Candles of the same size. They arrived in two different sized boxes with packing that was supposed to prevent breakage. The whole top lip was broken into many pieces. Most of the breakage was above the wax line so I kept it since I had another container that I could sit it in to burn.
2,30-Apr-19,5,"Great! I took a chance and ordered this Lilac candle, and had never smelled it before.. it was a top rated candle on the Yankee site as well so I thought Id give it a try. So glad I did! I LOVE the smell and its the perfect spring/summer scent. So so glad I took the chance on it through Amazon, great price, and great smelling candle. Love it! Will definitely be ordering again."
2,8-Sep-17,5,"Smells great, carefully packaged. This candle smells exactly like it says it does. It smells just like lilacs, and it doesn‚Äôt smell artificial at all to me. The fragrance is strong enough to be noticeable and pleasant, without overwhelming (probably since it‚Äôs floral).I was nervous to buy this because other people seem to have received broken or melted candles. I didn‚Äôt have this issue. The candle was in multiple layers of sturdy and supportive packaging.I wouldn‚Äôt recommend leaving this product on your doorstep for too long on a warm day... I think that may be how people get melted ones. You can get a notification from amazon when it arrives so that doesn‚Äôt happen."
2,19-Sep-20,2,"Can barely smell it Like the title mentioned, I can barely smell it. I have to come close in order to get a faint odor."
2,27-Sep-20,4,"Good value for the brand Looked like there were some slight imperfections on the candle, but overall happy with scent."
2,13-Sep-20,3,It's like its old! It didn't have much of a fragrance when I opened the jar. You can't smell it when it's burning. I put it in a bathroom and closed the door and still not much scent at all. It's like the jar had the lid off it for a really long time and the fragrance is gone. I have purchased many items of this scent and this is the only one that is like this.
2,20-Sep-20,5,Highly recommended/fast shipping/ good packaging Very strong scent! The price is better on Amazon‚Äôs market than buying from the Yankee Candle.
2,16-Sep-20,1,Disappointed If l could have given this 0 stars that rating would have been warranted. This item was delivered twice each time the glass jar was broken. Scary when you hear glass rattling in the box.  The good thing was I'll be refunded but only after the defective product received back to Amazon. I did not get my full refund. Taxes paid for not equal taxes refunded.
2,5-Oct-17,4,"Did not last long at all It smelled SOOOO good, but the smell went away after about 8 hours of burning. It also didn't burn evenly, and left alot of wax and the wick ended up burning out before half the candle was done. Pretty disappointing for such an expensive candle, but that scent was unbeatable. Probably going to get a scentsy of this scent, if I can."
2,25-Dec-18,1,Not the right candle I got the wrong candle.. instead of bothering with a return I just gave it to someone for a Christmas present. Kind of disappointed I was really looking forward to the pink sands.
2,6-Nov-20,5,Rose scented This rose scent is by far the best one they have.  It would be hard to make this one better.
2,21-Sep-20,5,Great Candle - Smells Wonderful This is one of the best smelling candles i've used. Will order this again.
2,1-Sep-18,5,"Lovely scent, great price I love the quality that Yankee candles still produces for their candles, and love the scent - it is very soft, not flowery, just wonderful.  Price on Amazon is better than the sale prices I have seen.  Glad to be able to get it here."
2,3-Nov-18,1,"Disappointed. No scent. Must be detective or not original. So disappointed with this purchase. This is my favorite candle scent.  I've bought this candle several times from the store. Almost immediately you can smell the scent coming off the candle.  This time there is almost no scent what so ever.  I burned it for hours and still it is so faint,  if anything at all.  Must be defective or something. Something is definitely wrong. Waste of money."
2,17-Jul-19,5,"Love it I have ordered this candle twice now for friends who have gotten engaged as part of an ""engagement basket"". Can't weigh in on the scent or longevity, but let's be honest, you're not buying this candle for either of those things. Looks great. Love the aesthetic."
2,29-Dec-19,3,"The smell was NOT pleasing I love yankee candles but the smell of this lilac was not pleasing at all.  Yuck.  Hey, I normally enjoy the smell of lilac or I wouldn't have purchased it, but this one was a big no for me.  I suppose I could have gifted it but would have felt badly giving a candle that I thought smelled bad."
2,25-Apr-17,5,"Great candle. Very aromatic candle, truly rose fragrance."
2,11-Jul-20,1,NO SMELL No Smell. Yankee‚Äôs quality control has been atrocious in the past few years. 75% of the way through this candle and I have yet to smell it. Pink Sands and Lilac Blossom are the only 2 I‚Äôve bought that haven‚Äôt had at least 1 have no smell at all. Buy Woodwick instead. More expensive but at least you get a scent.
2,23-Oct-20,3,It smells like literal petals (not a compliment) It smells like literal rose petal and I don't mean the metaphorical one or the prefume-ish smells it gave me a headache. But if you want the inside to smell like dirt or outside this is for you. It's not the candles fault I didn't like it though. I just expected something different.
2,2-Jan-19,5,"Love my Yankee Lilac When these are on sale, I always pick up a few.  The Yankee Lilac is by far the most natural lilac scent I have enjoyed.  There was a soy candle that once came close, but the constancy of Yankee makes it my go to for classic lilac.  I can't stand the complicated sweet, or 'air', or layered beach night.  I want a simpler truer scent and that is what I get here."
2,21-Oct-20,5,"Scent not too strong Scent is not too strong for those sensitive to smells. However it does smell great and I wish the smell was stronger! It takes a while for an entire living room in an apartment to smell like the candle scent, so this may be perfect for those who dislikes strong scents"
2,16-Feb-20,5,"Great candle, smells just like roses! My husband got this for me as part of my valentine day gift. I have always loved rose scented items perfumes/candles. This scent smells just like fresh roses the smell is very potent but not overpowering my house smells amazing. Will definitely purchase again!"
2,21-Jun-20,2,"No scent this time I ordered once and liked the scent and longevity - so subscribed to it. Alas, this candle is not as fragrant as the last one. Is it possible that once you subscribe, Amazon starts sending Chinese counterfeit products or maybe this one is past expiration date... do candles have an expiration date??"
2,21-Oct-19,2,"Subpar yankee candle Super disappointed by this yankee candle. I guess that's why it was on sale? It doesnt smell AT ALL.Ok, maybe I'm exaggerating. It smells if you put your nose within a few inches of it. -___-"
2,22-Jul-15,5,"I surprised myself with this one -  I usually like spicy scents! I went back and forth about whether or not to purchase this, when it suddenly went on sale for 50% off. I said, ""What the heck. If I don't like it, I'll give it away.""I'm happy to say that it now sits in my bathroom, and remains lit whenever I'm puttering about the apartment. It has a lovely scent - true to its name, it smells like fresh cut roses - and it has a great throw."
2,19-Feb-19,1,"The disappointment! What a rip-off and BIG DISAPPOINTMENT! I burned this candle for 2 days! Once on my dresser but couldn't smell anything! I then moved it to my enclosed bathroom for several hours but still couldn't smell anything! I'd expect this from a lesser brand cheaper candle, but not Yankee! I was all excited because this was supposed to be a new scent! What a let down! ?üò§?üëé?üè?"
2,9-Apr-18,5,Five Stars Loved candle especially the scent; I will probably order this again.
2,14-Feb-20,5,Pink sands smells great For the second time i ordered from amazon and my item arrived damaged .. smells great but it‚Äôs completely useless.
2,22-Sep-20,3,"Good, but not one of our favorite scents Like other scent better, like lavender scentmuvh better."
2,2-Aug-20,1,"Broken Glass and shattered in shipping Right when i picked up the box I knew something was wrong. I heard noises inside which was unusual since this is a candle...there should not be clinking noises. The candle was inside the candle holder, in the yankee candle box, in an amazon box with two  ‚Äúairplus‚Äù bags. Not sure how it could have broken like this but it did. Pretty disappointed as it was supposed to be a gift for someone. Wish they could have done better. Be aware this is a possibility when ordering this through amazon. Something to think twice about."
2,31-Dec-19,5,Nice sent Came broken- but not your fault. Top of jar was smashed. Lovely smell.Good price. Postal is crazy at Christmas time. U marked fragile.
2,4-Jun-19,5,Yankee candles are the BEST! I love Yankee Candles! I think they have the best scents and that actually fill a room with the aroma not like other candles that smell good in the jar but once lit they have no scent. My favorite is Fresh Cut Roses which truly smells like roses! I love my candle but do wish it was more affordable.
2,11-Dec-18,4,"Great scent! This candle smells great. It's not a very strong scent, but it's still a nice subtle smell. I would definitely recommend it to anyone."
2,18-Sep-20,5,Get a great nights sleep! Well worth the money! I have insomnia! I light this candle about an hour before retiring. It helps me go to sleep. I find the fragrance to be Absolutely fantastic. I will buy this product over and over again.
2,14-Nov-18,1,"OVERPRICED.. FEEL LIKE I WAS ROBBED... Love this candle... My complaint I paid for what I thought was a larger candle boy was I fooled. The large size is the same and the medium size..  I am ticked off because I paid more for the exact size, candel is just in a different vase/candel holder. I will no longer purchase candels online from this comapany.. Walmart is cheaper as well as Target. Will be going a step further on my complainy due to false info provided. The candel is no bigger than the medium candel tbat I have been purchasing for months.. So disappointed... Zoom in and see the size. Smh"
2,28-Apr-20,1,"YUCK! I was hoping that with a name like Beach Walk, this candle would smell....well, beachy. Unfortunately, it doesn't smell like anything you would associate with a beach on a hot Summer day. Instead, it smells gross. Bleck!"
2,19-Jul-20,4,"Love the scent , broken gift Busted glass . So disappointed in deliveryI doubt it was broken when it left the warehouse. I thought I accidentally ordered something else because of the jinglingDo not put in bigger boxes !The other arrived just fine"
2,13-Aug-19,1,"Honey Lavender Gelato is Basically Unscented This doesn‚Äôt really have a scent other than the warm wax scent you could get from a basic, unscented white candle. The unlit candle had a very light scent that really was kind of a non-specific sweet smell. Serious waste of money."
2,10-May-18,3,"Smells great but smoky Originally, I rated 5 because it was a good price and size for a bedside end table. And the candle smelled great! I don‚Äôt usually care for the smell of lavender. But this candle is mixed with honey and gelato, and smells fantastic.Unfortunately, every time I light it, it would become crackly and smoky. None of my other candles do that. So I had to stop using it in case I fall asleep and something happens. I‚Äôm not sure if they can change an ingredient to prevent this? I really like the scent."
2,9-Jul-20,5,PERFECT Bought for a nurse who cared for me and she LOVED IT.  Gave me a hug.  She said it smelled wonderful and was her favorite color too.  I owe her more than a candle in so many ways.  Nurses are angels..
2,15-May-17,5,"Creates a garden scented wonderland! Love this candle! Reminds me of my garden back in FL where I had flowering jasmine groundcover. Nice, strong smell.  Mmmmmmm! Super long burn time!"
2,26-Jan-20,1,How come this candle smells like... Lilac Blossoms is not supposed to smell like human urine when lit. That is all I have to say.
2,2-Oct-20,5,"LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!! Omg!!! I absolutely love this candle! My apartment smells so good. My apartment has never smelled this cold before. I have two pets and no other candles have helped, this candle is a must have. I have never bought a yankee candle before. Will definitely be trying other scents. Thank you so much!!"
2,18-Apr-20,1,This candle has no scent This candle has no scent.  I bought the candle because Yankee Candles are normally very good. I wanted a lavender scented candle and all I got was a purple candle in Yankee Candle jar.I do not recommend buying this scent.
2,27-Oct-20,1,Unable to Use Candle Unable to use candle because it was damaged upon arrival.  Tried but candle would not light
2,16-Aug-20,5,love the scent I love the smell of lilacs .  I've bought this before and I'm very happy with it.  Is last a couple of weeks but then again I burn it for many hours especially on the weekend.
2,14-Aug-20,5,"Yankee candles I have used Yankee candles for many years I love the product. The candle usually burn all the way.  I really hate to see the prices continue to go up,  but still a good product."
2,21-Sep-20,5,Super gift Yankee always makes a great gift.
2,22-Sep-20,5,Smells great It was a gift and they loved it - well packaged
2,4-Jul-20,1,Was an old candle -wasn not even pink. Do not buy Yankee candles from amazon. There is no dicount. This candle has no color and no scent and a faded picture on the front of the candle. It was very old. Buy from Yankee you can get some good deals. The scent was sold out. It is my favorite. Now nothing but wasted money!
2,30-Aug-20,5,"Excellent candles! I have always loved these candles. They burn evenly and smell amazing!  I get 2 or 3 for each season and they fill my home with wonderful scents of Autumn, Christmas, Springtime and Summer."
2,9-Oct-20,1,Damaged during shipping Both candles the glass was broken haven‚Äôt heard a thing about my complaint
2,21-Feb-12,5,"If you like the scent of roses...! This candle has a lovely, true-rose scent and Yankee is one of the few that I've been able to find, lately, still offering some of the true-flower scents. A party candle company from which I used to buy has just about done away with all of their true-flower scents (I preferred theirs to any others, but since they no longer offer, it's a moot point!), so finding this available on good-ol'-Amazon, was nice for me...The scent is fairly strong (which I like) when the candle is burning and the candle color is a pretty, classic tea rose flower pink (not garish ""bubble gum pink"", thankfully wouldn't have bought!)...I like it all around, just fine."
2,24-Sep-20,5,Great candle Girlfriend loved said it was one of her favorite scents. The first one did come damaged but replacement was super simple and replacement came very quickly
2,15-Jul-20,5,Wonderful Company I received my candle and the jar was broken. I Let the company know and they took wonderful care of me. Fast and responsive customer service. I love the scent and the candle is beautiful!!
2,3-Dec-19,1,"Inconsistent I smelled this candle (enchanted moon) at Walmart and kept it on my wishlist until Black Friday when it was on sale. The candle I received barely even smelled, and did not smell ANYTHING like the exact same candle at Walmart. The one I received is perfume-y and gross."
2,24-Mar-20,5,"Gift What's not to like about Yankee Candle? The scent is strong and pleasant. This particular scent is exactly what my friend wanted, so it's what I got for her. Large size. Lasts long. Decent price."
2,16-Aug-19,5,"nice Lavender Vanilla scent not as overpowering as some Yankee Candles - nice scent in a long lasting candle, not too sweet like some vanilla candles can be"
2,1-Sep-18,5,"Love this scent, very glad to have found it here. Just love the softer scents that Yankee has, hating the fruity, foody, stronger scents.  This one is just fresh, and easy to have around all the time.  Love the price through Amazon, and don't see it as a choice in stores as often."
2,5-May-19,5,Good deal Lol no scent yeah right / I almost dint get this because of reviews of no order but price was good now it‚Äôs great because I love this scent / it‚Äôs like smelling a sweet lavender flower it‚Äôs not strong like you walk into a room of cupcakes ?ü§??ü§¢but I love it lol
2,21-Oct-20,5,"Amazing smell, nice big size and a great gift. Has a nice lilac blossom smell and a pretty purple color. Looks the same as in the photos. Plan on giving it as a gift and I'm pretty sure my mom will love it!!"
2,2-Aug-17,3,"Presentation is as important as the scent Product smells nice but arrived with half the wax on one side of the jar. I had to melt it down and rotate in order to be able to even use the candle, as the wick was buried. That part was extremely disappointing as I have purchased many yankee candles in the past and never experienced this. After a few days I was able to utilize the candle."
2,18-Nov-20,4,"Nice but weak scent This smells really nice but not very strong. I‚Äôm not sure what I was expecting. It this is still a great candle. After all it‚Äôs Yankee, it is known for that!"
2,6-Jul-19,5,"Top notch This is my second time buying this scent. I love yankee Candles in general, they are high quality. You definitely get what you pay for. Midnight Jasmine is a lovely scent, it does not smell exactly like night blooming jasmine, but very very nice, no complaints at all."
2,19-Sep-20,5,Love!! Love the scent!!
2,29-Sep-20,3,Will not buy this again. Very little fragrance.
2,9-Apr-19,5,Lilacs heaven Lilacs are my absolute favorite flower but unfortunately their bloom time is so short. I was leery of ordering a candle on line without smelling it but I am so happy I did!I bought 2 and they smell exactly like the flowers and puts off an amazing amount of scent.
2,29-Mar-15,4,"You can never go wrong with Yankee Candle! So, I had never smelled this scent, but it was highly rated so I went with it! This candle is gorgeous, don't get me wrong, I'm just not 100% a fan of the scent (hence the 4 stars instead of 5). It's a lot sweeter than I would have thought, which is okay, but I was hoping for more of a floral scent. But still, it has a great burn time, and it an absolutely lovely pink color."
2,24-Aug-20,5,best deal great scent
2,13-Nov-20,3,Broken glass 1 of the candles were broken - top cracked  I can forward a picture if you‚Äôd like
2,3-Apr-20,1,"My deodorant has more fragrance than this candle! ‚ÄúBeach Walk‚Äù fragrance? Ha! I surely did not smell sand, or an ocean fragrance. My deodorant has more of a fragrance than this candle. These are definitely not TRUE Yankee Candles. These are definitely knock offs. Fakes. Save your money. I‚Äôm clearly disappointed."
2,7-Aug-20,2,"Came broken The lid and the top of the glass container the candle is in came dangerously broken.  Be careful opening.  It's a Yankee candle, so it's what I expected in every other way."
2,18-Nov-20,5,"The best candles in the market place I have tried many brands over the years and I keep coming back to Yankee Candle.  Great quality, fantastic scents, and wonderful customer service."
2,11-Nov-20,1,"Faulty and money down the drain. The candle didn‚Äôt burn properly. It created a large black smoke that stained my wall and no matter what, it failed to go away. I had to throw the whole thing away. As expensive as these are. What a waste."
2,1-Jun-20,3,"Smell is not as strong as typical yankee candles I‚Äôve ordered this item before (not through amazon) and loved it, but the item I received doesn‚Äôt give off a particular scent unless you‚Äôre standing right by it. Unlike most yankee candles, which scents envelope the room. I might have gotten a dud or an old item. Won‚Äôt be ordering here again"
2,4-Nov-20,2,Doesn't smell This candle was a very big disappointment I normally buy seaside woods which makes my house smell delicious this candles did not emit any aroma
2,2-Dec-18,1,"Disappointing I keep hearing how great Yankee candles are. I've tried several and am always disappointed. Someone suggested I try this scent and I wouldn't be disappointed. Wrong. The candles do not burn evenly, and the wick is not strong, so a waste of wax. I'm sticking to Shorties candles. Best I've found so far."
2,19-May-20,1,No scent I LOVE yankee candles especially The Pink sands scent BUT unfortunately both of the candles I bought here gave off ZERO scent.Very disappointed
2,22-Nov-20,1,"Defective product, nearly injured. Received my order today and it shattered all over the place and got all over the room. As soon as I uncapped it, it went off like a bomb. Literally shot 15 feet across the room. I am lucky i didnt catch it in the eye. Not happy with their safety level. This could have ended very badly. There is fine glass dust all over my bed and clothes. It went over the whole room."
2,10-Nov-20,5,Smells great! This is the first yankee candle I have ever owned that I could smell all the way through my home.  It smells wonderfully divine.  I would recommend this purchase over and over again.
2,13-Apr-20,2,Disappointing. This was disappointing. I bought the same candle and a different retailer and fell in love with the smell. This one I ordered didn't provide any smell. Very disappointing.
2,28-Apr-18,1,"Seems counterfeit Seems like a counterfeit product. Weak smell, slightly different label on bottoms than one bought in store, and burns differently than ones bought from store. Lavender purple was bought on amazon and white one was bought in a store. I don‚Äôt recommend buying on Amazon."
2,23-Mar-17,3,"Candle is great, but the price I paid (~$16) is a ... Candle is great, but the price I paid  (~$16) is a little steep for a 7 oz candle. If you're not sure how big a 7 oz candle is, it's probably smaller than you expect. The popular home goods store sells these for $11.99. So, yeah."
2,10-Jun-16,5,"Love it.  Lasts a long time, fantastic scent I love anything Yankee Candle really.  this Lavender scent is fantastic and very relaxing.  So far it has lasted me a month and is only half burned.  Always worth the cost of a Yankee Candle."
2,18-Nov-20,5,Excellent choice! This candle fills the room with a beautiful rose scent that is not overwhelming. I have medical conditions that cause problems when I‚Äôm around heavily scented perfumes and candles but that was perfect.
2,17-Jul-19,3,"Cotton candy-like scent I love Yankee candles but this scent is a little too sweet for my taste‚Äîsimilar to the smell off cotton candy. I still burn it regularly as it smells better than my dog, but I‚Äôd take the clean linen Yankee candle over this scent any day!"
2,21-Mar-20,5,Calming scent Calming lavendar...even burning wick.
2,13-Dec-18,2,Candle melted Very disappointed about the condition of the candle when it arrived...I don‚Äôt want to believe it left yankee candle in this condition. It had all melted to one side and the wick was buried beneath wax. Had to dig it out to get it lit. As you can see had to shave a lot of was off to get it lit. Yankee candle should look into how their product is being shipped.
2,5-Nov-20,1,Melts!!! Will potentially melt and become reshaped before it gets to you. Had to melt it down to pull out wick and reset it........
2,22-Jul-20,5,BEST YANKEE CANDLE SCENT!! I have purchased a TON of candles in my life and it is my GO TO CANDLE. I don‚Äôt have one bad thing to say.AMAZING SMELL. GREAT PRICE. Long burning. Authentic.
2,17-Feb-20,5,New smell This candle it my new favorite smell one of the best candles from them
2,16-Jul-20,5,"Great, secure packaging and an awesome candle! I was a little concerned about ordering a glass candle online, fearing that it would come broken but the packaging was impeccable! I‚Äôll definitely order more."
2,25-Oct-20,5,"My favorite candle I love this scent, so fresh and pretty smelling. I was surprised at the great price on Amazon! Definitely had to buy it right away!"
2,11-May-19,5,"Smells Exactly Like Fresh Wild Lilac! My new fav scent for Spring/Summer. I was worried it would have a fake, floral smell to it but Yankee Candle captured the aroma of walking through a field of Lilac! This candle will give scent to the entire house but isn‚Äôt overwhelming in any way - very clean and fresh! Love, love, love and will buy again!"
2,22-Jul-20,3,"Great candle! Crap shipping and handling I love these candles unfortunately I was shipped two broken candles. The first was broken and amazon sent me another at no cost so I was stoked! Okay I‚Äôm gonna get another candle that isn‚Äôt broken at no cost. Okay what could go wrong? Well it came in today and it‚Äôs broken even more so than the first one. I‚Äôm just gonna go to a store and buy these from now on. This is ridiculous. Great candles I love them, just bad shipping and handling."
2,16-Aug-20,5,Brought this as a gift. Smells absolutely fantastic!!! Got this as a gift my mom and she completely loved it!!! I‚Äôd expect nothing less from Yankee Candles.
2,22-Feb-19,5,"Excellent Candle!! Great color and fragrance....burns good (love candles that liquify and not burn down the center).  Yankee Candles 2 wick soy wax tumblers are the best in my opinion.  I make candles so I am very particular about the quality and these are the best, and I've tried them all!! lol"
2,11-Apr-17,5,"Long lasting warmth! Great scent, good slow burn, wick burns well and doesn't need frequent trimming or do the ""mushroom"" thing where the flame gets huge and the wick gets a heavy head. Fills my home with a warm scent!"
2,19-Nov-18,5,"Smells great! I've bought a few Yankee Candles before and have been dissapointed because of their lack of smell . BUT this was not the case for this one. I love this candle , because it really does smell great and seems to help get's any pet odors out of my basement. Will continue to purchase in the future."
2,15-May-20,5,"GOOD SCENT I love the scent. Delivery person must have banged it on my porch, breaking jar into hundreds of pieces,I loved the fact that customer service replaced it n two days"
2,6-Nov-18,3,"Perfect shower present I've literally bought this candle for every bridal shower I've been to in the last 5 years. It's cheaper on here than it is in the Yankee Candle outlet, and packaging is perfect. I personally hate the smell of this candle....it's way too strong.... but it's really just about the label saying wedding day."
2,24-Aug-18,5,"Yankee Candles r my Favorite I burn candles every evening and when guests r coming. I love the house to smell great. This isn't to strong but strong enough to notice. My only wish is that they would last forever, Try one and see."
2,6-Mar-20,5,Love this candle Yankee candles last so much longer than bath and body. This is one of my all time favorites. Half the price of the actual yankee store & are real. Smell amazing.
2,10-Aug-19,3,"Weak smell The lavender vanilla small tumbler is pretty, but the smell is weak. I can barely smell it when it‚Äôs on my nightstand. I‚Äôm so disappointed but I‚Äôve already used it and can‚Äôt return it."
2,26-May-20,1,Melted candle I received my candle on the 23rd of may 2020 and this is how i received my Candle from Yankee candle it was exposed to heat or something and I recived like this picture attached. Not happy with my purchase
2,21-Mar-20,5,The smell is phenomenal Love the smell. Yankee candle needs to start making candle toppers again because you end up with so much black wick and your wax when you get to the bottom of the candle‚ò?Ô?è
2,3-May-20,3,Not the smell for me This candle burns great.  It‚Äôs just not a smell I liked very much.  I burned it a few times and ended up giving it to a friend who liked the smell.
2,10-Oct-20,5,Yankee Candles are the BEST! No other candle fills the room (actually my entire house) like Yankee CandleLilac Blossom is a nice light scent...
2,8-Aug-20,5,Lovely rose fragrance You can't go wrong with Yankee Candle.  This rose candle has an especially lovely fragrance like smelling a rose from the garden.
2,12-Nov-20,5,so far with burning for most of a day so far with burning for most of a day the scent is a little on the soft side compared to most candlesthe Burn down rate is real good and shows that this one is going to have a long burn life in itwould recommend them as a buy if on sale!
2,27-Oct-20,5,"Typical Yankee Candle Came very surely and well packaged so there were no worries of it breaking in transit. It‚Äôs the standard Yankee Candle: great scent, long lasting and a beautiful colour."
2,20-Apr-19,4,"Too strong I was expecting more of a delicate scent that resembled grass or something earthy. It ended up being a very potent scent that smells like my aunt's body soap. Not what I expected at all. Still smells good though, I guess."
2,25-Sep-20,5,Very fragrant The smell of lilac goes through my whole apartment no problem.
2,30-Mar-20,1,"No Jasmine Scent whatsoever This was a waste of purchase if you like jasmine scent. You can smell the jasmine if you are just smelling the wax, but when you burn it there is no jasmine scent, not even a subtle hint of it. I lit it in a small room with door closed and it didn't even smell like jasmine or like anything else. Very disappointed."
2,8-Oct-19,5,Smells AWESOME Bought this candle as a gift for my friend‚Äôs wedding day and it smells SO GOOD. Such a strong nice smell. Yankee candle never fails to do great! Would definitely recommend!
2,9-Jun-20,1,"Arrived nearly completely melted This candle arrived late, AND was leaking all over its cardboard packaging. It turned into liquid and I can‚Äôt even fish out the wick if I wanted to without mangling the whole thing. It‚Äôs an end of the year teacher gift, too, so I‚Äôm not too thrilled right now."
2,23-Jul-20,5,Fresh Cut Roses This doesn‚Äôt have a strong potent smell that gets irritating or is too powerful. Smells just like walking in the flower shop
2,29-Apr-20,2,"After a few uses, I couldn't relight it even using a blowtorch. The damn thing just refuses to burn. This was great for the first few uses or so. Good smell, very relaxing. Then it just absolutely refused to light.I tried digging the wick out to expose more of it and it just burned down. I even tried using a blowtorch on it, which got the candle to light for about 30 seconds, during which time it's spark like a firework (see video). Subsequent attempts to relight it with the blowtorch also ended in failure. Damn thing just won't burn."
2,14-May-19,5,"Purchase them before, and will purchase them again! I have always loved you and cake candles, and I'm sure you know what this product is and that it will meet your satisfaction. It is up to you to decide whether or not it's worth the cost. I'm satisfied as a customer however!"
2,27-Aug-20,5,Long lasting floral scent I usually buy these direct from YC but I just wanted one this time so I ordered here. Wowza this smells amazing!
2,14-Jul-20,5,one of my top favs!! was lucky enough to get the sale on these cause there my mothers absolute favorite :)smells great leaves the house feeling comfortable
2,9-Nov-19,1,I won‚Äôt order it again It came completely melted sideways! Awful. I will never order again because now I have to go through the hassle of returning it. It‚Äôs not allowing me to post a pic of this mess.
2,17-Nov-20,1,No scent or very little: I love Yankee candles when you can actually smell the scent of them.  The candle we are burning now we can't smell at all!  I think this was a replacement candle for another candle we got which melted all over the box or another one that arrived with a broken glass around the candle.  These are expensive candles so they definitely should have a scent to them.
2,25-May-20,5,Great Candle I love the Lavender smell! The scent isn‚Äôt overly strong where you just burn it for a limited time. It‚Äôs very pleasant and delightful.
2,22-Sep-20,5,"Love this candle and smell its super scented, so it's great! It lasts a really long time!"
2,22-May-20,5,"Great smell and slow burn Lit this candle for my bathroom.After a few hours, the wax had barely gone down leaving the bathroom smelling pleasant."
2,21-Oct-20,5,Longest lasting Yankee Candles never disappoint. Make sure to keep the wick short so they don't smoke. Love these candles
2,19-May-19,3,"Smells like soap The scent smelled like soap.  Not that it's terrible, just not as good of a smell you typically get with Yankee."
2,24-Jul-20,5,"Wonderful scent Love this scent! Been struggling to find a good summertime candle.  This is it!  If you love Yankee‚Äôs autumn wreath and pine & balsam scents, then you will love this one too!  Floral but even the boys in our family love the scent."
2,22-Mar-20,4,"Scent? Quality as always with Yankee. There is not much of a scent, I won‚Äôt order this scent again"
2,3-Mar-20,3,Minimal scent As far as the seller transaction everything was perfect.  The candle is just very lack luster. No real scent being put off. Looks nice but that's about all.
2,31-Mar-20,2,No scent Went with this as it was last yankee candle in stock. I understand why now. Overall it smells nice unfortunately doesn‚Äôt carry at all never even knew it was lit based on scent in the house.
2,19-Oct-20,1,Lack of scent When I compared this to my other Yankee candles this one did not have any smell to it hardly at all
2,26-Dec-19,5,"Burns long and slow I have never bought a Yankee candle before.  They seem overpriced.  But I took a chance guessing they were good quality.  I was right.  They burn slow and even, and the scent is strong but not overwhelming.  I like the single wicks in the small jars, am not a fan of the double wicks in the larger units but now that I see how slow they burn maybe that makes sense."
2,9-Mar-20,5,Good Good
2,9-Sep-20,4,"Good quality candle... I hate the scent Ok so I blind bought this candle... Turns out I hate the smell of lilac. Besides that, candle burned evenly and had a very strong scent throw for the short time I had it lit before realizing I hated the scent. Scent is VERY strong. If you like lilac, go crazy man, not my cup of tea."
2,18-Dec-19,5,"Excellent Gift for Yankee Candle Lover My Yankee Candle loving friend loved it; it smell fresh and not ""attacking"", fragrance lingers long after the light is snuffed out. Good for the price."
2,28-May-20,5,Smells Amazing I can‚Äôt believe how inexpensive this candle was! The scent is DIVINE - watermelon and summer in a jar! My absolute favorite Yankee Candle scent.
2,24-Aug-20,5,Great buy I love this yankee candle! It smells beautiful.
2,17-Feb-20,4,What‚Äôs not to like Candle has a very pleasant scent and last a long time
2,17-Jul-19,5,Great scent This candle has the best lilac scent of any candles I have ever bought.
2,18-Jun-20,4,Not very sturdy Jar cracked right when I pulled it out of the box and set it on the table very gently .  . Hopefully it will still burn ok.  .
2,3-Jun-17,5,"The color was perfect for her living room It was a gift, but the lady I sent it to called and said the scent filled her whole condo.  The color was perfect for her living room.  It burned evenly and slowly."
2,26-Jul-20,1,"Broken twice This is second broken (glass) candle I have received. There is no found method to request another replacement, or, money back."
2,9-May-20,5,Well worth it I love my candles and I love the beach. I put one in my bedroom & one in the living room. Great size and great product for the price.
2,10-Oct-18,5,In love with this scent Best scent ever! It smells like I imagine a waterfall in the middle of the Forrest in spring smells like. Like early morning dew on freshly mown grass.
2,27-Dec-19,5,"Great Gift! I love, love my candle, the scent that clears all other orders from the room and the warmth generated from the candle. Makes an awesome gift!"
2,31-Jan-19,2,"Wick stops burning Very disappointed as this is one of my favorite scents. However, first candle burned for 2 hours and would not burn the next day. Amazon (go Amazon) quickly sent a replacement but this one only burnt three quarters before wick won't burn anymore."
2,7-Jul-20,5,Heavenly Scented Best scent ever. Have it in my home and in my car. Longlasting and always receive compliments!
2,28-Dec-19,5,Great smelling My favorite smell
2,4-Nov-20,3,Smells wonderful The scent is wonderful but it came without a visible wick . Had to return it and request a replacement.
2,16-Oct-19,5,Great but using soy from now on. Smelled good lasted forever only used half bc the paraffin in it gave me respiratory issues. Had to give to someone else halfway thru. Paraffin is so toxic!
2,21-Mar-18,1,"This candle was pretty and smelled wonderful before it was lit This candle was pretty and smelled wonderful before it was lit. After lighting it, it was like a assult on the senses. The smell made me feel like I was eating it, then it gave me a headache, upset stomach! Not a winner in my book."
2,28-Jul-20,1,One was all melted and second one was broken I ordered two candles and both of them arrived in a very bad condition. One was melted and couldn't be used. The jar of the second one was broken and all over in the box.
2,5-Jun-20,1,Disappointed I have purchased pinks sand from the actual Yankee store and it is an amazing candle. But the candle that I purchased on amazon has absolutely no scent.
2,24-Jul-15,5,"Very sweet smelling I light this in the living room and I feel like I am sitting next to a honeysuckle! (I know the label is packaged as jasmine, but it smells a little too sweet to be just a normal jasmine.) On a side note, I quote one of my friends ""what, this doesnt smell like jasmine tea at all!"" correct, this smells like jasmine flowers...I love the smell of this candle and burn it quite a bit. The aroma spreads pretty well and the candle seems to be fairly long lasting."
2,4-Jul-20,5,"The best candle The best candle! Smells so good, has the entire house smelling good! Cute too!I always buy this"
2,24-Aug-20,4,Yanky candle This was a gift for my mom and she lives the gardenia scent. I just bought her the lavender scent.
2,27-Jul-20,1,"Mine was broken Wish i could give a real review about the smell and longevity of this candle but unfortunately mine came in broken. All i can said is that it does smells good, right when i opened the box i could smelled already. Now im returning this one and waiting for a replacement. I will update my review then."
2,11-May-20,3,"DISAPPOINTED THE SCENT WAS NOT WORTH THE COST, AND GO TO A DISCOUNT STORE AND BUY SAME CANDLE DIFFERENT LABEL FOR $7"
2,16-Feb-20,5,‚ù§Ô?è ?üëç
2,13-Nov-20,5,Real mild aroma We love the mild aroma. It wafts through our home supper soft and is relaxing...
2,30-Mar-20,5,"Finally, a lilac candle that smells like lilacs! So happy with this scented candle! It burns nice and has a good throw. Perfect to burn for that ""spring scent""!"
2,11-Jun-20,5,Mom loves it! I got this for my mom for Mother‚Äôs Day and she loves it! Smells like roses straight out of the garden. Very happy with my purchase!
2,18-Jan-13,4,"Great smell, leaves too much soot. Yankee candles are second to none, some of the best smelling candles there are. The only problem is, this particular candle uses only one wick, which is particularly thick, and if you ever burn the candle for too long and let the wick become too long, the flame starts letting off a lot of soot, which builds up in the glass, given it's shape.However, this can easily be avoided if you don't burn the candle for more then a few hours, and have a way to clip the wick with something to cut the wick deep in the jar."
2,3-Jul-19,5,Scent is clean and long-lasting. The price was only $19.99 which is a good price compared to stores. I can smell it throughout my house when I'm burning it. Another thing I like is that I can leave the house to run an errand and the scent will still be in the air when I get back.
2,15-Mar-20,5,Beautiful Gift I bought this as a gift for a friend who is getting married soon. She loved it!
2,21-Nov-19,2,Not recommended This does not smell as good as the original i bought from the store. I wonder if this is an old product or fake? I would not buy this again.
2,6-Jun-20,1,Damaged Products The candle arrived with shattered glass. They did replace it for me. The second one came with the wax all lopsided to one side. I can‚Äôt even light it.
2,23-Jun-20,4,"Pretty good candle Scent is pretty good. It‚Äôs more subtle when burning, than when you open the jar. Overall worth the money."
2,1-Jun-20,5,Smells sooo good I kept it for myself but could easily use it as a beautiful gift. Wonderful lilac scent. Would purchase again
2,7-Nov-20,2,Not lavender scent This doesn‚Äôt have a very good lavender scent. It doesn‚Äôt smell like lavender
2,3-Feb-19,5,"El aroma es espectacular Amo el aroma de esta vela, de todas las opciones que he comprado realmente ha sido la ??nica que me ha dado un resultado satisfactorio. El aroma es agradable y realmente se siente en el ambiente. La recomiendo en un 100%"
2,11-Aug-20,5,"Love this Beautiful, just what I was looking for, smells great even when you don't burn it!"
2,3-Jan-19,5,Great scent Lilac is my favorite scent and this candle is strong smelling but not overpowering. It was a great price as well.
2,31-Jul-20,5,Love it! Soft summery scent. Not overpowering .Got for great price.too. Yankee Candles reliably burns a long time too. Would purchase again.
2,2-Feb-20,1,Choose your favorite UNSCENTED color Don't expect this to give of a noticeable scent.I suppose if you risk burning your nose hairs you could notice an odor.I regret not sending them back immediately..they ain't cheap and it hurts my wallet every time I look at them.
2,5-Jan-20,5,Wonderful scent!!  Long lasting!! Good for yoga!! Gave this to my husband and when we do yoga this has a strong but tolerable wonderful scent. Will continue using this as our go to pm yoga scent.
2,7-May-20,5,Love this scent! Very strong! Smells super good and I love it. I‚Äôve bought 2 or 3 in a couple years and gave them out as gifts.
2,10-May-20,5,The smell of real lilacs is very important to me and I get this from the candle Really smells like lilacs I love it in my kitchen I had real lilacs in my kitchen when I lived in New York so this takes me back to a time when I had the real lilacs
2,3-Oct-20,5,Would recommend Love this scent. Smells like sweet lavender. Not over powering. Will buy again.
2,14-Aug-20,1,"No scent Really disappointed, was really looking forward too the scent and I smell nothing."
2,29-Jul-19,5,Wish it lasted longer This is our favorite candle.  We have a cat and it seems to be the only thing that works to hide the fact that we do.  It's on often so a warmer works better cause it burns out fast.
2,14-May-20,1,Candle was deformed upon delivery Unfortunately I am very disappointed that I received my candle today and it is warped to the point that i cannot even find the wick to light it. It looks like the candle was upside down and formed to the top so that the wick is buried and wax is oozing out of the top.I was very excited to to get my new candle and waited weeks for it and to my disappointment i cannot even use it now.
2,5-May-20,5,"Perfect mixture of fresh and sweet! This is hands down the best candle I have ever purchased.. The smell is the perfect scent of lavender, honey and the sweetness of the Gelato. The smell dispurses perfectly, not overwhelming or too highly scented. Will be buying more!"
2,12-Jul-20,2,Melted upon arrival No idea on longevity but the scent isn‚Äôt nice at all and it arrived to me in a melted puddle of wax.
2,23-Nov-19,5,Love these I just love these candles. I have buying way to many. lol great when they are on sale. Come fast. Thank you and I will be buying more.
2,2-May-20,5,Perfect for Moms Day this has a light scent that smell great.  I am gifting this my daughter via her 3 year old son.
2,13-Apr-20,1,"Broken candle This candle cams shattered to me and completely unusable. I‚Äôm happy to send a picture of it if you have an email I can send it to. But when I opened the box, it was shattered. Could you resend this candle? It‚Äôs totally ruined."
2,1-May-20,1,"Dead on arrival Opened the box only to find glass shattered and the entire top half of the glass encasing broken.... The box doesn't look damaged or shoe signs of being dropped, however the mold that this candle was in shows it was clearly broken from being dropped. Going to have to find a way to light this thing with some kind of glass jar that can hold it."
2,25-Sep-19,5,Perfect I had a smaller candle in this scent and getting this bigger jar was a great decision
2,12-Nov-20,2,No Noticeable Scent Scent barely noticeable. For the price I paid I expected a much stronger lilac smell. Highly disappointed
2,9-Nov-20,5,"Best Candles Out There I love Yankee Candle, this Lavender and Citrus and Sage are my favorite."
2,9-Nov-19,5,Great Buy - last long Love Candles. Yankee candles are the best and they last long.  Lavender is my favorite but like others too.  They really have a nice sent and not over powering.
2,10-Mar-20,5,Happy What can I say....Yankee candles are the best...period. Burns evenly as a high quality candle should and smells great.
2,22-Jul-20,5,love this Scent. I love the Yankee candles and got it for very good price.will be buying more.
2,18-Jun-20,5,Fresh Petals ?üå? 4 days pf none stop fragance.It burnt 24 hours for 4 consecutive days.Super long lasting.
2,25-May-20,1,"Scent I was so excited when I got my Lavender scented candles. But, when I lit it there was no scent at all, I have previous bought this same candle at Bed Bath and Beyond with a great scent throughout the 150 hours. Very disappointed for the price I paid for 2 candles. I couldn't submit with a zero rating so I had to pick a 1 star rating even though that is to generous."
2,19-Oct-20,5,replacement came right away First candle came had the top snapped off around the glass and broke a bunch of it.  this replacement was immediatly shipped and arrived in great condition
2,12-Jul-19,5,I love it Love everything about Yankee Candles. Pink Sands is one of my favorites. Great longevity. Great scent. One large candle lasts me about a week with constant use.
2,15-May-20,1,"Not happy For some reason, I could not smell the candle. I have never had this problem with Yankee Candle before. I returned it."
2,10-Oct-20,1,Candle had been lit before receipt. This is the first time I have ever had a problem with Amazon delivery. The candle had been lit before and the wick was black. The person who got it said there was also an oil stain in the wrapping.
2,21-Feb-20,5,Scents Cant go wrong with yankee candles. I absolutely love their scents. They have never disappointed me so far.
2,22-Mar-18,4,"Nice smelling, in fact this candle will smell up ... Nice smelling, in fact this candle will smell up  an entire room  which I love. But it's so big it becomes hard to light as it burns down.Just know that and I think you'll enjoy it."
2,22-Mar-20,5,"smells so uplifting! This is an exchange for a fragrance I didn't like at all. It arrived quickly, packaged well, and smells beautiful. I'll buy more from this seller."
2,14-Nov-20,5,Love Perfect & way cheaper price than going to the Yankee candle store !
2,18-Jun-20,5,"love roses...you'll love this.. Wonderful scent, I love rose fragrance, and in just about 15 minutes..the area smells like a room of roses ?üå?...love it!"
2,7-Oct-20,5,My favorite candle! I absolutely love this lilac scent! Its the best one I've found!
2,5-Dec-17,5,"Gentle, clean fragrance This is by far my favorite home fragrance. I love the clean scent and get complimented on the light fragrance all the time. I use the candle in conjunction with the scented beads and electric scented outlets."
2,17-Dec-18,1,No scent This candle has no scent. It was a total waste of money. I bought 6 candles as Christmas gifts. I will not be giving them to the intended recipients . Totally disappointed. I‚Äôll be going to Bath and Body Works. Their candles ALWAYS smell nice. Shame on Yankee Candle!
2,27-May-20,3,"Warm day, candle delivered melted Not sure what I was expecting, ordering a scent that I never smelled before. But the candle is a little too floral and strong to my liking.  Candle came on the hottest day of the year, melted. Probably won‚Äôt even use it."
2,1-Feb-19,5,"Help keep the home warm this winter! Burn some jar candles! If you close your eyes while this is lit, it smells just like your in a lush summer rose garden, candle doesn‚Äôt smoke, wick is high quality so you‚Äôll get every last hour out of these jars. Yankee is one of the best!"
2,5-Oct-10,3,"Not lavender... but smells good.  Yankee candle quality. I am very picky about my lavender products... always looking for things that contain pure essential oils of lavender.  I even grow three different species of lavender...so I think I know what lavender smells like.Yankee candles are among my favorites for quality candles in a huge variety of scents.  They burn evenly and cleanly.  I was excited to try their lavender candle.However, this is not lavender.  The lavender and vanilla candle by Yankee has more lavender than this... and even then that candle is vanilla dominant. This candle is very floral... reminds me of a flowery soap that was lavender colored and trying to be 'lavender'.  It smells good... it smells clean... it smells feminine... and it is yankee quality... but I am sorry, this isn't lavender."
2,21-Aug-20,2,Not much scent Barely any scent and this candle was gone in a few weeks of use. Sounds like they have retooled the formula and lost their strong lovely scents. On to a new brand.
2,25-May-19,5,Got this for Mother's Day Great gift for Mother's Day. Smells exactly like it says.
2,17-Aug-20,5,Love the Scent!! A favorite scent in our family and the candle lasts a long time.
2,3-Feb-19,5,"One of my favorites and cheaper here on amazon. Love this scent! It's a light floral lilac smell and it smells very fresh and clean. It is not overwhelming either, as I do not like really strong fragrances. Cheaper here on Amazon than at the store, worth buying on here for sure."
2,22-Jul-20,5,Great gift Great gift but better prices available at yankee when they run deals.
2,13-Aug-20,3,Bad smell. Smell not as I thought it would be. Don‚Äôt really use it now.
2,15-Nov-20,2,Smells more like flowers than beachy The scent is too flowery....not enough beachy as expected. Bought on sale so it's ok.
2,20-May-20,5,"Great present! Great scent (not too strong), lasted a long time and will be buying more for Christmas gifts!"
2,11-Jan-20,5,Wonderful fragrance! This candle smells great and is a very pretty color.  I find that the Yankee candles always burn very nicely!
2,12-Aug-20,5,Great scent Lasted longer than other Yankee candles and burnt all the way down. Great scent. Will buy again.
2,16-Oct-20,5,"The smell amazing They are long lasting and smell amazing, if you are a guy and don't have any candle this is great.Just use it when you need it like date night, or when friends or family comes over and you places will smell great.They last for over 2 month of noncontinuous use."
2,20-Apr-20,5,Treat yourself!!! This candle smells amazing! I can honestly see why these candles are so expensive.
2,25-Dec-19,5,"Great scent, long lasting Bought it on sale and it was an amazing value for this candle. Lasts a long timeaand makes my whole 900 sq foot apartment smell great"
2,18-Feb-20,5,"Really nice refreshing pretty scent Really pretty scent.  I think it's perfect for a bedroom or bathroom.  Nice throw, especially the large size.  Great price here on Amazon."
2,31-Dec-19,5,Smells wonderful. It smells just like lilacs. It‚Äôs not a  heavy scent but it‚Äôs a wonderful touch of spring in the wintertime.
2,22-Jan-20,5,"Love the Gardenia This is my favorite scent in any candle, spray, oil. So glad it's available. It's long lasting because it's Yankee"
2,17-Nov-20,5,"Smells amazing! The flame was really tall! Besides that, the candle smells amazing. I was just very shocked at how tall the flame is every time I light it."
2,30-Sep-20,3,Smells great but was melted Received candle and opened it and the wax had melted while the candle was on its side and was all over the lid.
2,18-Jul-20,1,"It's broken It's really upsetting that it's broken. The glass is everywhere. I just did my surgery, and I wanted candles to relax. But it seems impossible. I also got my fingers cut because of the glass. I don't want to go to the store to return them, I can't really move and I don't feel safe to go to public area. Really sad, hope someone can help."
2,20-Mar-17,5,I love the scent of this candle on days when I ... I love the scent of this candle on days when I can open a window and door. It enhances those delicious smells from the outside garden.
2,11-May-20,4,Good product Love the smell of it but when it is burning this fragrance is very light
2,28-Apr-20,5,Worth the money! Absolutely love this candle. Smells fresh and feminine and burns for hours.
2,16-May-20,1,"Smelled Awful! I love the smell of beautiful lilac flowers.  If you like lilacs, you won't like this!  It had an extremely strong, harsh perfume odor that was very irritating.  So irritating that when I held it up to open and smell it, I recoiled and accidentally dropped and smashed the glass container.  What a waste of money!"
2,7-Nov-19,1,"Very little smell at all Very little sent at all. It was lit time in about 5 hours the second time and in a small bedroom, it was almost unnoticeable."
2,17-Feb-19,1,Are these actually real Yankee Candles? I purchased Clean Cotton and Beach Walk. Both barely have any scent at all. I sometimes buy their cheaper brand from the drug store and they have way more scent. Will stick with those in the future rather than blowing my money on the original Yankee Candles. I'm not even convinced that this is real product unless it has greatly declined in quality?
2,25-Jan-20,4,Very nice smell Recommend it to anyone good price that's what got me plus great smell just wish it lasted longer.
2,26-Sep-19,1,Complete waste! Arrive shattered I ordered two of my favorite candle and they sent one that was completely shattered. There was broken glass leaking out of the box. I couldn't even take it out without cutting myself.  complete mess.
2,15-May-17,5,"Love, love, love!! Love this candle! Bought one for me and one for my mom, who loved it too! Nice, fresh, strong scent that fills multiple rooms! I highly recommend this candle. Long burn time!"
2,2-Oct-20,1,Bummer It was broken and just one and I almost cut myself
2,15-Aug-20,3,"Perfume ? Pretty color but perfume is a bit confusing, don‚Äôt care for it very much"
2,12-Mar-18,5,Five Stars Smells like a real gardenia without being overpowering. Would definitely repurchase.
2,29-Apr-20,4,Good value Good value. Bought as a gift and the recipient really liked the scent
2,19-Feb-13,4,"REAL ROSES! Next to Yankee's discontinued Salt Mist Rose, this is my favorite rose fragrance. Light yet lasting, and somehow fresh-smelling. The only problems with ANY of my recent Yankee candles have been with the wicks. Has Yankee changed their wick? The candles burn about halfway and then the wicks get horribly carbonized and start sending out black soot. I trim my wicks with regularity, but somehow they always end up a mess. This never used to happen with Yankee."
2,18-Oct-20,5,Amazing! I gifted this to my friend for her birthday and she loved it! It had a nice strong rose-apricot scent and it was delivered with no damage at all. Great buy!
2,12-May-20,1,No smell Very disappointed with the candle. Doesn‚Äôt have any smell. Will not recommend buying
2,19-Apr-18,5,"Smells great. A little sweet Smells great. A little sweet, clean summer scent. I haven't smelled anything else similar. Long burn time and the frangrance feels the room. I watch the Yankee candles for price drops and then order - I find them to be a little pricey."
2,20-Mar-20,5,Awesome This candle had the most lovely scent! I bought it originally for a gift. But when it arrived I loved it too much to give it away. ?üòâ
2,29-Aug-20,5,Beautiful Yankee Candle I gave the candle as a gift and my friend loved it. She thought the scent was delightful.
2,18-Feb-20,5,I highly recommend I love these! I burned it every day for 2 weeks and then cleaned out the jar to hold my makeup brushes.
2,27-Apr-20,5,Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle Lilac Blossoms I love this candle. The scent is relaxing and the candle lasts a long time. I have bought a few Yankee Candles from Amazon and I've loved them all.
2,18-Jul-19,5,"Lovely Love this product! Like most Yankee products, this is a tried and true scent. I just moved into a new home and this is a great touch!"
2,27-Feb-20,5,Excellent product! Fragrance fabulous! Product is excellent! The scent is very soothing and I always get compliments when I light this particular candle.
2,27-Nov-19,1,No smell at all This is sad I used to buy this candles and loved them this one smells like nothing not even in a small bedroom with a candle lit for hours can you feel the scent. I had to buy another brand. Too bad. Not even if they where free would I get them again.
2,27-May-20,3,Okay but doesn‚Äôt smell like lavender at all. I was looking for something that smells like real lavender. This does not.
2,21-Mar-20,4,Yummy smell Smells yummy but started to burn unevenly halfway thru (couldn‚Äôt keep it lit anymore). But gorgeous and heavy for gifting!! Nice
2,4-Mar-20,5,Smells so good Yankee candles are the best and this was way cheaper than in stores. Definitely recommend.
2,29-Jul-19,1,"Smells like a very old very smelly old lady that is just old. This just smells so, SO BAD. NOT like fresh cut roses in any way. Like horrible old lady rose scent. And it is so strong. Regret!"
2,18-May-15,5,Yankee Jar Candle This Yankee Jar Candle is a lot of candle. I purchased this for my wife and she really enjoys it. The fresh cut roses smells exactly as it sounds it would. This thing burns and burns and burns and hardly any has been used up. It's about a year old now and I would say 80% is left unused. She lights it up for about an hour on the weekends.
2,25-Sep-20,5,"Love this smell! The first candle they sent me broke in transit, but they sent a second one out right away! I love the smell of this candle!"
2,1-Oct-20,5,Strong scent! My favorite  candle and favorite  scent
2,24-Sep-20,5,Yankee lilac Amazing fragrance
2,9-Sep-20,1,No smell This one is my favorite but this one has no smell!!!
2,30-Nov-18,5,"hours or beautiful smells I love candles, especially Yankee candles. They burn for hours and hours on end and will leave the room smelling fantastic. When my boyfriend forgets to take out the garbage I light these up while I take it out and clean up a little and the garbage smells is gone within 15 minutes."
2,15-Apr-20,1,"Received candle with broken jar I just received the Yankee candle & unfortunately the bottle was cracked. Was going to send back but with what's going on at this time with the virus, it's too much of a hassle !!! I do really like Yankee candles but disappointed it came this way. I will try to salvage as much of the candle as I can  ?üòû"
2,28-Feb-20,5,One of my favorites Got this for my grandma (its one of my favorite scents) and she loved it
2,3-Jul-20,5,Smells wonderful Smells wonderfulAbsolutely wonderful
2,13-Feb-20,5,"Love it! Favorite scent, this is what I love about amazon. When you cant find it in the shop you'll find it here."
2,12-Jan-20,5,Good all around scent for gifts Arrived just fine and grandmother loved it. One of the only candles she's asked us to look for specifically out of many scents we've given her.
2,11-Aug-20,1,Received broken glass all inside box. Second time in a row this jar was broken when I received it.Zero Stars.
2,16-Apr-10,5,"fragrant, calming The scent of Lavender is noted for it's calming properties. I truly enjoy the aroma of this scented candle and Yankee Candle, in my opinion, is the best. The jar never gets hot and putting the cap in place while the wick is still lit is a convenient way to extinguish the flame without the smokey smell one gets when a candle is simply blown out.  I have tried numerous other lavender candles and none have been as fragrant or satisfying as Yankee Candle."
2,26-Apr-20,5,"Like this I LOVE !!I love the smell of jesmine in the house. If you leave it on when you can't sleep, you'll fall asleep."
2,5-Mar-18,3,Strong smell Beach walk is too heavy of a smell. It's OK and I can  burn it for an hour but the smell will last a day. It does not smell like a Beach Walk either.
2,3-Jan-20,5,My favorite scent Smells so good and fills a room well. Seems like it'll last me quite a while so I'm very happy.
2,16-Aug-18,5,Smells wonderful Smells wonderful!
2,17-Nov-20,5,My Favorite Candle!!! I absolutely love everything about Yankee Candle! One of my favorite scents is Pink Sands. I use this in my bedroom often. It will change the smell of any room and it is not overwhelming at all. I also love to use the products that keep my vehicle smelling amazing.
2,22-May-19,5,Good candle Smells great burns clean.
2,8-Mar-20,5,"Love it Love this candle. It smells amazing.  Wish it was 2 or 3 wicks, but still love it"
2,29-Apr-20,5,Brilliant! Great Product. Quick Shipping. Excellent Seller!!!!!
2,21-May-20,5,beautiful fragrance Very nice fragrance but not over powering lovely ?üòä
2,23-May-20,2,"Not worth the price. This candle smells great, HOWEVER the scent is no stronger than a Walmart brand candle. Not worth the price!!!!"
2,8-Jun-20,3,"Price was right, but my wifr did not like the scent Good thing this could be regifted. It was."
2,8-Aug-18,5,"Lovely scent and perfect as a gift I bought this for a friend's 65th birthday. She likes roses and has burned this several times already, telling me that the scent is lovely. I expect quality from Yankee Candle and this delivers."
2,21-Jun-18,5,Smells just like the lilac trees in New England Love this candle filled the whole house with the smell of lilac made me feel like I was back in New England( live in Phoenix now)
2,12-Jun-19,5,"Love Pink Sands I love Yankee Candles, they are bar far the best I have purchased in many years.  Love the Pink Sands scent. Will be heartbroken when they discontinue it."
2,29-Jan-18,5,"Nice, fresh smell! This candle smells absolutely wonderful. It's perfect to freshen up my bedroom!"
2,30-Sep-20,5,amazing sent!! lasts longer than expected and seems to be a hit with everyone that comes into my office.
2,21-Apr-19,5,"Smells great, not overwhelming I bought this to relax. Lavander is known for its calming effect. Yankee candle jars burn well. If you use a lampshade, remember to wipe the soot off."
2,5-Jun-17,3,"DISAPPOINTED IS PUTTING IT MILDLY.... I bought the name.  I was NOT happy with it at all.  The smell was nice when you smelled the candle, but burning you could hardly smell.  Love the White Barn candles as they smell awesome and got so many compliments even when it hadn't been burning that day!  Very disappointed."
2,22-Nov-19,2,Disappointed It has no smell. It‚Äôs my favorite scent and I can not smell it at all. Was very disappointed.
2,6-May-20,3,Doesn‚Äôt really smell like lilacs Scent is okay. Doesn‚Äôt really smell like lilacs.
2,13-Jan-20,2,Total Waste of Money! I mean it definitely burns and sort of smells but NOTHING like my Yankee Candles usually do. I‚Äôm used to being able to smell my candle outside of my room and I can barely smell this candle when it sits on my nightstand and I‚Äôm in my bed. Total waste of money!
2,27-Oct-20,3,No scent Wasn't impressed by scent
2,7-Sep-19,5,My new favorite candle will be ordering over and over My favorite candle ever purchased it here on Amazon first simply because it was pink and that‚Äôs my favorite color LOL
2,22-Jun-20,5,What can i say its yankee candle Great scent smells like fresh cut flowers love this scent
2,17-Jan-20,5,Beautiful scent..low throw Beautiful apricot and Rose scent. The throw is low though unless you burn in a smaller room.
2,25-Dec-18,5,Great price! Yankee Candle is a great candle but usually too expensive for my budget. This purchase was almost half price of retail so I was able to buy my Mom two for Christmas.
2,2-Jun-20,5,Scent lasts to end Love these candles!  Scent lasts to end!
2,5-Jan-20,5,Love this scent Love this scent and the price I got it for. You can‚Äôt beat yankee candles
2,20-May-18,5,This candle is perfect Heavenly gardenia scent and long lasting.
2,10-Jan-20,5,Smells so good!!! My most favorite candle they make. Sweet  fresh sent. Strong but not overpowering. Burns evenly.
2,16-May-18,5,Love the Lavender scent Love the Lavender scent. So disappointed they have discontinued the pure Lavender and the pure Lemon scents. There are mixed scents available now but they are not the same!
2,28-Sep-19,5,Perfect gift My mom wants more of this for her birthday now. I bought It for a Mother‚Äôs Day gift and she is a picky person. So now i am going to buy a bigger one for her.
2,24-Oct-20,5,Wonderful fragrance!! I LOVE the scent of this candle!! I have purchased this one multiple times.  I've had both a double and single wick candle.
2,29-Apr-18,5,"Great candle Arrived well packaged. The candle burned nicely and had a nice soft scent that filled the room. Though since it was a one wick candle it did take awhile for an even melt to form, but otherwise it was wonderful!"
2,16-Jan-20,5,Incredible value I got these at three for $18.  I can't remember if it was a lightning deal or not.  But that's crazy cheap compared to the actual store.
2,20-Aug-13,5,"Fragrant and long lasting. I gifted this candle to my sister for her birthday in June.  I imagined her lighting it on her patio at night, enjoying the fragrance of jasmine. This is exactly how she enjoys this candle. She loves the scent. She is still enjoying it in August. Yankee candles are the most fragrant, however, in my opinion, expensive.  Hoping that someone gifts me one of these lovely candles.  Perfect candle gift."
2,9-Mar-20,5,Beautiful rose scent and long lasting Strong scent of roses the whole time it burned. And it lasted for over 90 hours!
2,20-Sep-20,5,Great scent of lilacs! Long lasting scent ‚Äî really smells like lilacs! Love it!
2,24-May-19,5,Long burning with wick trimming and candle topper. Lovely lavender scent. Color shown is exactly same as one received
2,27-May-19,5,Another satisfied Customer Good product great service
2,19-Oct-18,1,"Broken I can hear the  shattered glass pieces even before I open the package. I understand delivery people work so hard everyday, but maybe the should pay more attention on the  fragile  items."
2,9-Dec-19,5,Great Love the scent Pink Sands. Arrived securely packaged. Candle is a good size.
2,27-Nov-19,5,"Favorite scent This candle smells nothing like pink sand... granted, I don‚Äôt know what pink sand smells like. I just doubt it smells like this. I‚Äôm guessing this candle smells WAY better. So try it out. Don‚Äôt sniff the pink sand."
2,25-Aug-12,5,"WONDERFUL!!! I love this scent! I bought this as a gift to my grandmother, it is her all time favorite scent in the world. She has only had one gardenia candle her whole life and she uses it very sparingly. Anyways, the candle she had is almost out and I was going to buy her the same brand but they sadly discontinued this scent of theirs:( So I went to amazon to look and they didn't have the same brand. I found this one by Yankee Candle and it smells even better! Just opening the jar will fill up your room with the scent for a few minutes. I will continue to buy this one from now on. Thank you amazon for selling this!"
2,26-Feb-20,5,Lovely smell! I absolutely love this scent! I'm a pet owner so coming into my house and being able to smell this candle in my candle warmer from the front door is refreshing. And couldn't beat the price of it either!
2,26-Jun-20,1,"Want good quality. Amazon needs to run the business or shut down. Yeah Bezos See comment on the other candle I bought. Don‚Äôt care for them.Overpriced,poor quality wicks wasn‚Äôt in the center of candle.I have been buying and burning candles for many years.Yankee doesn‚Äôt have the same good quality it use too ?üòü"
2,12-Jun-20,2,Pretty but too sweet Too sweet for me but a beautiful color.
2,3-Aug-19,3,Not Very Aromatic This candle has very little aroma. In fact the lavender is almost undetectable. Very disappointing for a Yankee candle.
2,26-Aug-20,5,All time Favorite I love the scent of pink sands is so beautiful ‚ù§Ô?è The only candle scent I buy.
2,19-May-20,5,Prices vary. Prices seem to fluctuate with the season.
2,17-Nov-20,5,So nice Such a nice added gift
2,2-Nov-20,5,Calming scent The smell is very nice and calming but the scent is not very strong. It takes a long time to smell the scent. I still like it a lot but I wish they can make the scent a bit stronger.
2,6-Feb-19,2,"Fake Yankee Candle!? I am not loving how this ‚ÄúYankee‚Äù candle is burning. When I buy them from YankeeCandle.com this NEVER happens, they burn all around and nice like they should. If these are not real Yankee Candle that‚Äôs total BS!"
2,16-Aug-20,5,the best i love this candle soooo much the scent is  strong and amazing
2,21-May-19,5,Great gifts Smells Great
2,23-Nov-19,5,2 wicks is better than one! My fave scent. 2 wicks means you use all of the wax which is a better value.
2,7-Sep-20,1,Good scent Arrived cracked
2,10-Jan-20,5,Love the Scent and worth the cent I love this scent.  These candles are long lasting and retain the scent.  Great gift.
2,14-May-20,3,"Strong Scent My mom loves this scent, but it‚Äôs a bit strong to the rest of us. It covers cooking smells well though!"
2,11-Mar-20,5,"Wonderful. It filled the bill, so to speak and made a delightful Christmas gift."
2,6-Mar-20,5,Buy when on sale. Awesome candles! Price is a bit steep but well worth it when on sale.
2,22-Aug-20,5,Price Price was good.
2,14-Feb-19,5,it's just okay I like this scent but the candle wicks on this particular scent is awful short and burns down faster than  harvest apple and lemon lavendar
2,25-Oct-20,4,Smells Great Very nice scent!
2,3-Sep-20,4,Candle Great smelling and wonderful price
2,23-Jun-19,5,Good price continue to buy . Love the scent My favorite scent. Good price
2,8-Apr-20,4,"Love this scent, but the candle was noticeably misshapen at the top. I love Yankee Candles and was happy to find one of my favorite scents especially for the price.  However, I was a little disappointed that the wax was misshapen and there is a small hole on the top of the candle, not the quality I usually get from either Yankee Candle or Amazon."
2,20-Aug-20,5,Smell is good This really nice and good fragrance
2,26-Oct-18,5,Read review A lady described it like the smell of bug spray. She was pretty accurate. Has a raid twang!
2,11-Jul-20,2,"the candle is beautiful, but broken The candle is beautiful, but the glass is all broken. There is no way to contact vendor, and we can't get new candle unless we send broken one back. The candle is all broken glass and we cannot send back. It would be nice to get a candle that isn't broken. Now we are out the money we spent of a broken candle."
2,4-Aug-20,5,Price changed Purchased candle at $16.88. Received and was pleased. Then a couple of days later noticed same candle was being sold at $13.00. So I purchased a second one. Why the difference in price?
2,12-Jul-20,5,scent i live burning candles
2,6-Nov-19,5,"Smells Great The scent is wonderful, it burns evenly and last for a long period of time."
2,28-Sep-20,1,broken glass all over Product was shattered- both the lid and the jar containing the candle. This candle was packed in a larger individual box than the other 2.
2,16-Mar-20,3,Just not what I thought it would smell like. Not loving the sent to much. But it will do.
2,6-Feb-18,5,"Super sweet and tart Super sweet and tart, my boyfriend loves it, I will definitely keep this one stocked. I don‚Äôt get much lavender from it but that‚Äôs ok, it reminds me of candy."

2,5-Nov-20,5,"Realistic Scent This candle was a gift for a flower lover, and he loved it. The product was good, but the shipping made half of the wax shift to one side."
2,26-Jul-19,5,Good candle but don‚Äôt buy the car  yankee candle because it smells like crap Love this smell  although don‚Äôt buy the car fragrance because you can‚Äôt return it and it smells like crap
2,4-Jul-19,2,"Nice color, weak scent Not the strongest of scents. Smells good but just not strong enough. I can‚Äôt tell it‚Äôs even burning."

I personally like tree and nature scents but this one smells like bubblegum or pink starbursts, not overpowering, just sweet and uplifting like a good piece of candy :)"
2,29-Jan-20,5,Great buy Just love the smell so much soft yet fills the room
2,20-Aug-20,2,"Came deformed The candle arrived melted into the lid.... Haven't figured out how to light the deformed candle. Smells decent, but doesn't quite have the same fresh bite of real lilacs."
2,24-Mar-16,5,"My favorite, favorite My favorite, favorite, FAVORITE candle. Smells like actual lilac, not cloying or overpowering at all. The scent fills the room, and it literally smells like a lilac bush after a spring rain. I get so many compliments on this candle."

2,30-Jun-20,5,"AMAZING Smells AMAZING, and lasts forever!"
2,7-Jan-18,4,"Amazing quality. My wife did not like smell. Even though everyone seems to like this scent. My wife did not like it. She said that it smells like a fancy public restroom. I did like it.She has loved the other scents like Christmas cookie, sugared pumpkin, vanilla cupcake..."

2,7-Feb-20,5,This candle fragrance is wonderful. The fragrance is soft and smell wonderful when you burn it.
2,13-Jan-20,5,"Pleasant scent I didnt know what to expect scent-wise from the pink sands, but I am very pleased. Nothing to sharp or  flowery or overpowering.  Just a nice clean scent."
2,2-Jan-20,5,Candle Bought as a gift go Christmas my daughter‚Äôs favorite
2,14-Sep-20,3,Bad packaging? Was looking forward to smelling this.  Item broken.
2,22-Sep-19,2,Lavender candle has no throw The Lavender candle has no throw at all. I thought Yankee Candle was supposed to be a good brand. But I guess it's back to BBW.
2,6-Nov-20,1,"No scent throw No scent throw,  very disappointed"
2,4-Aug-20,2,"Can barely smell it... The candle arrived in good condition (I think) but you can barely smell it.  For such an expensive candle, I expected much more.  My home is small and I had the candle in the entryway.  When lit for 30+ minutes, you could barely smell it.I would not recommend."
2,4-Sep-20,5,Nice smelling candle This candle was large. The smell was light and soothing. Would purchase again.
2,26-Jan-20,5,Value Great product. Great scent. Longevity is ok.
2,12-Jul-20,4,candle great scent
2,29-Feb-20,4,Relaxing Smells lovely. Just wish it would last longer
2,4-Dec-18,2,Disappointed with lack of fragrance I have a very good sense of smell and after reading the reviews I had hoped for a candle that was actually FRAGRANT... The lavender/vanilla candle I ordered does not emit any fragrance. I will stick with my Scentsy dealer.
2,25-Jan-17,5,You've got to love them! I ordered 2 - Macintosh and White Gardenia - so they both get the same review.  Who doesn't love Yankee Candles?  They were even delivered a day early!
2,2-Mar-19,5,Great buy beautiful scent I love this scent. I bought it for $12.99 so it was a great buy. I would never buy Yankee candles for more then $12.99
2,4-Sep-20,5,Lilac perfection! Great candle. They packaged the candle extremely well. Nice fragrance.
2,18-Nov-20,5,Help to make it last longer The wicks kept burning out
2,7-May-20,5,Gift I purchased this for my mother and she loved it.
2,15-Jan-20,5,Arrived as Described. Came as described. Delivered quickly via Amazon Prime.
2,4-Oct-20,2,"Disappointed The scent is nice, though you literally have to hold the jar up to your nose to smell any fragrance. To no avail, I lit the candles numerous time for several hours. Faint, faint smell...so very disappointing."
2,25-Feb-20,5,Love it Love the scent..  using it in the bathroom.  Color is as pictured.  Lovely
2,24-Sep-20,5,AMAZINGGG Our favorite scent!! It burns slowly and omits an enormous amount of deliciousness!
2,11-Jul-20,4,"Arrived broken! Arrived broken and there isn‚Äôt a choice for me to return this. Now I‚Äôm stuck paying for an expensive, broken candle I cannot use. ?üëé?üè?"
2,21-Nov-20,3,Could have done better for the price.. Size as expected. Scent was less on the lavender and heavier on the candle scent.
2,20-Nov-19,5,always a good deal and the smell is great Great candle love the Yankee namebrand and they last you for a good while.
2,1-Jul-20,5,"Smmmmmmellllls wonderful! Scent is terrifico, and candle is burning now, everyday this great smell reaches all thru house, and will try others eventually ,if this one ever burns out?!"
2,6-May-16,5,Nice Aroma for bedroom. Candle smells great and my wife really likes how it makes our bedroom smell at night.  Amazon did a poor job of packing the item though because it arrived broken with glass everywhere.  I didn't want to bother cutting myself trying to send it back so we kept it and are just real careful when lighting it.
2,5-Jul-19,5,Ya truck ya Absolutely loyal to this scent ! The only one I've bought in years and it's on PRIME .. score !!!!!
2,13-Nov-20,5,Great product Came well packaged.  Great scent
2,2-May-20,4,"Smeels Good Candle smells good, but the method of delivery stating: 'handed to the individual' - is simply not true. This could cause problems for other customers down the road so just keep your eyes peeled for it."
2,29-Mar-19,3,"Ok Smells great but didn't burn very evenly, completely or slowly. Nice scent but not enough value for the money."
2,4-Dec-19,5,Amazing Gift for my mother who will only use yankee candles
2,29-Dec-19,5,Long lasting scent One of my favorite scents from Yankee candles
2,22-Jan-20,5,Pink Sands .. I love Pink Sands..my favorite scent from Yankee Candle

2,7-Oct-19,1,product not as illustrated - may be older version I today received the Yankee Candle Wedding Day Candle however the picture on the front was not as illustrated - it was gold / yellow and color and appears to be an older version of the candle I ordered (see pic above which is light and airy looking).Thank you
2,15-May-17,3,"The scent is absolutely lovely. However, the throw ... The scent is absolutely lovely. However, the throw is so little that I could be 5 feet away from this candle and have no idea that is is up and burning. (And I live in a small apartment, so there are rarely competing smells!)"
2,28-Aug-13,5,"Very Nice Smell I typically get all my candles from Bath and Body Works and follow all the sales. Jasmine is one of my favorite scents and have been unable to get something with it for a while so I gave this a shot. It's not my favorite combo, but anything with Jasmine in it can never go wrong. Smell is relaxing and definitely can fill a room. I recommend it!"
2,7-Oct-19,2,"NO  reorder! I was disappointed with scent or I should say,lack of scent."
2,23-Jun-20,1,Na Na
2,11-May-16,5,"The Best Candle, Hands Down! This candle is a repeated purchase of mine. I buy  nothing else for my home but fresh cut roses by Yankee because the scent is powerful but not overpowering to the senses. It fills the entire great room with a fresh inviting smell that is soothing."
2,11-Aug-19,2,It doesn‚Äôt smells like gardenia! I‚Äôm disappointed at this gardenia scent! It does not smells like it all!
2,4-Sep-20,1,Very rushed in making it or melted during the mailing process I don‚Äôt know?ü§î?ü§¶?üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ?è MY Beach walk candle Picture says it all ?ü§¶?üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ?èvery dissatisfied with the way it arrived I will be resending this back I do love how it came super fast after ordering it salted caramel seems a bit rushed in making it as well ?ü§¶?üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ?è
2,24-May-17,5,"Love, Love, Love. Love my Yankee candles.  It was my gift of choice to my daughter and granddaughters on Mother's Day.  I even gifted myself with one, then purchased additional items directly with Yankee Candles because they were offering deep discounts."

2,29-Oct-20,1,Broken Product came broken in the package and glass was everywhere. Essentially unusable at this point.
2,23-Sep-19,5,"The scent is amazing Loved this scent, and really great job with the packing"
2,7-Jun-19,1,NO SCENT There is no way that this is a yankee candle. My Walmart 5.00 candles smell stronger than this

2,9-Aug-17,5,"Yankee Candles rock! LUV it! I can't stand overpowering, fake-like smells and Yankee Candle is the only product I ever buy. It smells natural and does not overpower my apartment. This is the first time trying the pink sands scent, but once again...perfection!"
2,10-Feb-20,5,Unbelievable value Absolutely love yankee candles and this is one of the best scents!
2,2-Sep-19,5,This is a must have if you like floral One of my favorite scents EVER! It doesn‚Äôt smell overly waxy. Instead it smells like fresh flowers.

2,19-Apr-18,5,Very happy with purchase ! Beautiful scent. Can't wait to use this often in the summer months. My family really enjoys it. It's crisp and clean. Not overpowering but fragrances very nicely.
2,7-Apr-20,3,"Weak Scent; Very Little Throw When I removed the lid of the candle,  I could barely smell the scent, and I love the Pink Sands scent.  After burning the candle for over 4 hours, there still was hardly any throw.  I think maybe the candle was old??? I don't know. Surely disappointing, but it's fine."
2,21-May-19,5,Great scent to light up before bed Lavender is the best!
2,18-Jun-17,4,Four Stars It's a pretty color and does have a lovely lilac scent.  Just a bit pricey for what it is.
2,24-Oct-18,4,Four Stars Always more than satisfactory.
2,16-Jan-20,5,Nice scent Not as powerful as other Yankee candles.
2,27-May-20,3,Not as expected Smell goed aways after few use
2,11-May-19,2,Not worth the price. Very disappointed by this candle.  The strength of the scent was much weaker than I expected.
2,2-Feb-20,5,Great! Quality as always
2,20-May-17,5,"Smells nice. Yankee Candle has done it again, they just make the best candles.  The white gardenia has a very soothing aroma and is very relaxing.  I will be trying a few of their other aromas to place all over my home for every room."
2,18-Mar-19,5,Smells Great It arrived quickly and in perfect condition. It smells amazing and burns for a long time. My only complaint is that there were air bubbles pressed agaist the glass that made the appearance of the candle a little less pristine.
2,27-Oct-20,2,Disappointed. Always had a good experience with yankee candle. This scent is very weak like the cover was left off for a while.
2,19-May-19,5,Lovely scent This is one of my favoriteYankee candles!! The scent is fresh and light.
2,23-Aug-19,5,"Yankee is the finest, bar none Yankee is the only candle worth buying, on my opinion."
2,9-Nov-19,5,"Patience is worth having It takes a few hours to get the candle scent to spread the first time, but well worth the wait :)"
2,26-Feb-19,5,"Best Lavender Candle ever! I absolutely love the smell of this lavender candle. It's so soothing, relaxing & invigorating, it had my entire room smelling fabulous. Great for burning at night time."
2,4-Jan-18,5,This candle is my favorite. I was given one as a gift and ... This candle is my favorite.  I was given one as a gift and have been looking for one ever since. There are no stores locally so this was a perfect fix for my wooosi moments

2,6-Aug-16,5,"Yankee Candles I absolutely love these candles.  They are a little expensive, but well worth the money.  When I walk into my bedroom, where I have them, the whole room is fragrant with the most delicious scent.  I will be ordering Yankee Candle from Amazon for many years to come."
2,25-Feb-20,3,"Great scent but not strong enough I love the scent of pink sands, but if you're trying to scent up a large room it's barely noticeable. ?üò´"
2,29-Aug-20,1,Arrived shattered in many pieces Arrived shattered in hundreds of small pieces. I was afraid to open the box. There was not enough padding or shipping product to prevent breakage.
2,25-Nov-19,5,Great Lasted long and smelled great!
2,12-Jun-20,5,Gift Gift
2,31-Dec-19,3,Yankee Candle losing its smell. My favorite fragrance Fresh Cut Roses loses its smell half way through burning the large jar candle. I am switching to medium jar size as they seem to stay fragrant longer. Very disappointed in the large candle losing fragrance half way through burning the candle. Beware.
2,20-Dec-19,5,"Yankee Doodle Dandy! Great smell, great product!"
2,28-Mar-20,4,Looks attractive but weak in the fragrance dept <eom>
2,3-Feb-19,5,Cheaper than at the store and smells amazing. This is way cheaper here than at the store. This scent is my favorite. It smells very clean and fresh and isn't overwhelming. Love it!
2,26-Feb-20,5,Keep the wick trimmed. Love Yankee candles. Have used them for years. They use the best oils resulting in fragrance to fill a large room and then some!
2,28-May-19,4,Candle French Country sidr Good fragrance but had issues keeping it lit as it burned down to last 1/4.
2,13-Dec-19,4,Nice if you like the smell....not for me The smell is ok but not something I would purchase again
2,5-Jan-19,5,Long lasting and great scents! Love the scent and how long these Yankee candles last! I'll keep buying them for these very reasons!

2,16-Feb-19,5,Lilac candle Purchased a few of these lilac candles as gifts. Smell great! Last long time. Good price.
2,2-May-20,1,Arrived damaged I ordered a candle because it‚Äôs a specific scent that‚Äôs hard to find. When it arrived it looked like it had melted and rehardened and now i can‚Äôt burn it. It still smells good but what a waste ‚ò?Ô?è
2,24-Oct-20,1,Candle was melted to one side of the jar. The entire Yankee Lavender Large Candle was melted to one side and inside the top.....melted was residue was on the outside of the box also.
2,17-Jun-20,5,Beautiful scent It really does smell like roses only better and stronger scent. Lasts a really long time.

2,2-Sep-20,1,Not a Yankee Candle! This candle came in a Yankee Candle box but it wasn't a Yankee Candle.  It's an Aromascape Lavender Vanilla.  It's scent is weak and it burns unevenly.
2,16-Jul-20,1,It looks as though the candle melted during shipping Poor product

2,19-Feb-17,5,"She loves it .. We love Yankee candles! This fragrance is usually available at our BB&B, but I didn't want to take a chance so ordered it online.  (It was a gift!). Maybe a little more expensive to do it this way but, in this case, worth it."
2,6-Nov-19,5,love love love MY FAVORITE YANKEE CANDLE!!
2,10-Mar-20,5,My daughter favorite candle Bought for my daughter
2,10-Jul-20,3,"Ordered two - one was shattered, one was perfect Love the smell, it's my favorite - that's why I ordered 2. Unfortunately, one of them was shattered & broken throughout the glass. Amazon issued a refund though - as a gift card. Which is odd because I paid with my credit card..."
2,12-Mar-20,5,Wonderful smell. Love is candle & smell. Use several in my house.
2,23-Dec-19,5,"Love Guys, it's Yankee... Duh it's good!"
2,29-Dec-17,5,"It really does smell like fresh cut roses! I bought this as a gift for my mother-in-law, smelled it - loved it and sent one to my own Mom! It really does smell like fresh cut roses! I would buy it for myself, if we burned candles."
2,3-Feb-18,5,Very Fragrant I purchased the large Gardenia jar candle.  It's very fragrant but not overpowering and clean burning.  Cap it with the lid to put it out and there's no smoking.
2,24-Dec-18,5,"Candle This was purchased as a gift.  It smells great.  If it burns like my balsam and cedar candle, it does great."
2,4-Sep-20,5,"Love this scent, a little hard to get. Well worth it! Favorite scent. Highly recommend."
2,20-Apr-18,5,Five Stars Absolutely beautiful fragrant
2,2-Jul-19,3,"A little soapy smelling, but otherwise a good product Smells more like soap than most yankee candle products. Not bad, and at least it smells clean, but there‚Äôs no convincing yourself that you‚Äôre in a garden of gardenias."
2,2-Jan-20,5,Yes buy this ! Can‚Äôt go wrong with Yankee
2,1-Mar-20,5,Smells soo good Love the smell yankee candles r the best
2,8-Dec-19,1,"Doesn‚Äôt  smell at all!!! I bought the candle because I have the car sent. The candle is beautiful, but just burns nothing!!! You get no smell out of it!!!"
2,17-Nov-20,5,Thumb up Smell very nice. I like it
2,14-Dec-19,5,Love this scent! Love this scent
2,8-Aug-18,3,"Very faint scent The scent is very pretty, however very light.  Probably best in a small room.  It took 8 hours before the scent showed up."
2,18-Jan-20,5,Smells wonderful Was given as a gift and it‚Äôs perfect
2,16-Jan-20,4,Sweet strong scent Good strong scent but a little too sweet for my taste. Reminds me of candy
2,5-Jan-20,5,Wonderful scent Love the scent!
2,12-Aug-20,5,Absolutely Perfection I absolutely love yankee candles. They last for a very long time and great for the price. They smell wonderful and the scent last. Lovely. ‚ù§Ô?è
2,24-Jun-20,1,Refund please It was broken
2,18-Nov-20,2,I didnt like the smell Feels like product is over priced. can buy same smell in dollar tree.
2,31-May-18,5,"Five Stars Our granddaughter's face lit up when she opened this and smelled her ""favorite candle."""
2,23-Apr-20,5,Perfect Product came professionally packaged and is exactly what I ordered!  Love it!
2,27-Nov-18,5,Year round candle This candle is great for anyone. It‚Äôs a nice subtle scent that can be used year round. I use it in my living room and it produces a noticeable scent but it isn‚Äôt overbearing.
2,14-Sep-20,5,Yankee candles Was delivered on time it said!
2,5-Jun-19,5,Amazing scent Perfect fragrance and so beautiful.  Ended up buying two.
2,16-Aug-17,5,Wonderful smell This has a very nice rose smell.  Nothing fake about it.
2,21-Dec-19,5,Nice candle good price Great scent
2,4-Oct-20,1,"Really disappointed in ""enchanted woods"" scent This scent was waaayyyy too strong. At the risk of sounding rude, this reminded me of an expired perfume. The peony is the only note I could smell. Not halloween or spooky smelling.Defintely returning"
2,19-Dec-18,5,Pretty strong throw Not all the on sale candles smell like anything but this one is wonderful and pure.  Get it.
2,9-Jul-20,1,Half of these candles arrive broken. Arrived shattered in box.
2,2-Aug-20,1,"Neva-haava Smeels like my new bride's underwear, who's 70 BTW"
2,25-Oct-16,5,"Love this candle Love this candle, this is my second time buying it because I love the smell so much. It has a very sweet smell, similar to candy or a jolly rancher but not overwhelming. The jar lasts me about 6 months and that is someone who usually has it lit everyday for about 4-5 hours each day. The candle came nicely bundled in bubble wrap and I didn't find any cracks like some other reviewers mentioned."
2,8-May-20,5,"Perfect Candle! Smell is great for any room, bathroom, living room."
2,17-Jul-20,2,"The candle itself is awesome, shipping is horrible This was such a wonderful smell, but I couldn't even fully open the box because the entire candle jar was shattered in delivery. There was not even any bubble wrap inside the box. So disappointed."
2,17-Apr-19,4,"Not overwhelming Not a very strong scent, I only noticed it when I was close to it.  I did enjoy it, just wish the aroma was more present."
2,5-Aug-17,4,"Excellent scent, long lasting! Burns slow and emits strong scent for large sized room. Follow directions for care on Yankee Candle jar. Amazon pricing for 22 oz is competitive from 3rd buyers but worth the occasional look. Big savings!"
2,15-Jun-11,5,"love it !  love it! love it! I was visiting my mother-in-law and wanted to buy her a gift.  There was a Yankee display and (not lying) this was the last candle I picked up.  Why?  Because it's pink!  Ha!  I fell in love with the smell though!  As a matter of fact, so has everyone else - no kidding.  there has not been one time, either at her house or mine, that when this candle is lit, a woman doesn't comment on how great it smells.  And they always ask what is it, as well as, write it down.  Never before have I had a candle that smelled so good.  Sadly, I have to tell them it is called ""Pink Sands"" (embarrassing!).This product will probably be discontinued once the word spreads."
2,24-Jun-20,5,Great Great
2,11-Nov-18,5,Worth it! Love the scent! I light it before bed every night. Lasts so long! Will buy again once it burns out.
2,27-Jul-19,4,Great Gift Not the best smelling...not the worse either.  Great gift!
2,25-Feb-19,5,"Yankee candle This candle smells amazing and it burns evenly, just remember to trim the wicks before lighting it each time"
2,3-Nov-20,5,Yankee Candle Wedding Day Scent Wonderful scent - hard product to find.  Glad this seller had it!
2,24-Jul-19,5,Nice lavender scent at an even nicer price. Nice lavender scent at an even nicer price.
2,22-Dec-19,5,Love Love it.
2,17-Jan-19,5,Very good smell Im using this with my candle warmer lamp. This smell so good for my bed room. Not too much strong not too much weak. This is perfect gift for anybody.
2,16-Apr-18,3,Soft Scent Not as much perfume in this candle as in Trapp candles.  Maybe would work better in a smaller room  Nice scent but you're barely aware of it.
2,10-Feb-20,5,Great value Smells fantastic
2,11-Feb-20,5,"Lovely scent These candles smelled so good, as soon as I opened the box I could sleep them! Highly recommend theses candles will be re ordering soon !"

2,4-Jun-17,5,Lilac Candle Daughter loves it.  Likes the jar and loves the smell.  Great service.
2,17-Jun-20,5,"Yankee Lavender/Vanilla Lavender/Vanilla is calming and does not have a strong, overpowering smell."
2,14-Mar-18,4,"Four Stars A bit of a subdued scent compared to other Yankee candles, but it's very pleasant."
2,14-Mar-20,4,Won't be sorry Love this candle !!
2,21-Aug-20,1,I am soooooooo sad I heard noises inside which was unusual since this is a candle...there should not be clinking noises. The candle was in an amazon box with two ‚Äúairplus‚Äù bags. Pretty disappointed as it was supposed to be a gift for someone.
2,26-Jul-20,2,Burns too fast We have been buying Yankee Candles for over 15 years and these candles burns way too quick. They do not last as long as the Yankee Candles bought from the Yankee Candle store
2,10-Jan-20,5,It‚Äôs awesome Smell
2,15-Dec-14,5,"Amazing Smell What really can a person say about the candle in its review? Some might agree that the scent is amazing and some might not like it. However, I do love the scent and it's lilac blossom scent. It is hard to find this scent in the stores most of them don‚Äôt this scent or its sold out."
2,20-Feb-20,5,I would buy it again I brought this for my mom for her birthday it is very light smell and very beautiful candle.
2,28-Jul-19,3,Not strong at all.  Use in a small room. Not strong at all. Nice scent. Use in a small room if you want to smell it.
2,20-Sep-20,1,Broken It was cracked this the second yankee candle I have purchased that was cracked
2,10-Oct-20,5,Smells so clean! Awesome clean scent! Great price for a Yankee Candle too!!!
2,7-Mar-19,4,Nice floral Nice perfume like fragrance. Not too powdery or strong. Just right.
2,9-Oct-20,5,Perfect! Really the best quality thing! Thank you!
2,6-Jun-18,5,"Soft, and pretty scent! Love this scent! Not overpowering... just soft, i purchased the large jar, small jar and two medium in the tumbler LOVE THEM!"
2,16-May-17,5,Mother's Day Gift Bought this as a mother's gift for my mother and she loved it! a great different option to flowers and the smell lasts much longer!
2,2-Jul-19,5,"Nice throw,  good price Good price, delivered fast. Candle has a nice scent."
2,20-Feb-19,1,Very Bad This candle is only good for holding a lit wick. It has zero smell. Thinking it was a Yankee Candle Product I thought it would have some benefit. Maybe if I lose my power I may have use for it.
2,14-Sep-20,5,Wonderful gift Love this!
2,27-Feb-19,5,"Great price, great scent The pink sands scent is my favorite. I love this candle and this is a great price for it!"
2,17-Jul-19,5,Love Will buy more of this scent for sure
2,29-Aug-19,5,"Does not disappoint. The best! If you find it in car fresheners, grab one!"
2,22-Oct-12,5,"Yankee's the best! The price is steeper than most candles but the product is worth the few extra bucks since it burns longer & the odor is consistently produced down to the last burn.This scent - well, ""to each his own"", but I happen to like it because it's not too ""fake"" smelling, like some candles that try to imitate the smell of roses or otherwise."
2,23-Jul-18,5,"It's Yankee Candle, what else is there to say? Bought it as a gift for my Stepmom. She loved the scent and the color was nice. Can't go wrong with a Yankee. :)"
2,12-Mar-20,1,Doesn't have a strong smell to it. The wax is not as strong as it used to be.
2,2-Jan-20,5,nice nice
2,26-Dec-19,5,Smells so good! This was the perfect gift. Packaging was great for keeping safe. Scent is incredible!
2,27-Jan-19,5,Beautiful scent for home Lovely scent
2,21-Oct-18,5,Beautiful scent Beautiful scent!!
2,31-Dec-19,5,"I liked this candle I gave this candle to someone as a birthday gift. I don‚Äôt know how long that they were able to have it for, but usually when I buy Yankee Candle products, they last a long time. The scent is nice and light. I‚Äôd recommend it to any lady."
2,27-Jun-20,5,Happy customer Bought as a father's day gift he is happy
2,23-Sep-20,5,great smell i love the smell very relaxing.
2,3-Jan-20,5,It‚Äôs as Advertised No comments
2,4-Apr-20,5,Very Good Very Good
2,16-Aug-18,3,Great candle but the wick will not light after a few uses. I love the smell of the candle but 3/4 of it is left and the candle wick won't light.  I am not sure why.
2,20-Jul-19,5,Best fragrance!! Yankee Candles are the best ones out there along with Salt City.  Price was awesome too.  Would buy more on here.
2,10-Sep-19,1,FAKE YANKEE CANDLE This is a fake Yankee Candle. I have been buying Yankee Candles for many years and I know them well. These are definitely NOT Yankee Candles. DO NOT BUY!!!
2,11-May-20,5,Great value!!! Yankee candle delivers! Good stuff & I don‚Äôt have to fumble from a store with it! Thanks Amazon
2,20-Oct-18,5,Good Good
2,20-Jul-16,4,"Looks outdated but smells great I was very hesitant to buy Yankee candles despite the fame. The main reason is the 90s looking packaging, which evokes mental associations with artificial, cheap, plasticky and chemical fragrance. I'm not of a New Age anti science type, and I understand everything contains chemicals, and what H2O means. I acknowledge that some greatest perfumes contain synthesized compounds, and they smell great. However, you know some candles with cheap artificial fragrance just give you headache and only make the space smell repulsive. Unfortunately, many of those have the look of this packaging, especially the dyed wax. Dyed wax is just so off-putting... But compared to the high end candles, this one is a great deal if you are aware of how big it is. So I set my ""bias"" aside and got it. Well, it actually smells great! Not a trace of offensive grocery store air freshener scent! Maybe it doesn't smell like real lavender, but that's expected. It's processed natural fragrance, you can't expect it to smell like the plant itself. But again it smells unmistakably lavender, very soothing. I guess I can bear with the look now. Actually some people might find this packaging nostalgic and authentic to the brand, I sincerely hope they would offer the same great scent in some more updated and modern packaging."
2,26-Sep-19,5,Great gift Bought for a gift they loved it
2,10-Jan-20,5,Love! You can‚Äôt go wrong with Yankee Candles ?ü§??üè?‚Äç‚ôÄÔ?è?ü•?
2,7-Aug-19,2,Dull scent Not happy... Scent wasn't strong at all.
2,27-Dec-19,5,Lovely scent Good cost
2,14-Jan-13,5,"Mother's Favorite I give this scent a 5 based on the fact that my 85 year old mother LOVES burning this candle. As soon as the one gets low, I order another one. The scent this candle gives off while burning does smell very much like old english roses not cosmetic or chemical like some other brands. As long as mom is happy, this is a regular purchase."
2,18-Mar-17,4,Send me candles please. if i was able to afford it i would burn these non stop everywhere i went. i really love the scent and the two wick version of this candle.
2,5-Jan-18,5,"Returning Customer This candle company is probably one of my top favorites to buy from. The quality, scent and size are perfect for the everyday candle lover. I was surprised at how professional the shipping for this came in but really thankful since it's a gift for a family member. Would love to buy again!"
2,1-Dec-19,5,Worth it Oh my gosh! This smells like fresh roses....perfect. Im in love!
2,8-Nov-17,5,"Heady parfume, long lasting burn Arrived solid, perfumed intact when lit. I buy all my Yanks from here, excellent quality. Watch for sale."
2,17-Jul-20,1,"Damaged Upon Arrival. TWICE. LOVE Yankee Candles, Lilac Blossoms is one of my favorites.  Unfortunately, both the original order and the replacement order arrived shattered.  Broken glass EVERYWHERE.  Packaging is horrible. Won't order via Amazon again."
2,17-Feb-20,5,Pink sands Smells great!
2,13-Aug-19,5,"Burns forever! Been lighting this puppy everyday for at least 2 weeks, still have 25 percent left. And I burn for hours a day!"
2,13-May-20,5,Thank you I love my candles and thank you sooo much for delivering it to my door instead of by the mail box which is right by the street that any one has access to. I hope that continues. Thanks again and I will be ordering more of these candles

2,26-Aug-20,1,Not the scent that most folks like This candle does not smell like it‚Äôs descriptors support. It actually stinks. But would like if you enjoy the scent of laundry detergent.
2,15-Jun-19,5,"Great scent, long lasting This is my favorite scent! This candle lasts a longtime. I always get a lot of compliments on the scent in my home. This works great for me in my kitchen since it‚Äôs the center of my home."

2,12-Dec-18,5,"Great value.. Great value for the money. Half the price of Hallmark, and laid on the front door step. Amozon is the BEST..."
2,12-Apr-16,5,"Nice throw! I'm not typically a floral girl (I prefer fruity fragrances), but this was on sale so I thought I would try it. It has a nice throw and fills the house with the smell of summer!  I will buy again."

2,11-Jan-20,5,Long lasting lovely scent Long lasting with a lovely scent.
2,26-May-20,5,"Wonderful rose scent. Great, safe, packaging. This candle smells great and fresh. A lot of rose scented things smell rotten but this doesn‚Äôt. Very long lasting."
2,20-Sep-20,3,Pleasant scent but it doesn't remove strong odors such as onions after cooking. I expected it to be more fragrant.
2,28-Jul-20,2,Disappointed Scent is not strong AT ALLBurns extremely fastCheaply produces wickNot worth the money
2,25-Jul-20,2,Great smell bad presentation The smell is amazing but when this candle arrived its was melted this way. Other candles that I had in the particular order were not affected besides this one. I'm not sure what to do with this haha.

2,18-Jul-20,1,"Great candle, broken items The lilac scent is amazing, and they last a long time, but have seriously dropped the ball in breaking our candles in delivery. Twice in a row broken ones sent. If they could be sent in one piece, they‚Äôd be great."
2,28-Apr-18,5,"Nice scent! Nice scent, clean with a little sweetness.  Not overpowering at all.  It lasts, too.  Have bought this scent twice."

2,11-Jul-19,5,"Favorite Scent Ever This is my favorite Yankee Candle scent. This size is great, it lasts a really long time; like, surprisingly long. I‚Äôve purchased so many of these, and I‚Äôll continue to do so, I love it!"

2,19-Dec-19,5,Great product I love the smell of lilacs and finding this candle for only $5 was a steal! And I love Yankee Candles.
2,2-Jul-11,5,"YANKEE Lilac Blossoms This candle is the best capture of geniune lilac fragrance that I have found. I LOVE it. One male co-worker thought it smelled like roses, but I think he just did not know his flower fragrances. Wonderful spring smell that fills a room; totally delightful."
2,27-Dec-19,5,Love Truly smells like jasmine.
2,31-Oct-19,5,Like  Blossom  Rocks Love the scent and will get  another one when this one runs out!  Jan  C

2,17-Sep-19,5,Cute Fragrance
2,6-Jun-18,5,Five Stars Long lasting candle
2,6-Feb-14,4,"Nice Scent This is a nice floral scent. The 7 oz tumblers won't last long at all. I usually buy this size to try out a scent, and if I like it I'll get the bigger sizes which are better value. I find that none of the Yankee Candle scents are that strong so don't count on them as room freshners."
2,10-Jul-20,1,Melted candles. I received my order and 3 of the candles had melted and the wicks were embedded in them.  Useless.
2,11-May-20,1,"Glass jar was shattered! The glass jar my candle was in was shattered! The box wasn‚Äôt damaged but the candle sure was! This is my first bad review from an order but when I say the glass was shattered, I mean in a million pieces!"

2,30-Oct-12,5,"You really DO get what you pay for! As a bachelor, I decided it was incumbent upon me to find some nice candles.  As I began my online search (far be it from me to drive to a MALL!) I found one particular brand to be consistently higher priced than the bulk of the others.  As 'Yankee Candle' is a brand name I had heard mentioned by my sisters and daughter-in-law, I finally made the supreme sacrifice of spending more than a dollar for candles. Now I feel like an educated, extremely knowledgeable consumer, with above-average intelligence. Not true, but anyone visiting my home THINKS I'm smarter than the average guy!What a great smell! If you buy this candle, you won't be sorry!"

2,3-Jan-20,5,"Pretty Not much fragrance, but I would buy it again."
2,22-Jan-13,5,"I'd buy it again in a heart beat I purchased this fragrance based on the recommendations as I was having it shipped to Australia.

2,13-Feb-17,5,Awesome scent This candle fills the room with a wonderful Jasmine scent. All to many scented candles have no scent unless you are standing right next to it.
2,4-Mar-14,5,"Lavendar Candles I love to burn lavendar candles.  They have the freshest, cleanest smell.i have a very difficult time finding pure lavendar .  Yankee seems to think it needs to be combined with vanilla or lemon or some other scent.  I think all that does is ruin the true essence of lavendar! Vanilla was the first scent that ever came out in candles, and i burned so many vanilla candles, that i cannot stand the smell of vanilla today!"
2,5-Aug-17,5,"Wonder smell. This candle really does smell like roses, really good."
2,30-Apr-20,1,My candle arrived completely smashed and unusable I love this scent but the candle itself arrived shattered. The box literally had glass shards falling out of it before i even opened it up.

2,3-Nov-18,5,Great scent Awesome scent for the summer!
2,21-May-20,5,Smells smelly like a smelly smell Package came but the delivery just threw the package and could have broken the candle.
2,2-May-08,4,"beachwalker I am very happy with the product and the short time it took to receive it.The jar, unforunately, broke during shipping but not a fault of the seller. The item was well packaged so I suspect poor handling by USPostal Service.  In any case, seller sent compimentary matching small jar candles in same fragrance as good will gesture.  I would buy from this seller again."
2,1-Dec-18,2,"Doesn‚Äôt smell strong enough like others Yankees As others warned, this version of the candle just doesn‚Äôt smell as strong as you would expect. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs old or a fake or what, but I‚Äôve seen other lavender Yankee candles and this one is a fraction of the smell."
2,11-Mar-18,1,"Not A New Candle!!! Smelled fine, but the one I received had clearly already been burned a few times. Did not realize I was buying a ""used"" candle!"

2,29-Jul-15,5,Great product and great price awesome fragrance and extra benefit of saving dollars over store purchase.  I do not know if this price will continue (under $14) but this gave me the chance to try Yankee Candle in a jar for future needs.
2,1-Jul-14,5,"Convenient, lovely smell I've had these candles before in the ""glass mug"" but find the plain  jar less smoky and easier to deal with. The candle has a pleasant lilac smell, a bit strong (as lilacs often are) but not too artificial (as candles often are)./"

2,24-Jun-14,5,"Wonderful fragrance. My room has high ceilings and is large.  It is difficult to get a candle with  enough throw to enjoy it.  The 2 wick tumblers are the answer for me.This fragrance is relaxing, flowery and not overwhelming at all."
2,18-Apr-18,3,Not my fave! The smell wasn't very strong or powerful.  :(  But arrived safe!
2,15-Dec-19,3,Subtle but good value The candle was a great value but the scent was very subtle.

2,28-Mar-12,5,"Pretty Scent One of my favorite scents!!  Lilacs are so beautiful and fragrant and this candle captures their smell just perfectly!  It's worth the price...enjoy it!  As to how it was shipped, it was wrapped securely in bubble wrap along with the air pouches."

2,16-Dec-19,5,Cane broken Cane broken
2,7-Mar-14,1,"SMELLS GREAT BUT ARRIVED SHATTERED I was really upset that such an expensive item was packaged in bubble wrap only and not in its own small box.  I ordered another candle of the same size and a smaller item in the same order.  The other candle- Jasmine by Yankee also was bubble wrapped but packed in an individual box so it was in perfect condition.  My sister salvaged the candle but I was nerve wracked and had shards of glass pieces and splinters all over my floor.  It was very disappointing.  Now whenever I order candles I guess I have to order each one individually or risk getting one that's broken.  Amazon usually packages well.  I was shocked.  Now I have to look at this broken candle every day, which was supposed to look beautiful and peaceful."
2,14-Oct-19,5,Loveee yankee candles!! Long lasting candle! Great price. Great smell. Safely packaged and fast shipping !
2,22-Jun-20,5,"True fragrance It is like having a bouquet of roses in the room. Wonderful product, I buy whenever I can."
2,24-Jan-19,5,Would purchase again Giving as a gift. Very pleased
2,23-Jun-13,4,"Yankee Candle - Fresh Cut Roses This is my first Yankee Candle so I wasn't sure what to expect. The fragrance is rather sweet compared to the 3 doz roses I have in my yard. The candle is long lasting, so that's a plus. I will probably try another scent if I order another sometime."

2,1-Mar-18,3,Faint smell If you like a very faint smell then this candle is for you.  I will not buy this scent again as I like a stronger fragrance like Wedding Day.
2,6-Feb-20,5,"Best of the best !! Yankee candles !! Its the way to go ! Best of the best !! Yankee candles are the best , without a doubt"
2,29-Dec-19,5,Great gift idea! Excellent buy!  Love Yankee. Candles but very often they are overpriced.  This makes gifting easy.
2,2-Feb-16,1,Absolutely no scent. I ordered three Yankee candles and ... Absolutely no scent. I ordered three Yankee candles and as I lit and burned all three there was absolutely no scent. I even asked a friend that came by and she agreed. I attribute it to maybe old candles?

2,25-Apr-19,1,Bad This is the most defective candle I have ever bought. I have always been a fan of yankee until now. I cant keep the candle lit. It sizzles like there is water in it
2,7-May-20,1,Bait and switch In the description they stated that it was a six pack. I only received 1. I want the other 5.
2,6-Oct-20,1,Damaged Opened the box to use it today and it was completely messed up. I can‚Äôt even get to the wick. It‚Äôs useless.
2,8-May-18,3,"This was on sale so the price was great but it doesn‚Äôt smell as much as higher-end candles This was on sale so the price was great but it doesn‚Äôt smell as much as higher-end candles. If purchased at full price, it would not have been worth it."
2,11-Dec-18,5,Awesome Exactly the same as if I were to purchase it from Yankee Candle.
2,29-Dec-18,1,It smelled like a traditional wax candle without the scent. I was very very disappointed because it smelled like a cheap wax candle.  I‚Äôve used Yankee Candles for years and typically have to blow them out after a half hour or so because they get too strong.  I‚Äôm certain it was defective and turned out to be a bad gift idea.
2,18-May-19,5,Perfect Smells soooo good!

2,29-Nov-17,1,Lots of broken glass When I got my candle someone had put the lid on incorrectly and it was shattered when I opened it. When I say incorrectly I mean that the top glass part of the lid was jammed into the glass instead of the softer plastic that fits snuggly. This is the first time I‚Äôve had a bad experience with an amazon delivery.
2,28-Dec-17,5,"This is so awesome!! I'm definitely buying more This is so awesome!! I'm definitely buying more!! I have the Yankee Jasmine and gardenia candle jars, but this is one of their best! Highly recommend it!!"

2,6-Dec-14,1,"Not a good smell I purchased 2 Wedding Day Yankee Candles and they do not smell at all like the ones I have purchased from Yankee.I have always loved the scent of the Wedding Day candle and know it very well. These smelled like an odd vanilla mixed with something I can not place. Since Yankee Candle put this scent in their treasure chest, so its only available at certain times. I'm assuming these have just been sitting around for a long time. I will say the products did arrive quickly and well packaged."

No headache, I have burn candles that would bring on a migraine. Mine came wrapped so that the glass around the candle couldn't break. Pick up your favorite scent today. Update: August 9th, 2016 I purchased this the third candle and this one isn't lilac blossom. They must have put the wrong label on this lilac colored candle. It has a sweet smell but it isn't what I wanted. Oh well I already started burning it. I still love Yankee candles. I'm just not crazy about the scent I received."

2,5-May-13,4,"Not bad! I rely on user reviews when ordering an new product, so I thought I would throw my opinion into the mix.  When I opened the candle, there was a very strong sweet smell.  Burning, however, the strong scent is muted and very pleasant.  I agree with another reviewer:  this candle definitely reminds me of jolly rancher candy.  This is going to be a ""fun"" scent!In addition, Amazon's packaging of this item was excellent -- there was no way this candle was going to get broken in transit!"

I have several flower scents (gardenia, and lavender also) in my bedroom and it smells like a flower garden.Additionally, unintentionally, but not unwanted, in the cooler, or colder I should say, three pairs of the large jar candles can warm up a bedroom if it is not enormous. Ours is medium sized, so the warmth is palpable. The lighting is also sublime."

2,27-Feb-17,1,I wasn't satisfied with this order I wasn't satisfied with this order.  I can't smell the fragrance at all which is highly unusual for a Yankee Candle.  It makes me wonder if this is genuine or not.
2,2-Jan-15,5,"I love yankee candles and buy them regularly I love yankee candles and buy them regularly, with the lavender being my favorite. This last time I ordered one it was delivered to me shattered. I filed a claim and asked for a replacement, and within a week a new one arrived at my door in perfect condition. Thank you!"
2,2-May-16,1,"I did not feel comfortable returning broken glass Arrived broken. I reported it, and was asked to return it. I did not feel comfortable returning broken glass. So i was not reimbursed, but i love these candles, so i cant threaten that i wont buy more candles at price point. You all asked for the review, but if it happens again i will be calling."

Been buying these for 20 years, where did the quality control go? I guess YC has decided that their profit margin is more important than their loyal customer base. Caveat emptor!"

2,7-Sep-18,1,"Deeply Disappointed! I am a avid user of Yankee Candles and I have never been disappointed with a fragrance until I bought this Lilac fragrance. I have had many before that actually smelled like Lilacs, but this smells awful!  It is definitely not the sweet and lovely fragrance of Lilacs. I am so disappointed and will probably chuck it in the garbage."
2,8-May-17,3,"Not into the smell at all. I love Yankee candles this smells like soap to me. I thought I would go with more of the spring smells.  I adore the warmer smells.  Apple pie, Carmel etc. This was a test drive for me. If you like the smell of soap this is for you."
2,28-Feb-16,5,Five Stars Long lasting smell!

2,2-Aug-15,5,Five Stars Great scented candle
2,12-Sep-16,1,One Star Arrived broken. I didn't want to ship glass back.
2,11-Oct-16,5,"Five Stars I love the candle but when it arrived the jar was broke into many pieces,"
2,29-Sep-13,2,GLASS SHATTERED Yankee Candles are amazing but DO NOT order from here!!The packaging is not sturdy enough and it will not come in one piece.I'm so upset I paid this much and I cant even put the cap on the candle because the sides are broken into pieces. I tried to glue it the best I could but the wax will drip down once it gets to the level where it was shattered. SOO disappointed...I advise you to go to the actual store or order it from there website.
2,27-Jan-14,1,Disappointed with Product I chose this rating because I was disappointed with the aroma emitted.  You could barely smell the lavender and for$29.99 it was so overpriced
2,21-Aug-17,5,Five Stars Absolutely love the smell!
2,6-Sep-16,3,Three Stars Came broken.
2,24-Dec-15,1,"Fake! I just purchased a lavender ""Yankee Candle"" and it's CLEARLY not real. Be weary of paying $25 for a fake candle :("
2,13-Apr-16,4,Four Stars as described.
2,14-Apr-12,5,"EXCELLENT I love my candle, and use it all the time when I'm studying.  It is such a relaxing scent, and have already suggested it to friends."

2,28-Apr-14,5,Love the aroma Recommend for anyone that likes the smell of lilacs.Yankee Candles are the best scented candles I haveever used.
2,4-Dec-16,1,"Don't buy this product online Yes this was the candle I wanted, the size, scent and price were great. BUT I can't enjoy it because it was delivered to me completely broken. This was supposed to be a gift for my mother and I wanted to surprise her with this scent and now just to get my money back I have to ship this broken glass back?"
2,4-Dec-16,5,"Love the color Love this scent , scent stay in the room"
2,26-Apr-16,2,"Do you like the smell of Jasmine Green tea? Well then this isn't for you! I like the physical design of the candle, looks really high quality. Although it smells nothing like jasmine in my opinion. I don't know why I was expecting something like Jasmine Green tea. This smells more like Clorox than Jasmine. I was seriously so sad. I even ordered some extra stuff off amazon to get same day shipping. Turns out it was a garbage scent."
2,20-Oct-15,5,"smell great, love Slow burn, smell great, love it"
2,22-Jan-15,5,Not overpowering The relaxing smell sets the mood in an average sized room and is not overwhelming.
2,21-Aug-14,5,Five Stars Subtle but wonderful.  Very satisfied.
2,15-Apr-15,5,"Delivery was fast and love my candle! Candle smells great, had my neighbor compliment my apt. Fresh cut roses smells like a clean garden."
2,24-Aug-16,5,Five Stars Smells sooo good!
2,24-Nov-17,2,"Not much of lilac. Yankee candles I have purchased in the past, I could smell the scent as soon as I open the box.But this one' scent is so faint, I have to stick my nose deep into the jar to get some whiff of lilac.Also there are many white spots on top of the candle which looks like fungus. Close examination tells they are not fungus, and I don't know what they are.Maybe this candle has been sitting in a warehouse for many years, hence the lack of scent and the weird white things on top."
2,2-Jul-15,1,One Star no smell at all
2,25-May-15,5,"Five Stars Love, love, love Yankee Candle, I want more & more, and more!"
2,16-Jul-17,1,"WHERE'S THE SMELL OF ROSES? I agree with Amazon Customer on June 11th.  There is no smell of roses unless you get within a foot.  And then it is barely noticeable.  I have never bought Yankee Candles, and probably won't again.  Very disappointing"
2,29-May-16,1,One Star Product was shattered upon arrival.
2,8-Jul-15,3,"Lavender-ish I'm a lavender purist so this is just ""ok"".  Smells lavender-y -- not like pure lavender essential oil.  Flowery as opposed to herby.  Sweet.  Not my preference but it'll do."
2,14-May-16,2,Two Stars I got my candle and it was broke
2,15-May-14,5,"Amazing Candle! I love my new candle, great scent and I appreciate the free gift!! thank you, will be a return customer for sure"
2,12-Apr-14,1,"Packaging terrible, jar broke, could not use. Jar broke, the packaging was not good. Was not able to use the candle . Had to throw it away."
2,5-Dec-15,1,Poor packaging. Candle came broken.
2,27-Apr-13,5,"Lilac Blossoms They wern't broken this time, securing the covers on did the trick.The scent is great.  Thank You,  Mary A. Schnopp"
2,27-Jul-17,1,Disappointed! Wax melted side way inside of the glass container. Now the wick is completely covered. What kind of a nonsense is this?!
2,19-Jan-16,4,Four Stars A+
2,30-May-12,3,"katherine.minor I thought that the smell would be stronger. Still a good candle, but not a 'housewarmer' as it is called."
2,20-Feb-15,5,Five Stars came perfect and packaging was awesome. happy
2,15-Mar-14,5,"very cute gift bought this for my sister to burn on her wedding day.  great price, shipped quickly, love it.  can't wait for the big day!"

2,24-Jul-16,5,"This jar smells like lavender and it will last quite a long time This jar smells like lavender and it will last quite a long time. It is exactly what i was looking for. The scent isn't too strong or over powering, just right."
2,22-Jan-14,5,Bought it as a gift and she loved it. My girlfriend told me a while back she liked this type of candle so I ordered this one and she loves it.
2,10-Dec-16,5,"Best Yankee Candle I love the longevity and quality of Yankee Candles. I particularly like Pink Sands and buy as much of the products offered in that scent as I can. It is strong enough to smell, but otherwise a soft and pretty fragrance for the home. It is not artificial smelling."
2,29-Jan-18,5,"it also smells very nice As long as you dump out the watery wax after each use it burns perfectly until you reach 1/2,the limit when you should discard it,it also smells very nice"
2,4-Sep-14,5,Five Stars Love it
2,5-May-14,1,"Arrived broken My candle was wrapped in one layer of bubble wrap, and in a box with a couple other items with room to move around.  The glass is all shattered inside the bubble wrap and now I have to return it.  Big disappointment."
2,19-Jan-15,4,Four Stars good!
2,4-Jun-15,5,"Five Stars Beautiful scent, LOVE"
2,11-Dec-09,5,"Very pleased I purchased this item for a gift, and I have never seen or received a product so well packaged. I was also notified by e-mail as to when the candle was shipped.  I would not hesitate to buy again from crazycandles. They are great sellers."
2,9-Aug-17,2,"Love Yankee candles Love Yankee candles, but very disappointed in this one.  Smells great in the jar, but gives off almost NO scent when burning."
2,23-Sep-14,5,Five Stars Good
2,3-Jan-15,5,Five Stars Great
2,30-Oct-17,1,I didnt smell anything and they pooped eveytime I tried ... I didnt smell anything and they pooped eveytime I tried to light them. I do not belive that these candles are authentic.
2,29-Dec-14,3,Three Stars Love Yankee candles but they have a lot of toxic fumes and smoke like crazy.
2,3-Apr-16,1,Do not buy! Omg I love these candles but this is the worst fragrance. It gave me such a blinding head ache.
2,21-Jan-18,5,... an incredible fragrance just sitting there and when lit perfect. Yankee Candles have an incredible fragrance just sitting thereand when lit perfect.

2,8-Sep-16,1,One Star Came melted. Had to slow heat in water to save it

2,11-Jan-18,5,Five Stars Loved loved loved will order again
2,13-Jul-17,5,Five Stars great candles
2,8-Jun-12,1,Melted Candle was packaged well but the wax had melted and the wick is useless. Disappointing to pay that much for a candle and not be able to burn it. I do have a candle warmer so I can enjoy the fragrance but not the ambience of the candle flame.
2,26-Aug-17,5,Five Stars Love Yankee Candles.
2,26-Jul-16,5,Five Stars good
2,9-Jun-15,2,"Was very disappointed, the candle didn't burn all the way down ... Was very disappointed, the candle didn't burn all the way down like most of my Yankee candles do. next time I'll buy it from the actual company instead of Amazon"
2,24-Aug-17,5,"Glad I took a risk Ordered as gift for a friend. I decided to order the most rated candle, because i had no idea what any of the scents smelled like. Great choice. Smells sweet but not over powering."
2,4-Oct-16,2,Two Stars Too much lilac
2,27-Nov-15,1,"BAD PRODUCT. DO NOT BUY THIS ! This one has already broken ,and can't use !!! Waste the money !!!"
2,8-Nov-17,5,For the girlfriend I bought this for my girlfriend for her birthday and she liked it a lot! So yeah I got a girlfriend NBD!
2,15-Aug-18,1,"No scent This candle has no scent at all.  It has voids in the jar, which is making me think it might not be a Yankee Candle at all."
2,14-Jan-17,2,Pink Sands Box was labeled correctly but once opened it was French vanilla.  It was a Christmas gift.
2,25-Feb-14,2,"Black smog When I had used it for couple of hours, I found a black smog from it. OMGThere are a lot of other candles which are cheaper and better in qualities."
2,18-Jan-18,1,One Star Not the same scent as the one I bought directly from Yankee candle last year.
2,5-Nov-12,1,"Unusable upon arrival I ordered two.  Both arrived having clearly been stored on their side in a warm environment.  Wax filled the glass jar lid, thus the wick was no where to be seen.I sent a kind note to Yankee Candle advising them of their issue.  Their response was totally unhelpful and without empathy.On principle, I will not purchase another product from this company."
2,14-Sep-15,1,And it isn't in a good way. I can definitely smell the musk This candle is so strong and overpowering. And it isn't in a good way. I can definitely smell the musk. I would not recommend this candle to ANYONE.
2,5-Apr-14,1,"Broken when received. The candle came to me sounding like a maraca.  There was way too much room in the box and the protective wrapping did not work, so the glass broke.  A rare fail for Amazon, and I've been a good customer for quite a while."
2,17-Sep-13,1,Candle Arrived shattered all over the box!! Would be more costly to send it back and don't want to chance replacing it for getting another one that is broken. Will not order again.
2,3-Feb-14,4,Good Generally in satisfied with the quality and scent of Yankee Candles. I do find that these candles will not give you an intense fragrance for a room.
2,19-Jan-14,5,Woo I love Yankee candles! They smell delightful. Very good option for gift giving for the holidays. Yep yep yep yep.
2,30-May-15,1,One Star It's smells stale and like old musty perfume.
2,6-Jul-15,2,I'll never buy these candles again. I've decided that these candles are ridiculously priced and don't even smell very much. I did NOT receive the pictured candle. I received one with a silver flat top and two wicks. Ridiculous Pricing Point.
2,22-Dec-16,2,"smells good but it came Its big,smells good but it came broken"
2,13-Aug-17,5,Five Stars Smells great
2,25-Feb-18,1,The candle smell was great but it came shattered and I can't figure out ... The candle smell was great but it came shattered and I can't figure out how to tell anyone that.

2,1-Jun-15,2,Arrived Broken! The candle was great - but it arrived to me broken with glass everywhere!
2,5-Oct-14,2,"Smells like a hospital Smells like a hospital, or cleaning products. Not gardenia-y at all. Very disappointing. Only time I've been disappointed by a Yankee candle in my life."
2,19-Mar-18,1,Product/glass arrived broken. There was no fragile sign on ... Product/glass  arrived broken. There was no fragile sign on box.
2,9-Jun-15,1,One Star The candle was shattered when I received it.
2,11-Dec-12,1,"Arrived broken Candle was the right one, but the jar was broken.  They need to do a much better job packaging them, and use tape to hold the plastic around the product."
2,2-Mar-15,2,"Smelled better in the beginning Good Quality candle, but I do not like the smell"
2,10-Jun-17,5,Five Stars ?üëç?üèª
2,29-Jul-15,1,"Disappointed Candle came with decorative sticker all messed up. Looked like it had been stuck, peeled off and reapplied. Also candle must have melted in delivery and was not even and looks like it was used. Wanted to give it with a wedding gift and it won't be possible to do so."
2,10-Sep-12,5,great Be detailed and specific. What would you have wanted to know before you purchased the product?Not too short and not too long. Aim for between 75 and 300 words.
2,22-Jun-15,1,One Star Was broken when it arrived!
2,20-Sep-14,1,One Star Love this scent!  Probably my favorite.
2,2-Mar-18,5,"Very pleasant scent, well packaged for shipping I really enjoy the special atmosphere that burning candles create, and so my family goes through a lot of them.  In trying different brands, we've found that Yankee Candles can be counted on for good burn time and consistency--it's so frustrating to have a candle that's only half burned but for whatever reason the wicks suddenly refuse to stay lit. It's also frustrating to have a candle that smells nice up close out of the box, but the smell is faint or nonexistent with burning.  These things don't happen with the Yankee Candle brand.This particular candle is their large jar size, with an estimated 110-150 hours burning time. This is the first Yankee Candle I've ordered online, as opposed to buying from a store, and I will say that I was highly impressed with the packaging.  There was a separate Yankee Candle cardboard shipping box placed inside an amazon box, and the candle itself was nestled securely in a molded/corrugated paper/cardboard device...I'm doing a terrible job describing it, so see the attached photo.  In sum, there's virtually no chance of breakage or damage to the glass container while shipping.I was curious to try this candle because it is a new scent for the Yankee Candle line, called ""A calm and quiet place,"" an intriguing and appealing name if I ever heard.  The product description calls it a ""meditative fragrance,"" built of ""gentle jasmine, a whisper of patchouli, and warm amber musk.""  Many of our favorite candles have been heavily patchouli-centric, so I was eager to try this new scent.  The verdict?  I liked it, and my husband liked it, a lot.  I'm not sure I detected the jasmine--both my husband and I felt that ""vanilla"" predominated, even though vanilla is not listed as one of the prime ingredients.  There was indeed a slight hint (but not overly strong presence) of patchouli, and the ""warm amber musk"" was an apt description.  Buying a scented product on the basis of verbal descriptions over the internet is always a risky prospect, but I can vouch that the ""calm and quiet place"" scent is not overpowering and is very pleasant, and if you like the sounds of vanilla/patchouli/warm musk, I think you would like this candle.  You'll find cheaper candles at your local drugstore, but I have found that with candles there's a real benefit to paying more for a quality brand.  I'm happy to recommend this candle highly."
2,10-Mar-18,4,"Pleasing, soft new fragrance This is a new fragrance from Yankee Candle's Spring line. I found the fragrance soft and pleasing, but not one of my favorites. For some reason it reminded me of a baby's room (in a good way). I have dozens of Yankee Candles and they remain my favorite brand.For your reference this is the detailed description of the fragrance from the Yankee Candle website:A centered fragrance‚Äîbalanced with gentle jasmine, a whisper of patchouli, and warm amber musk.Fragrance Notes:Mandarin LeafJasmine, CedarwoodPatchouli, Sandalwood, Amber MuskTop note is the initial impression of the fragrance, middle note is the main body of the scent and base is its final impression."
2,5-Jun-18,5,"Creme-de-la-Creme of Candles Yankee Candle sets the bar exceptionally high for other candle makers.  They smell natural, lacking the abrasive chemical aromatic tones from many chandlers.  ""Sweet Nothings"" is no exception.  The scent wizards at Yankee Candle have somehow distilled the essence of calm and put it in wax.  This candle is pleasant without being overpowering, adding a nice accent to the room without screaming for your attention.  In short, it lives up to its name.I would be surprised if it actually lasts 100+ hours of burn time.  I would estimate we've had it burning for 20-30 hours cumulatively and it appears almost half gone.  It's still a good value."
2,10-Mar-18,5,"Beautiful aromatic tones of fruit and flora, high quality craftsmanship The Yankee Candle Sun-Drenched Apricot Rose Candle has been a joy to have in our home.  I must admit that over the years I have steered towards the cheapest candles I could find - we burn through quite a few.  But there is nothing quite like the quality of a Yankee Candle, and while more expensive than other brands, it has exceptional value.This item arrived packaged in an amazon box, and a Yankee box inside.  There were protective shells inside the Yankee box that would ensure that the force from a hard drop would be distributed throughout the protective shell, not the glass.  Well done.There was a ""NEW"" collar around the glass neck of the jar that needed to be removed.  While perforated, I still required a knife to cut this excess packaging away.  Sharp knife, awkward angle.  I'd have rather not had to do this but no big deal.The scent of the Sun-Drenched Apricot Rose is very clean and light.  It's fruity, and creates an aromatic ambiance in the room.  It is very pleasant and calming.  Even when unlit, the aroma is beautiful and powerful.  When lit, the scent shifts slightly into a more floral presence.  We love it.This candle has staying power also.  It will burn for many long hours and can be enjoyed for many days under heavy use.  The mottled wax used in this candle is of a higher quality than the less expensive candles to which I had grown accustomed.  The wick has a strong consistent burn, but if burned while exposed to a draft you may need to do a bit of wick maintenance every so often - keep the length at 1/8"" for best results.  When there is 1/2"" of wax left in the jar, it is time to dispose of the candle.Highly recommended!"
2,21-Mar-18,5,"A Calm And Quiet Place I've been a fan of Yankee Candle for quite awhile but I've never heard of this new fragrance. This is a new one. It has a very subtle pleasant smell to it. One person that smelled it thought it smelled like the seashore to them. I think it smells like a baby or something baby related with a touch of powder to it. It has a slightly nostalgic yet familiar smell. I also smell sandalwood in it. Has a clean smell to it as well. Like a softer version of clean cotton. The smell reminds me of a baby, like another reviewer said. It's hard to explain that, but it does, it also reminds me of a crisp ocean breeze or the faint smell of the seashore. Usually, with a Yankee candle you get one straight scent coming to you, but with ones like this it's mixed scents, you can decide for yourself what it smells like, either way, if you like a light pleasing fragrance, you'll like this."
2,24-May-18,5,"Pleasant without being overpowering Yankee Candle has always been the ""creme de la creme"" when it comes to candle makers.  They smell natural, lacking the abrasive chemical olifactory tones from many chandlers.  ""A Calm & Quiet Place"" is no exception.  Maybe it's the power of the label's suggestion, but I feel like this candle is perfectly named.  The scent wizards at Yankee Candle have somehow distilled the essence of calm and put it in wax.  This candle is pleasant without being overpowering, adding a nice accent to the room without screaming for your attention.  In short, it lives up to its name.I would be surprised if it actually lasts 100+ hours of burn time.  I would estimate we've had it burning for 20-30 hours cumulatively and it appears almost half gone.  It's still a good value."
2,8-May-19,5,"Favorite wax melt, hands down. I discovered this scent a few years ago, and I‚Äôve been obsessed with it ever since. I rely heavily on scents and fragrances, and love how they can immediately bring back vivid memories, and transport you to another place. The top note is a light, sweet melon, with a slight citrusy scent. It makes me think of Honeydew and Oranges. The heart is a soft, exotic floral that reminds me of the heady, intoxicating fragrance of the tiare flower. The base is a warm, slightly spicy, musky vanilla. For me, as the scents meld together, it reminds me of the watery, green scent I love so much. It truly does transport you to a secluded beach, the waves lapping at your feet, on an exotic island far away. They sell out quickly at my local supermarket so I always make sure to buy whatever they have in stock so I never run out. The wax tarts are a good size, with at least 24 hours of fragrance with the wax burner never being turned off. It‚Äôs a strong scent, enough to fill up a room, but soft enough to not be overpowering. If you love the ocean, you‚Äôll love this."
2,2-May-20,5,"Long lasting, gentle presence, not cheap smelling I didn‚Äôt realize yankee candles could be so top quality with the affordable price of the large jars! I‚Äôm a candle feign.. hands down the white gardenia is the bomb dot com! It lasts forever!!! It‚Äôs not overpowering, not sweet (ew), it‚Äôs gentle and makes my space feel refreshed. I got the lavender vanilla too and that one is a little too sweet for me.. if you like vanillas and such, youde enjoy it... also not overwhelming but def present. I just ordered lilac blossoms and sunshine something based off the reviews I read. Didn‚Äôt want the pink sands since I saw it smells like a 16 year old girls room. Totally recommend these, trust!"
2,10-Mar-18,5,"Great scent with just a hint of rose I LOVE Yankee Candles and have been buying them for years.The sun drenched apricot rose is a nice soft spring time scent.  Just a touch of a rose scent to make your whole room smell wonderful.The large candles last such a long time.  So well worth the price.  Better yet, they have sales ALL the time that makes these even more affordable.I've had my neighbor tell me that when I have my doors and windows open, she can smell the scents all the way out on the street when she's walking her dog.  (I have candles burning in almost all my rooms)Right now I have the large candles, (different scents for the different seasons), and I have a large bag of tarts (also different scents for different seasons).  Eventually I will try out the plug ins.All the scents of these candles compliment each other.  So I can have different scents burning in different rooms and not have any of them clash with each other.For my birthday and for Christmas, I always ask for yankee candle gift cards.  And pictured are what I buy, to stock up for the year.These candles are a staple in our home."
2,31-May-16,2,"Line-Dried Cotton Votive It's not that I didn't like this scent, I couldn't keep this Votive's wick lit.For me, this scent is too perfumey. Strongest laundry detergent scented candle I‚Äôve tried so far and for my small house it was a little too strong; and the house was open today. Scent reminds me of a lemony laundry detergent, without any added softener.Scent has a great throw, as I could smell it 3 feet away within 2 minutes and throughout my entire house within 15 minutes. I wish all their candles had this great of a throw.The wick on this candle was terrible, and kept extinguishing itself. I relit the wick FOUR different times the first 2 hours it burned. I finally put it on my¬†  , and once the wax was melted, I relit the wick and it did stay burning. If it had had a hotter/thicker wick, I‚Äôm sure I wouldn‚Äôt have had this problem.This scent did bother my allergies a little, but not enough to not burn it."
2,9-Oct-20,5,Smells Just Like Our Wedding Day! My husband bought this candle as a surprise anniversary gift and it was perfect. I don't know how Yankee Candles do it but the smell of this candle brought me back to our wedding day like it had just happened 5 minutes ago.The scent is slightly floral with hints of sweet musk and earthy notes of sandalwood. The candle is also not strong ‚Äî the scent will not overpower the room but instead it just leaves a subtle hint of something special in the air. I like candles like that because they make the house smell great but in a way that would make a guest think your home just naturally smells that way. I love it!
2,21-Nov-20,4,"Smells like a rose plant I expected this to smell like a rose scented perfume or like a Catholic church (if you know, you know). It actually smells like a literal rose plant. The name says it all ""fresh cut roses"". So if you really really like the smell of the actual plant, you will like this candle.Apart from me not liking the scent, it also made me sneeze a lot! I had to blow it out midday. I will just gift it to someone. I don't want it. Good thing I bought it on prime day."
2,6-Mar-18,3,"Too strong for me, but good quality Yankee Candle makes quality (albeit pricey) candles that last for months if you use them as infrequently as I do. This new scent, ""Wildflower Blooms,"" is very floral and just a bit too overwhelming for my olfactory tastes. If strong florals affect your allergies then avoid. However, if you like flowery, perfume-like scents then this candle is a great option. It's strong enough to infuse an entire floor so you'll get plenty of use out of the large size."
2,27-Mar-18,5,"Strong Fragrance Overcomes Burning Wick Easily With scented candles I want specific things. Easy to light and a wick that doesn't blossom or smoke. I want a good scent before it is lit and I need it to put out the same fragrance after it is lit. This Sweet Nothings version of Yankee Candle in their large jar meets all of my criteria for an excellent scented candle.The scent reminded me of sweet tarts, the sugar little candies that I'm sure many of you reading this review are familiar with. After I lit it, the scent was immediately noticeable and it built up to fill the kitchen, the dining room, and the living room areas of a 2000+ square foot home. Unfortunately one of my family members really hates sweet tarts so I had to stop burning it about half an hour before he got home."
2,18-Mar-18,4,"Sweeter than expected I had to go look up the top note on this scent because it was very strong and sweet for me and didn't smell like the floral sweetness of jasmine. It turned out to be mandarin leaf.It's lightly sweet and the patchouli is a very, very light bottom note. I had to work to smell it and my family didn't notice it all. The musk reminds me of the kind of musk perfumes that were popular in the 90s, warm, subtle and nuanced.I like it- and nobody in my family objected to the scent. The throw on the candle was good without being overpowering."
2,31-May-15,5,"Tiffany Rose Bouquet in a Jar Scent traveled quickly throughout my house in minutes, not hours. Heady scent reminds me of burying your nose in a rose bush full of Tiffany blossoms. Smells exactly like the unlit candle...in fact, I can just leave the lid off the unlit candle and sitting 6' away I can still smell it. Thankfully, this wonderful scent, doesn't bother my allergies. Burns very clean with no wax left on the glass. It smells exactly as I hoped it would. Very pretty clear pink color; unlit it reminds me of Tiffany's, lit its almost identical to a Lovestruck Rose.I bought¬†  ¬†and¬†  ¬†jar candles directly from Yankee Candle, so I could compare them, as I couldn't find a review that did. It's hard not having access to a store to check out scents. I appreciate it when others write scent descriptions. I love the 'Fresh Cut Roses' candle scent, it's not an overpowering scent which the True Rose almost is. True Rose is a deep red candle. The unlit candle reminds me of a bouquet of red florist roses. It has a heavier, deeply damask rose scent when lit, but it doesn't carry that well. Basically, they smell like the color of roses they portray. I'll buy the Fresh Cut Roses candle again, but not the True Rose."
2,23-May-20,5,Beautiful Rose Scent I gave this Fresh Cut Roses Yankee candle to my mom as she loves roses. Yankee candle didn‚Äôt disappoint! She loved the candle & says it smells so much like roses she‚Äôd think freshly roses were sitting in her living room. The candle was packaged securely & was in mint condition. I gifted this quite some time ago & it‚Äôs still burning strong. Definitely recommend!
2,11-Mar-18,5,"Great quality candle I've long been a fan of Yankee Candles.  They are of excellent quality, burn evenly and nicely, and they last a really long time.  This candle is no exception.  The ""Sweet Nothings"" scent is nice for bathrooms or for a nursery.  I would describe the scent as ""sweet baby powder,"" as it does live up to its name.  This would make an excellent gift!  Update: Be sure to keep the wick trimmed so that the jar doesn't get all sooty.  This will keep the candle looking better."
2,5-Apr-18,5,"Gorgeous color and wonderful scent I have bought Yankee candles for decades because I love the quality and many of the fragrances. The sun-drenched apricot smells so fresh and is perfect for spring. The color is also really pretty and brightens up a shelf or counter. As with all Yankee candles, it's important that you burn it long enough to melt the wax all the way across the candle or you will get a ""divet"" that will eventually make the candle useless because the wax will keep putting out the flame. It's also a good idea to trim the wick as low as possible before you light it. This will make it melt across the top a little faster."
2,17-Mar-18,4,"Smells sweet and fresh Yankee are the best candles out there. they last forever (150 hours of burn time for the big ones!), burn clean and have a good amount of scent. The glass jar can be cleaned and re-purposed when the candle has been used up, and the variety of colors and scents will keep everyone happy.This candle as a sweet, vanilla scent with some soapy, fresh notes. It's a milder smell for a sweet candle (it's not hit you over the smells like most fall candles).The lovely purple color makes it blend in well to my bathroom, but this is really more of a ""family room"" type smell."
2,14-Sep-20,1,"Jar arrived smashed - dangerous and a big mess I sent this as a gift, and the glass arrived shattered and made a dangerous mess for the recipient. Not happy at all. It's taking forever for her to get a replacement."
2,3-Apr-18,4,"Subtle aroma, strong thick wick, long lasting in a hefty glass container with lid. I found the aroma to be pleasant and subtle and not overwhelming or artificial. The wick is robust and maintains the flame well. The size is very generous and should be long lasting. The robust glass container makes it much safer than freestanding candles and preserves the moisture of the wax and the scent when not in use. The heavy glass lid also extinguishes the flame when you need to safely wrap up it's use. A little pricy but as in all things you get what you pay for. Makes a very nice and hefty gift. Comes in a well protected and very secure box as well."
2,5-Mar-18,5,"Quality candle with a strong flowery scent Yankee Candles are very good quality candles. I already had a Christmas one that I love. The wildflower candle is green and has significantly more color than it appears to have in the photo. The scent is very strong and flowery, so this is for folks who don't mind--and actually enjoy--scented items. When not burning the candles, if you remove the lid, they can still scent a room. The candles are extremely well-packed and should be stored upright, especially in a hot climate. Do follow the instructions on the sticker on the bottom of the candle to get the best results."
2,8-Jun-18,4,Great candle - Scent is a little much It's a Yankee candle so you know you are getting a solid candle with a strong scent. It burns nicely and the scent resonates in the air around the house pretty fast. The candle lasted a while with me burning it intermittently over about 2 months.The only negative to me is that I didn't love the smell of this candle - it was a little too much of an old lady perfume type smell. I had never seen this candle before so I thought i would try it - I love Yankee candles but would probably leave this scent out of my selections in the future.
2,13-Apr-18,5,"Calm and Quiet Place Yankee Candle The aptly named ""calm and quiet place"" candle from Yankee candles lives up to its name.  It has a very calm, pleasing scent that doesn't overwhelm the room but does make it feel inviting and peaceful.  The soft mauve color of the candle is unobtrusive.  The candle was much larger than I expected, has a single wick and is projected to burn for approximately 110-150 hours.  While it may not become everyone's favorite scent, I also cannot imagine anyone finding it objectionable so is a great candle to burn when entertaining guests."
2,5-Mar-18,5,... a Yankee Candle in years and I forgot how wonderful they smell I haven't had a Yankee Candle in years and I forgot how wonderful they smell. The apricot rose scent makes me think of spring and it is such a nice aroma to make me feel hopeful while snowed-in. It burns for hours as long as you keep the wick trimmed. I had it burning all day yesterday and would just trim the wick every couple of hours and it looked almost new still. I wish these were soy as that is my preference but I think I will treat myself every once in awhile to a wonderfully scented Yankee Candle.
2,18-Aug-15,5,"Lilac Blossoms... are with us such a sort time each summer, and this a is perfect replication of their scent. It's like I just went and buried my nose in my neighbor's 65 year old lilac bush. Just like real lilac blossoms, the scent is a very strong with a heaviness to it. This scent keeps building the longer it burns. Candle has a great throw. When I first lit this, there was a soapy smell to it but that left quickly. Cold color is true to the lavender variety of lilacs. The wax pool color is true to the purple variety. This candle has not tunneled. The scent is as wonderful as I hoped and thankfully, it does not bother my allergies."
2,5-Mar-18,5,"Pleasant lavender and floral scent This ""Calm and Quiet Place"" candle has a nice scent--kind of a combination of lavender and floral. Yankee Candles are high quality--I have one and am glad to add this one to my collection. Gray is kind of the ""in"" color for interior decor, so this gray-colored candle fits right into cool gray decor like I have in our master bedroom. Follow the directions on the bottom of the candle to get many hours of enjoyment. Note: these candles should be stored upright, especially in hot weather."
2,18-Oct-20,1,"Buy Bath and Body Works, not Yankee Dont buy it. Waste of money. The candle doesn't last at all! The smell isn't too great either. Don't believe the hype."
2,22-Mar-18,5,"Five stars for sure .Highly recommended. Okay - I'm going to rave about this Yankee Candle. So many candles with fragrance are on the extremes -- either the fragrance is so underwhelming that I'm thinking, ""Why bother,"" or it's so strong and pungent that I'm bowled over by a wall of fake perfume. This candle has a VERY nice, pleasant fragrance that I thoroughly enjoy. It's name, A Calm & Quiet Place, is very appropriate, too. It creates a nice, pleasant atmosphere that I really like.  Five stars for sure .Highly recommended."
2,20-Mar-18,5,"Another great scent by Yankee Candle I love Yankee Candles and am so happy I can order them from Amazon!The packaging was great, a cardboard mold holds the candle to keep it from sliding, then two boxes for added stability.The jasmin scent is light and not too overwhelming like some floral scented Yankee Candles can be.  Best of all, these candles burn for a long time.  Even after burning it several times a week for over a month, the candle is has much burning lift left."
2,3-Apr-18,2,"Inconsequential Scent I was excited to find these at Walmart (same price) so that I could smell it before I bought it.  The reviews on this particular scent were great and it was often rated as the best scent of all their candles.  But scent is personal and I wasn't impressed.  It had a very light, inconsequential scent.  My favorite scent was Mainstay Woodland Sage that they just discontinued.  I smelled the Yankee Candle sage candle but it didn't work for me.  Back to the drawing board."
2,17-Mar-18,5,"Sweet, subtle new scent from Yankee Candle This is part of Yankee Candle's new Spring collection. It is a ""sweet"" subtle scent that is pleasant but not obtrusive, perfect for guests or relaxing. The official description of the scent of Yankee Candle's website is:Fragrance Notes:Cyclamen?Lotus Blossom?Vanilla, Powdery MuskTop note is the initial impression of the fragrance, middle note is the main body of the scent and base is its final impression."
2,16-Apr-18,5,"Smells amazing!!!!  Family favorite. Smells amazing!-I didn't even know you could get Yankee Candle on here.  Crazy.  I've been to their facility out in Western Mass.  It was ages ago but I'm sure it's still there!These have always been everyone's favorite candle.  Best scents, best smelling, best burning.  Huge thumbs up!-This new ""flavor""/scent is awesome - very fresh and floral.  Perfect for spring, if it ever gets here!!!"
2,18-Jul-19,1,"No smell!! Disappointed! This is one of my favorite yankee candle scents, so I was thrilled to receive this on an Amazon lightning deal, however, after burning the candle from 7 Am to 6 pm and NO SMELL OF ROSES to be had in my house, I am very disappointed. Wondering if it‚Äôs an authentic candle or a knock off?? I will return this candle and seek another elsewhere."
2,6-Mar-18,4,"Good Smell And Okay Throw ""Sweet Nothings"" seems to be a mixture of floral, vanilla, and musk.  The throw, while not as strong as most of the Yankee Candles we have bought over the years, is not too weak. After a couple of hours, we got a pretty good smell going in the room.  Good color also goes well in our family room.Overall, a pretty good scent.  Not my favorite and certainly not the worst one I've smelled."
2,12-Mar-18,5,"Great long burning candles. These are very good candles....burn for hours and have a pretty good throw.  The scent is not as strong as some of my wax melts, but for a long burning candle it is just right....not too overpowering.  I like the scent of this one as it is a really nice floral scent....it is like a field of wild flowers."
2,10-Mar-18,4,Spring scent for the new season I love Yankee Candles.  I feel they are superior in lasting smell and burning time.  They are quite fragrant.  This particular Sun Drenched scent reminds me of spring and makes the house fresh.  My only issue is while it arrived well wrapped in two boxes the entire lid and side of the jar was cracked.  I set it on an upside metal oven cover to use it.  Please work on the packaging.  Thank you.
2,12-Oct-20,5,"Nice candle with great scent Yankee Candle is a famous brand and I have used it all the time. I bought the pink sands scent Candle from Amazon this time. It is much cheaper compared to the retail store in the mall. The package is well protected. I really like the scent when I open it, the scent is not too strong and it makes me feel relax. I will buy it again as a Christmas gift for my family, nice candle and great experience."
2,28-Apr-20,5,One of my favorites! Love this scent! It is a very true to the flower scent. Not overpowering but nicely fills a couple rooms with scent. Long lasting and burns nicely. Have been buying this scent for years and will continue to buy!!
2,18-Oct-20,5,Great quality and a beautiful lingering scent This is my absolutely favorite scent and it smells so delightful & is lingering throughout the living room. This is a beautiful gift to give to someone and a quality product.
2,28-Feb-11,5,LOVE IT!!!! I absolutely LOVE this candle.  The previous reviewer who said that this is a more subtle scent is right.  It is more subtle than a lot of the other Yankee Candles.  That's one of the reasons I love it though.  Several people have asked me what my apartment smells like because they always notice a pleasant scent but can never figure out what it is.  I keep a Lavender Vanilla candle in my bedroom and living room with the lids off and burn them just a couple times a week for a hour or so.  That is all it takes to make this soft scent linger.  I have never had any trouble with the way these candles burn so maybe the other reviewer who did just had some bad luck with the one they purchased.
2,22-Apr-18,4,"Soft and Subtle Springtime Scent We use a lot of these Yankee Candle jar candles in our home and are very familiar with the product. This is the classic large jar with a new scent, Wildflower Blooms.  The scents are all subjetive of course, but I find this one to be a very subtle selection. For those who do not like overpowering scents, this will surely please them. It is like a little whisp of Springtime."
2,25-Apr-19,5,"Nice candle for the spring time Yankee Candles are usually expensive in stores but this candle was reasonably priced. I thought the scent would be of fresh roses but it literally smells like fresh cut roses aka the stems so I was slightly disappointed. But overall, it was good for the price and the color is perfect for spring."
2,9-Apr-18,2,"No Scent The Yankee Candle large jar is a beautiful candle and I love candles, but the fragrance is not strong at all. I am a fan of the Bath and Body Works 3 wick candles and they are heavily scented but Yankee candle barely has any scent.The Yankee Candle lasts a long time because it's a single wick candle but that maybe the reason it doesn't emit a strong scent."
2,6-Mar-18,4,Lightly scented and long lasting candle. This large jar candle by the Yankee Candle Co. is a quality candle that is mildly scented and not overpowering at all. It is 22 oz in size and will burn for hours creating a pleasant scent to the home. The sun-drenched apricot rose is a new scent and offers a light fresh scent. It is pink in color and can be placed in any room. It's a great summer fragrance.
2,5-Nov-20,5,Smells just like roses!!! Beautiful scent!  Really does smell just like roses! It's a great value to order it from prime! Love it and I wish I ordered more then one!
2,10-Mar-18,4,It will be better when it is actually spring and my windows will ... I don‚Äôt know what scent is used in a calm and quiet place but this is pleasant enough unless in a small place. It smells flowery which gave me a headache after awhile when it was burning in my living room. I moved it to another room and that helped diffuse the scent. It will be better when it is actually spring and my windows will be opened.
2,11-May-20,2,"Beware....You may not get what you order!!! I love Yankee Candles  so I was excited to find them on Amazon. I was disappointed when I received it because it had these white dry like bubbles as you can see. I burned the candle to see if it would go away, and it does but you have to wait until the top layer melts for it to disappear. I kept it because I bought it for myself but I would be embarrassed if I gifted this looking like this."
2,23-Apr-20,3,"Nothing to write home about This Wildflower Bloom candle is a pretty seafoam green with a light floral scent. It's wildly overpriced, of course, but it's a nice candle."
2,5-Mar-18,5,"Delightful, high quality candles I love the scent of this Sun-Drenched Apricot Rose scented candle. The scent is strong, but very clearly apricot and rose scented. These Yankee Candles are very high quality and can warm up the decor of a room. Do pay attention to the directions on the bottom of the jar to make sure you enjoy your candle safely."
2,7-Jun-20,5,Love it I received this as a gift. This is my first experience with this scent of Yankee candle. I absolutely love it and it is my new favorite.
2,1-Mar-15,2,"There may be a good scent but it's overshadowed by a chemical like aroma. I normally love Yankee Candle scents, but there are some that have an ingredient that reminds me of the smell of yellow gum erasers from my childhood.  (A sort of wax and chemical smell that tends to hang in the air)  I know it's an additives that in certain scents because I find the same odd aroma in some mens & womens colognes.  From what I can tell not everyone smells it but those that can, it seems that's all you are able to smell.  Clean Linen does a better job of having a bright and fresh smell."
2,25-Jul-19,5,"Perfect summer scent! This is a great scent for summer, it's refreshing but almost fruity? Hard to describe entirely. These candles always fill the whole room/house with the scent and it lasts a while! Great deal!"
2,5-Dec-16,1,"WAY too floral! Overpowering! Horrible fragrance.It's so potent you can taste it. The smell is overpowering and literally makes my eyes water. If you love potent, overly aggressive floral synthetic smells, then this is your candle. I can't, and I got this as a wedding gift and years after it still held its smell (was not uncapped), and I still want to retch with the fragrance."
2,27-Jan-20,3,"Not the usual Yankee Candle I love Yankee candles but this fragrance, Pink Sands was not very strong at all. Yankee candles are typically highly fragranced. This particular scent is not."
2,8-Apr-18,1,BRING BACK THE VINEYARD CANDLE pls THEY STOPPED MAKING MY FAVORITE CANDLE THE ONE THAT SMELLED LIKE GRAPES IT WAS SO GOOD AND NOW IM SAD THAT II CANT SMELL THE AMAZING SCENT WHEN I WAKE UP IN THE MORNING.  THE LADY AT THE STORE SAID THAT THEY ARE SELLING OUT IDK IF THIS CANDLE IS GOOD BUT I DO KNOW YANKEE CANDLE NOW ISNT BC THEY DECIDED TO STOP MAKING MY FAVORITE CANDLE.  PLS CONSIDER MY MESSAGE IM IN DYER NEED OF AN AMAZING CANDLE AND NONE OTHERS COMPETE. seriously though it would be really cool if you could start making it again I love that candle so much and I have like 10 but I go through them so quickly.
2,11-Mar-20,4,Still buying after years! I‚Äôve been buying this scent for years. I‚Äôm not a fan of yankee candles in general but love the rose smell. It smells up my whole room and lasts a lot longer than other candles. I‚Äôve had this for 2 months burning every night for a few hours and gone through 3-4 others that were more expensive. My only complaint is the black smoke that most yankee candles seem to give off. Don‚Äôt put this close to the wall
2,1-Nov-20,2,Needs better packaging. Partially melted. Candle had been melted slightly and leaked all over box and outside of candle. Still usable but a mess to clean up.
2,3-Apr-18,4,"Nice & Light I am allergic to strong scents but I like my house to smell nice, especially with a dog and two cats.  This is a light refreshing scent that doesn't send my allergies into a tizzy.  I strongly recommend this to anyone looking for a light scent that makes the room smell good."
2,12-Nov-20,1,"Not what I expected This is the first time that I purchase Yankee Candles. I am really disappointed because being so popular and expensive, I though that they would smell really good. I purchased 2 candles, lit them both, waited, and to my surprise, there was no smell at all. I don't like to give bad reviews, but I won't buy them again."
2,14-Feb-20,2,"Arrived broken, still usable. The candle was fine, but it wasnt packaged correctly - the glass jar broke in shipping. We have an extra candlestick so we just put the candle on there, and it's nice. Just dissapponting how it was shipped. A little forethought avoids that entirely."
2,16-Jul-18,5,"Its lovely and I would recommend it if you want a light fruity like scent This is a light fragrance that I think should have been called ""Pink Champagne"" instead of Pink Sands. There is nothing ""Beachy"" about it. Its lovely and I would recommend it if you want a light fruity like scent."
2,31-Oct-20,1,no scent What happened to Yankee brand? Last three jar candles had little to no scent.
2,24-Sep-18,5,My Favorite Candle! I got this as a gift and was somewhat skeptical based on the name... but it turned out to be my favorite candle scent! I burned through it quickly because I lit it every night before bed to give my room a nice calming aroma for sleep. Can't wait to restock!
2,30-Oct-20,4,"Scent is average . Longetivity is not perfect Yankee candles I got before were quite unique from the rest of the market competition,  however this one is not what I expected. However Yankee is still Yankee and I use it everyday for extra scent in my apartment. Maybe this specific scent is not the best. Also it does not last that long."
2,21-Jul-19,5,Bubble gum smell Gave this to my mom as a thank you gift for helping us out. Almost smells like bubble gum. But I love the scent and so does my mom.
2,6-Nov-20,3,"Less fragrant Less fragrant and not strong smell. It should be rich and strong for the large jar, But It doesn't. My smaller candle from other brand smells better. A little disappointed."
2,14-Jul-17,1,I ordered pink sand and got fresh cut roses instead. Not happy at all I would like a new one sent to me free of charge. I ordered pink Sands and got fresh cut roses instead. Not happy at all.  And it will be more money to send it back to you and wait for it. So now I'm stuck with the one that I don't want and I don't appreciate that at all
2,5-Feb-20,5,Awesome scent Purchased as a Christmas gift ?üéÅThe recipient and friends love the scent
2,19-May-18,5,"I loved this scent By the time I actually sat down to write this review, this candle was already gone.  I loved this scent.  It was fresh, but not too strong.  Subtle spring scent of flowers and all things alive - love love love!"
2,15-Nov-20,5,Great Candle I‚Äôm really happy with this candle. Smells really nice and fresh and has lasted me so long. Will purchase again!
2,27-Feb-20,5,One of the strongest scents This is one of the strongest scents in my opinion. Very nice
2,7-Oct-20,5,Fresh cut roses Fragrance is spot on! Gift
2,12-Nov-13,5,LOVE this candle! I just LOVE the scent of this candle! I didn't even know Yankee Candle made a scent like this. My husband knows that I love candles and surprised me by lighting a bunch of tea lights on our wedding day. I loved the scent so much that I ordered the large jar just to bring me back to the memory of our special wedding day. It smells of light white roses and I don't think the scent is overly powerful.
2,26-Aug-11,5,"Love the smell and the color is beautiful! I really enjoy items that have a rose scent. In addition, I have a bathroom decorated in a light pink and white color scheme. This Yankee Candle in Fresh Cut Roses made a perfect addition to my bathroom's decor. It's a pale, almost vintage pink color. The fragrance is bold and realistic. The scent from this candle when it is lit carries throughout the house. It burns nicely, and I haven't had any issue with tunneling. I absolutely love it!"
2,14-Nov-20,5,Great scent Smells good
2,19-Apr-19,5,Great value Love yankee candles was looking for a candle which I can add to my subscribe and save and found this one at a great price.
2,20-Jul-20,5,Will buy more. Smells so good!
2,12-Dec-19,5,"Amazing scent, great quality. I love the scent of this candle very much! It reminds me of spring and it makes the entire room smell. My candle arrived in perfect shape. Not broken. However, it would be better if they bubble wrapped them instead of the paper box they are put in so others don‚Äôt receive theirs broken!"
2,30-Nov-17,5,Yum Love the fresh and clean scent! It's my mom's favorite and I can't wait to gift it to her! Delivery was super fast and no broken candles or glass
2,16-Oct-20,5,Nice scent Love gardenia scent!Yankee candles are expensive but smells the best!
2,1-Aug-09,3,"Good Scent, Wish It Were Stronger! The Yankee Candle Lavender Vanilla scent is a good one - you can truly smell a touch of vanilla sprinkled in with the lavender.  The only problem is that you have to almost be right on top of the candle to really smell it.I have other Yankee Candle scents that are much stronger.  If you like something more subtle, then Vanilla Lavender is for you.  If you like a stronger scent, look elsewhere."
2,4-Jun-15,3,"Overpowering Smell For Us I purchased this YC Lilac Blossom candle for my grandmother for a mother's day gift. It smelled just like our lilac bushes when it was cold.When we burnt it however, the scent became over powering and we would have to blow it out. Once a relative stopped by after we had blown it out and asked who gave us Fuernal flowers? We passed the candle on to a friend who liked strong scented candles.If you are someone who enjoys a heavy scented candle than this candle is for you if not than you may want to pass on this product."
2,20-Oct-18,5,The best scent Of all the candle scents available this is my favorite. It permeates well through the whole downstairs of the house. Is it a light and easy to store.
2,2-Apr-18,5,You get a quality candle with a good burn life that provides a pretty strong scent Yankee Candle is sort of a known quantity.  You get a quality candle with a good burn life that provides a pretty strong scent.  These scent on this candle is sort of sugary and powdery.
2,9-Mar-18,5,"nice light scent nice light scent, not overpowering,  from Yankee candle.  I've always liked their brand as the candles burn cleanly.  The candle came very well packaged, so no worries about ordering online."
2,5-Sep-19,5,Smells refreshing Wonderful smell and carries in the house.One of my favorites (Salted Carmel is another)
2,28-May-12,5,"relaxing scent Well, this scent by Yankee Candle is sooooo relaxing. You can smell the 2 different scents in this and neither one is stronger than the other so it is in perfect balance. I like to light this one when I'm stressed, or my pets are stressed, like during storms. It is nice and relaxing at bed time too and with my teen sons room right next to mine, he can smell it and it helps him destress and sleep as well. Keep up the great work!"
2,18-Mar-18,5,Very nice and fragrant Very nice clean scent and well packaged to arrive in great shape.  I have issues with heavily scented candles and room fresheners and this one is a light fragrance and very soothing.
2,10-Jan-19,5,"Wonderful candle I absolutely love this candle, I‚Äôm excited I‚Äôll be receiving one every month. I wished they had the pink sand wax melts that are available every month I would sign up for those as well. My house smells amazing"
2,26-Jul-19,5,Great scent This is one of my favorite scents.  I love it.  Reminds me of the beach.
2,10-Jun-15,2,"Meadow Showers? Very little scent is noticed when the candle is unlit. Burns great with no tunneling. Has very little throw to this candle; I actually have to turn on my fan in order to smell this candle, and I‚Äôm only sitting 6‚Äô away. Once lit, it has a very sickly-sweet perfumy smell. It doesn‚Äôt remind me of any meadow I‚Äôve ever been in. To ‚Äòme‚Äô it smells like DEET bug spray. I don‚Äôt know if this is just a bad one or what, but I‚Äôm not keeping it. This candle does not bother my allergies. It doesn‚Äôt make sense to me on why it smells like this after reading other reviews."
2,4-Aug-19,5,Product is great and smell is wonderful filling up a whole room Product is great and smell is wonderful filling up a whole room
2,11-Jul-16,1,"Would not recommend this to anyone looking to use it indoors Gives me incredible headaches when used indoors. First time it happened I thought it was something else, but three times in a row after using this candle I had very strong headaches. Headaches were gone after airing out the room. Would not recommend this to anyone looking to use it indoors."
2,16-Dec-10,5,"a genuine rose scent! first off, i'm not a candle fan; however, i am a huge rose one.  this is the first candle i've ever spent money on, and i can't stop sniffing it.  nothing i own smells exactly like a real rose, even Jurlique's rose body oil (which is divine!) doesn't smell precisely of a fresh cut beaut. This, though, smells exactly like the real deal! Plus, I read somewhere that bubblegum pink relieves stress (that's why they paint some jail cell's that color!), and this scent combined with that color and the beautiful glass--it's a winner by every means.  hectic days are still here, but the stress isn't. :)"
2,19-Apr-08,5,"TRUE SCENTS I have spent a lot of money trying to find a candle that smells as advertised..YANKEE CANDLES are true to scent!The Lilac and the Fresh Cut Roses take me back to myGrandma's backyard, where the instant you open the door,all you smell are the roses and lilac's!IF you want the true smell, Yankee has it.HIGHLY RECOMMEND."
2,19-Jul-19,5,Nice Arrived on time perfectly packaged and true to advertised.
2,20-Jul-20,1,"Will break when shipped The candle is likely lovely, but we received it broken and then the replacement was broken as well.  Very disappointing that it is not shipped correctly to prevent the glass from breaking."
2,14-Apr-18,5,"Makes a wonderful gift Gave this as a gift, my friend absolutely loved it. She said it smelled incredible even before she took it out of the box. Beautiful color as well."
2,16-Sep-18,1,Scent is almost non-existent. The jar is pretty and the scent is nice when you smell the unlit candle.  I can't smell it when it is lit.  Waste of money.
2,18-Mar-18,5,"Smells like Spring! Great smell, makes my house smell like Spring, different but the combination of rose and apricot works well, very nice size too will last me months!"
2,29-Jul-19,5,Great quality The great quality to be expected with yankee candle
2,3-Jan-19,5,"great value, favorite scent love this scent, so nice to find it at a great price delivered right to my door :)"
2,20-Dec-18,5,Great product for Sprouters! Non GMO Organic. One of my favorite sprouting seeds.  Good quality with  high germination rate.  Cannot purchase a better product.  My neighbors will attest to that.
2,18-Nov-20,5,Christmas gift Got this for a Christmas gift. Love the smell of it and at such a great price!
2,7-Feb-20,5,Beautiful Smell! This is my all time favorite from Yankee. I burn this candle no matter what time of year. I also use the scent as my car freshener.
2,14-Jan-20,5,Definitely will buy again ‚ô° Smells amazing
2,10-Aug-20,5,Glorious candle! Soft floral scent. Not overpowering. Love the white candle!
2,24-Aug-19,5,Clean smell Love this smell. Last a long time.
2,7-Mar-18,4,high quality candle this is a high quality jar candle.  it was too floral smelling for me but a female coworker liked it so i gave it to her.
2,2-Sep-19,5,Good Good

2,10-Sep-19,5,Quality candle Beautiful scent
2,25-Oct-20,5,Good value for momey Nice and mild scent. I use in while cooking smelly food and works well.
2,28-Nov-19,1,Item damaged I received all the items I ordered today Nov 28th. they were all in good shape except the lavender candle. The wax was totally melted.
2,30-Jul-19,5,Wonderful scent! Strong Rose scent!
2,26-Nov-19,5,You won't be disappointed My mom loved this it's so strong fills the room with fresh lilacs
2,12-Jan-19,5,"Highly Recommend Very strong scent , Would purchase again."
2,22-Jul-19,5,Great smell Great smell
2,14-Oct-18,5,Thumbs up Great size for the money you spend.
2,19-Jul-19,5,love the smell love it!!!
2,6-Nov-17,5,"Great price for a great candle. This is one of  my favorites, very calming."
2,1-Jun-15,5,Fresh Cut Roses Scent traveled quickly throughout my house. Scent reminds me of burying your nose in a rose bush full of pink Tiffany blossoms. Smells exactly like the unlit candle. I can even just leave the lid off the unlit candle and sitting 6' away I can still smell it. Burns very clean with no wax left on the glass. It smells exactly as I hoped it would.
2,23-Jan-10,4,"Beach Walk The Beach Walk candle by Yankee Candle is a good spring or summer scent that contains a touch of orange, musk, and tangerine.  The candle also supposedly contains a scent of salt water, I really did not notice that.  Still, a good and strong scent.  A good candle when you want to have a ""fresh and clean"" scent in your room or house.Recommended."
2,29-Oct-14,5,"If you love the smell of roses If you love the smell of roses, you will love this candle. The scent fills the room with a delightful aroma of fresh cut roses. It is just lovely and the 2 wicks are very efficient. The glass tumbler seems more stable."
2,13-May-11,1,"Soot not scent As I have written in Amazon reviews of other Yankee Candles, I believe they are losing their scent! What I mean, is I think they are being reformulated, for whatever reasons, resulting in loss of fragrance. I have noticed this trend over the last 6 months to maybe a year. Anyhow, had the same problem with ""Pink Sands."" Now, it really did smell nice coming out of the box, so I was hopeful. But I could hardly smell it when burning. It was ""sooty,"" too, when burned--and actually set off our smoke alarm. (It was close to it, admittedly, but no large jar candle has done that before.) It is a pretty color, too, a shame it didn't perform. Yankee Candles used to make wonderful strong scented candles."
2,23-Aug-19,5,Fragrance doesn't overwhelm just beautiful Love this subtle beautiful fragrance
2,2-Sep-20,4,Broken candle jar Item arrived broken. Want my money returned. This was a birthday gift. She loved the scent but cannot use it in the condition it arrived in.
2,16-Apr-18,5,"Love Everything about this! Oh my goodness, this candle smells fabulous. Comes in a nice, thick jar."
2,14-Aug-20,1,Broken This product was a gift to someone.  I just learned that the Candle was broken when it arrived!
2,17-Oct-20,5,"Fresh, clean Wish I had bought more!"
2,6-May-16,1,"Arrived broken. Unfortunately, the Mothers's Day gift arrived in a thousand pieces.  She loved the candle. I was hoping to get the candle replaced, but could only return it for a refund.  Do I dare order again and hope it doesn't arrive broken again?"
2,27-Aug-20,5,"White Gardenia my favorite scent Awesome scent ..,will buy again."
2,10-Jun-20,5,Can't go wrong with a Yankee Candle! Enough said

2,23-Sep-16,4,I love it and it smells the whole house I love it and it smells the whole house. I place it in the master bedroom and I smell it in the living room. It is strong.
2,21-Oct-20,5,You won‚Äôt go wrong ordering this candle Absolutely wonderful color and scent and long lasting
2,31-Jan-19,1,"They suck Yankee candles are not the same, not buying anymore!"
2,28-Apr-18,1,"Don't recommend to purchase from Amazon. Buy in the store to check quality. Broken when received. It has a very weak smell and we think it's probably counterfeit because in addition to the smell and way it burns, the bottom label looks slightly different than one we bought in a store."
2,25-Oct-20,5,Pack it better I like it but it was broken in pics
2,10-Feb-17,5,Five Stars Yankee candles are the best bar none. They burn right and smell so good. Its amazing.
2,27-Feb-20,4,Good scent Good scent. Reminds me of the beach.
2,18-Aug-20,4,Awesome Awesome
2,20-Mar-14,5,"LOVE!  Long lasting and smells GREAT! As with all Yankee Candle products, this jar candle not only smells amazing, but it lasts a long time.  And the smells don't smell artificial like other cheaper products.  Yes, they are a little more expensive, but you end up buying fewer since they last.I really love the Midnight Jasmine scent.  Reminds me of Spring!"
2,11-Jun-13,5,Loooove Bought this candle for a friend. She loved it. She burned the whole thing up within 2 days! I would purchase the rose scent again. It truly does smell like roses.
2,19-Aug-19,3,Can‚Äôt smell it! I can‚Äôt smell it!
2,18-Sep-12,5,"yankee candle I absolutely love this scent. It has a wonderful aroma which doesn't leave a strong odor like some scent's do,and make's you feel like your on the beach. I highly recommend this to anyone."
2,3-Dec-19,5,Nice Nice
2,16-Oct-20,1,"Smells good, but I can't light it. Smells good, but I can't light it."
2,9-Mar-18,5,Wonderful fragrance in a long lasting jar candle. Wonderful new fragrance and Yankee quality. Already have had it lit for 10 hours and know that it will last a long time. Burns clean and the vase is beautiful. Will be reusing that when the candle finally burns down.
2,6-May-19,1,Candle without scent Can‚Äôt smell a thing
2,21-Jul-19,5,"Love it!! Love this scent smells like cabbage patch kids, I know its weird but its so soothing."
2,3-Apr-13,5,beautiful scent Yankee what can u say about this product! Yes it's a bit pricey but u do get what u pay for! Burnt all the way down and it really smells liked roses for sure! The scent lasted for the entire burn bout 4 days almost! I let my candles burn till there done of cause I take all necessary precautions! If u have children around I wouldn't recommend doing this! But once again yes it's a great candle overall. !!!
2,23-Jul-20,3,Broken glass. Glass was broken.
2,14-Dec-16,2,"Got two stars because it shows up unbroken and on ... Got two stars because it shows up unbroken and on time, but absolutely wrong kind. This is same one big lots sells because it had no odor:("
2,26-Nov-14,5,Five Stars Midnight Jasmine is still my mom's favorite candles.
2,2-Sep-16,1,"One Star Had it sent directly to friend, paid extra for giftwrapping.  Arrived broken :("
2,29-Jul-09,5,"A beautiful frangrance! I first fell in love with Yankee Candles when my best friend had taken me to Cracker Barrel, and they had a wonderful array of scents.  I came across this one, and instantly fell in love.  It does not have a harsh smell that will nauseate you.  It is a beautiful smell that makes you want to put on your bunny slippers, and relax.  I love it and I highly recommend it."
2,3-Jul-19,5,Smells great! We love them!
2,22-Feb-18,5,Quality Candles This aroma is awesome.  These are quality candles.  I love love love Yankee Candles!
2,2-Jul-17,5,Five Stars great gift!
2,17-Jun-17,5,I absolutely love this smell I absolutely love this smell. It reminds me of home as the scent is so similar to the real thing.
2,16-Dec-17,5,Five Stars Exactly as advertised.
2,28-Dec-13,1,"White gardenia candle smells like roach spray... Sent ""evergreen"" scented to candles to 6 relatives for Christmas.  They say they are enjoying them... (I hope!) However.. MY white gardenia candle smells like roach spray!!!!  (I haven't needed to spray for roaches for many years... but..every time I lite this candle.. it all comes horribly back..!!)  Thought you would want to know.. See what your scentprofessionals think.  Maybe the roach spray had a gardenia scent!! :)  Happy New Year.  klsdad"
2,28-Dec-10,5,"Ah-maz-ing This is an incredible scent. I did not buy it from here though. But I can atest to its greatness. It's very watermelony, but with some other interesting notes to it, and combines it's just an amazing fresh fruity scent! This will be a big hit for the Spring time!"
2,14-Apr-15,4,"I really like this scent so much I really like this scent so much. Its a very clean, refreshing, soft smell. However, I just wish the scent was stronger :D :D :D :D"
2,23-Nov-15,1,"Lavender is NOT lilac! ""Fragrance: An alluring grove of lavender, white, and purple lilacs.""Lavender is NOT lilac!They're both purple, both fragrant, both start with an ""L"", but THERE THE SIMILARITY ENDS. Completely different fragrances, but they push lavender because it blooms far longer than lilac, so it's really hard to find pure lilac scent anymore."
2,30-May-17,5,Five Stars The smell is as good and as real as i am looking for.
2,28-Jun-16,5,Five Stars One of my favorite scents!
2,27-Apr-12,4,Love Yankee candles! I love Yankee candles and while they are pricey they are a great treat! This scent was great although not too strong if you like strong scents.
2,14-Jan-11,5,"Wonderful Candle! The Housewarmer candles by Yankee are very pungent, which sometimes isn't so nice.  ""Midnight Jasmine"", however, is very pleasant, even in a small-ish bathroom setting."
2,3-Dec-17,5,"Logistics is great Great design  Prices have fallen sharply. Amazing price. We need a strong product, very good, great work! Have a good experience My wife is convenient to use Super invincible fast. Excellent"
2,16-Jul-14,5,Five Stars Love the fresh smell!!
2,8-Mar-15,2,Two Stars This candle has a very faint scent.
2,19-Jan-09,5,I would order this again. I would ordet this product again. It smells great and shipping was prompt anc accurate.
2,21-Feb-18,5,"Yankee did not disappoint I went out on a whim in getting this one. I had never smelled it, or even seen it in stores (I discovered upon looking into it that this is a new scent), and I thought why not? I am SO glad I went with my gut and just got it. The mix of the smells is just amazing. The apricot scent prevails over the rose for sure, which honestly surprised me! I feel like apricot is a hard smell to capture in a candle. The rose smell is also noticeable, but not over powering. It reminds me of the smell of Rosa  Double Delight roses (for those rose gurus out there) Which (for those of you who aren't gurus) is a sweet floral scent, with fruit like tones.This scent makes me feel super happy while its burning, and in my opinion is great for any time of day! I would use it in spring and summer, but not so much fall and winter if you live in a colder climate. Being currently in the desert that is Arizona, I would likely burn it any time of year."
2,5-May-20,5,"Wonderful Lavender These lavender candles are wonderful. The lavender smells like real lavender, not synthetic.  Candle lasts longer than any other brand.  The scent is not overwhelming~~just barely noticeable, but definitely there.  Also, this scent is very relaxing.  Lavender has been used since ancient days for its relaxing properties.  Do remember that before you light or relight a candle, you're supposed to cut the wick back to 1/4 inch~~~if you don't, the inside of the candle jar will brown out with ash residue."
2,9-Aug-20,1,"I want to like this candle, but cant recommend it given my experience. I have been using candles for years. This is the only one that ever made me feel ill if I left it on for more than hour in a room that is about 11 by 12 feet. I am willing to admit its possible I could have some allergy I never knew about from something they used in the candle making process.However. My very expensive coway air purifier that detects noxious smells and turns up accordingly has never been affected by any candles, even when i tried putting them literally a foot away it only turns up when I light or put them out.But this candle made it go off every time.Even then I wouldnt give them such a low star rating. Just thought it worth mentioning because people might not realize the candle is making them feel nauseous if that is the case.The reason I am writint this is because the candle was listed at beinf 35+ hours. And while I dont time it. I did not that my 10 hour candle lasted a lot longer than this thing did.Keep in mind these are mostly oppinions. Not actual facts if you want to be technical. The candle itself smelled very nice I thought.But for the price they charge, and given my experience? I can say I personally will never even bother buying such an overhyped object that basically amounts to a some wax, an essential oil and a wick. As well as whatever dyes or chemicals they used to make it so delightfully colorfull."
2,27-May-19,5,"Can‚Äôt beat this deal! Large Jar! Fast delivery! You can‚Äôt go wrong with Yankee Candles. I bought Bath and Body Works 3-wick candles during their winter sale online but nothing compares to the original makers of long-lasting scented candles. I found this particular scent is actually cheaper on Amazon vs. purchasing in stores. I ordered it at 10:30pm last night and it arrived at 10:30 am the next day. Saves me time, money, and gas! The 3 candles I bought on Bath and Body Works didn‚Äôt last long. I could no longer light the wicks even though there‚Äôs still a substantial amount of candle wax in the glass container. Plus the scent wears out fast. I do not experience those problems with a Yankee Candle.Tip: Burn the candle for at least 2 hours to get rid of odors. Extend the life of your candle by trimming the burnt part of the wick from time to time."
2,11-Dec-19,5,"Gardenia:  Gorgeous Warm Delightful I rarely purchase floral sceanted candles.  Actually, gardenia is the only floral scent I buy & only from Yankee Candle.  I live in Rhode Island & like to burn this on a warm summer evening when the air is still & the windows are open.  You know the nights when there‚Äôs no breeze & nothing is really moving; but I don‚Äôt need the a/c on.  I light 2 of these on my first floor which is open concept.  They give off the most beautiful, warm, soft gardenia scent.  It‚Äôs not heavy or cloying.  It doesn‚Äôt choke you.  It‚Äôs not super sweet.  You‚Äôd think it would be when you smell the candle.  But when you actually light it, it‚Äôs just so smooth & pretty.  I‚Äôve had an incredibly hard time finding this scent over the last few years.  I just happened across it on Amazon this summer for a great price & ordered a couple.  I thought they must be seconds or have something wrong w/ them; but, they were in perfect condition.  I couldn‚Äôt be happier.  ?üòÄ Amazon comes through again.  If you‚Äôve never tried gardenia, I highly recommend giving it a shot."
2,2-Nov-20,3,"Hit or miss I've been buying this candle on and off since 2019, but my last two purchases of this candle, the scent is barely there and underwhelming. Idk what's going on, but I haven't had an adequately perfumed candle in a while. But when you get a non-dud, the smell is so calming and it lasts for a very long time. Good luck"
2,6-Nov-20,1,"No Scent What a disappointment. Pink Sands sounds exactly like a fragrance I would like.  I eagerly pulled off the lid to take a whiff and ""nothing"".  Perhaps I just can't smell it, so I tried again.....""nothing"".  OK, so maybe I have to burn it for awhile to really smell it, again......""nothing"".  Have never had this happen before.  I buy a lot of candles, usually, in a store where I can smell them in advance.  But, during covid, thought I would buy some online and the price of pink sands on amazon was a good deal.  Perhaps this candle is so old that it just doesn't smell any more or perhaps it never did have much of a scent when it had one.  But, for certain, there is no fragrance now."
2,30-Jul-20,2,"Has no scent? I'm very confused, I normally buy Yankee Candles at TJ Maxx or HomeGoods and they have a much stronger scent! In fact I have this exact candle in a larger size that smells way better! It's like this candle wax is old and it gives off absolutely no scent whatsoever! I should have known better and saved my money. First time I ever ordered a candle like this online that I have bought in a store, I will never do it again. You think it has a great smell until you burn it and you realize it doesn't have a smell hardly at all! Like it's old or something. Unfortunately, you can't return it once you've lit the thing so I guess I won't be buying Yankee Candles online again"
2,8-Jul-20,2,"I've bought Yankee Candles on and off for over 40 years, and it's sad how low they've come I use to buy Yankee candles 40 years ago, and I remember lighting one candle in a room, and the smell would fill up the whole house. Guests always noticed, and my favorite was Midsummer's night. As the years went by, I noticed a marked decrease in the quality of the candles, although I would still buy them, hoping it was just my perception. This candle has a zillion positive reviews and I don't know why. It doesn't have any throw, it sells cheap, and there's nothing remarkable about it at all. Ounce per ounce, you should invest in Nest brand candles;  they are luxury candles, but nothing compares unless you want to pay several hundred dollars. The smells are complex yet pleasing, and there's something for everyone."
2,6-Jul-20,2,"Does not smell like actual gardenias. I have gardenias growing at my house, along the rear lanai.  They smell amazing when in bloom.  My lady friend always comments on how good they smell.  I thought I would buy this White Gardenia scented Yankee Candle as a gift for her.  While this candle has a pleasant smell It doesnt smell like real gardenias at all really.  To me it smells more like a clean laundry scented air freshener or something...  I likely will just end up buying real potted gardenias for her and probably return this."
2,5-Dec-19,5,"Yankee Candle Pink Sands Large Jar Candle ONLY $12.99 Yankee Candles Large Jar Candles for Only $12.99 is unheard of usually unless you buy several, they have flaws or the scents are discontinued.I was surprised to find my favorite scent at this price, so I had to buy one.  The wax is perfectly flat on top without any missing areas along the sides the jar and the wick is perfectly placed in the center. It‚Äôs perfect!!"
2,14-Apr-20,5,"Affordable, Timeless Candle. Must-Have. This brand has been around for so long. I remember it being THE candle to get years ago at the peak of its popularity, and honestly many products have come and gone and this one is holding up to its high reputation. It continues to be timeless.  The scent of Midnight Jasmine is perfect for those who just enjoy a light scent without being overwhelmed by strong smell. The candle itself lasts longer than any fancy candle I've ever bought. I love that you can remove the label so easily, since I normally like candles to just look simple/clean for decor reasons. Definitely worth it. If this review helped you in any way please make sure to click on helpful so I know. Feel free to ask any questions!"
2,24-Mar-19,3,"This Isn‚Äôt Cutting It For the amount of money and reputation of Yankee Candle, I‚Äôm slightly disappointed. Fragrance is great as always but it seems that with the tumblr jars, I have issues ‚Äî the jar candles never give me an problem, but I like the sleek, modern design of the tumblr candles. The wicks do not burn brightly for very long (my photos were taken about fifteen minutes into me lighting them) and they are already going down. By the time half an hour hits, the flames are so tiny, I don‚Äôt even know how they manage to stay lit. I mean, you could walk past it in a hurry and they blow out. I guess I‚Äôll stick to jar candles from now on. Great fragrance and design and wax quality, but the wicks are awful. I do keep maintenance on my candles, so I know it‚Äôs not me overusing the wick without trimming them. Again, I‚Äôll stick to jar candles. Still believe in the Yankee Candle brand. Hopefully they will be remade."
2,23-Oct-20,4,"Halloween Enchanted Enchanted Moon is a nice scent.  It is an older candle and they lose some scent.  Still, it does smell good and provides a perfect light for Halloween.  When you buy for half the price. You‚Äôre getting an older product.  If you want the freshest best throw, buy direct for full price.  Wax packaged well and candle was perfect."
2,15-Nov-19,3,"weakest scent ever from Yankee I have purchased Yankee Candles almost exclusively for many years.  Their fragrances are not anywhere close to a few years ago. I've always just counted on Yankee for my candle needs. This large jar Lilac Blossom is virtually scentless...even when burning, standing right over the candle, where I can feel the heat, it has almost no scent, and definitely no throw into even a small bathroom. It's not just me...read the blogs. Yankee has sold out. Time to buy another brand. I have purchased several other fragrances recently of yankee candles....each one a sad, weakly scented disappointment...total waste of time and money."
2,1-Aug-20,5,Fragrant but not over powering Strong scents give me migraines so I usually don‚Äôt burn candles or use essential oils in my home. I bought small jars of these rose scented candles for my son‚Äôs preschool teachers for Valentine‚Äôs Day last year and thought they smelled really nice. So I got this one for myself to try. It smells amazing and isn‚Äôt too strong and over powering (no headaches at all) but you can still smell it too. I had it burning during a family birthday party recently and several people asked what it was cause they really liked it.
2,10-Apr-20,1,"FAKE! DO NOT PURCHASE There is no way these are real Yankee candles. I got a Pink Sands Yankee candle for Christmas, and I loved it so much that I ordered 3 more on Amazon. The real one would literally permeate my entire home with the scent of a jolly rancher, and these have zero smell and burn down much too quickly. I thought I would save some money by purchasing on Amazon, but the joke was on me because I realized if you buy 3 large jars on the Yankee candle site, you get them for $18 each, which is pretty much what I paid for the 3 useless candles on Amazon. So disappointing."
2,6-Sep-18,4,"Smell is a true lilac, very strongly fragrant When I was a child my neighbor's house used to have a huge lilac bush.This really smells like true lilac.The strengths of the fragrance is remarkable, however if you are scent-sensitive like my son, this is not the candle for you.I took one star off because I realized that I am not such a fan of the lilac scent anymore as compared to childhood.I am not even confident that this is fair of me to do so.If you are a fan of lilac or flower scents, this is a very fragrant wonderful candle that you would truly enjoy."
2,29-Mar-16,3,Still Excellent But There Are Other Options Yankee Candles used to be the best.  They still are excellent but other candle makers are just as good while Yankee is still commanding a premium price.  The other makers are priced much more competitively; often half the Yankee price.  I won't name them here because that would make me look like a pitchman for them and I am not.  Look around.  I am a huge fan of the newer soy waxes in jar candles.
2,21-Sep-20,2,best to buy from store so it won't melt in the delivery truck Am so sad! I was really looking forward to this and its sideways melted and no wick..... so I only got wax in a glass..... guess the ac wasn't working in the truck it was brought in. I dont know how else to explain this almost 2inches clean off the glass omg!
2,29-Jan-12,5,"Do You Like the Scent of Gardenias Year-Round? If you like the scent of gardenias, this candle will scent your entire room.  My mother loves the smell of gardenias and when she moved to Palm Desert, California had gardenia plants planted in the garden beds under her bedroom window.  In the spring and fall she has 200 gardenia blooms typically scenting the air, but what about the rest of the year?To give her year-round gardenia scent, I bought her this for her birthday (January 24) and she just called and says she's sitting in her bedroom, reading a book with dog in lap, with this gardenia scented candle lit--the fragrance is suffusing the whole room. She says it's a light, soft fragrant scent, not heavy and overpowering.  She has thanked me several times for this gift--seems to have the candle lit at all times of the day and night.  It offers 100-150 hours of fragrance.  I'm going to buy one for myself for Valentines Day in lilac--she's convinced me.  A great gift for someone or for yourself--buy one in YOUR fragrant scent."
2,29-Aug-18,5,"beautiful. ""Calm Quiet Place"" smells like what youd imagine Rose from the titanics perfume smelled like.. soft and subtle but elegant and beautiful.. makes you feel good inside ?üôÇI lit this candle in the kitchen (open concept) so it could smell up my livingroom and kitchen etc. well after an hour or so i didnt smell it much so id say it isnt strong enough for larg areas.. however, i moved the candle to my master room and the scent exploded! it smells Godly in here! i will always keep this scent in my home :)"
2,11-Oct-19,2,Scent is Non-existent My opinion is that Yankee has gotten too comfortable with their fame and they're slacking. I bought the Pink Sand one and it has LITTLE TO NO SCENT! The only reason I have it any stars is because it's pretty when it burns and I like the color. What a bummer especially since these are so expensive. Too much hate to return a candle.
2,8-Feb-20,5,Love the smell of Lilacs!! I have always loved the smell of lilacs and this candle does not disappoint!! It doesn't take long at all for it to fill the house with the scent of fresh lilacs so I don't have to burn it for very long. This candle will last me for quite a long time so it really is worth the price!!
2,27-Feb-17,1,"Quality assurance is lacking Don't know the reason, but last two candles I bought from Yakee Candles were not the same as ones previously purchased. This one almost no scent. If this continues, this long term purchaser will switch to another brand.  The quality now seems 'hit or miss' when you order and it seems if you never know if your candle will be fragrant or a real dud.  So disappointing from a company that used to have a stellar reputation."
2,24-Aug-17,5,"Love Yankee Candles! I absolutely love Yankee candle!  This was a very good price and I love the scent.  I bought lavender because I read the scent can help with feeling calm and is good for around bed time.  I have a teen just starting high school who not only needs to be at the bus stop at 6:30am, but often has trouble going to sleep.  He actually lights this nightly and whether it truly works (lavender is known for this effect) or he just enjoys it, either way we love it."
2,4-May-20,1,"Awful Feels like a knock off. Doesn‚Äôt fill the room, barely smell it, burns really fast. Think it‚Äôs a fake."
2,6-Aug-17,3,"Good smell but arrived completely shattered I really wanted to write my reviews about the products themselves, not the way they were packed. The packaging of two was absolutely unacceptable. I ended up buying them at my local grocery store. They smell good and seem to last long. Be cautious when you are getting two or more of these."
2,2-Sep-15,5,"Can't go wrong with Yankee Candle :0 This was giving as a gift to my dear,  super busy sister in law--who juggles running her own Doctor's practice (on cal 24/7-no matter what) and raising 2 beautiful, and super talented teens that preform all over the U.S. with their various dance troops.  Yankee candles is the one thing I have found that makes her able to slow down a second and get to be ""in the moment"" for a second or two.  She has them all over their home, and the 1st thing she does when she gets home from her grueling day--she lights quite a few of her candles---(I am sure they all around her large bath-tub)  I noticed her mom came by and lit one that was not yet burning----the one I had just given her daughter.  I know what to always buy her any occasion. Unless a person just does not care for candles--you can not!! go wrong in giving these (and this exact brand!!!) for much appreciated gifts.  Thank you Amazon for making them available :o"
2,18-May-20,5,Great find! Lavender is my favorite scent for my bathrooms. They smell like bath soap and are not overpowering. This scent is impossible to find at the Yankee candle stores although the clerks tell me everyone e asks for them.
2,27-May-18,5,"FABULOUS FRESH SCENT As soon as removed from protective packaging from this YANKEE LARGE JAR ""BEACH WALK"" CANDLE I caught a whiff of it's SWEET FRESH FRAGRANCE. When lit, the room fills with the SWEET FRESH SCENT.To be honest, this pale blue ""BEACH WALK"" candle caught my eye because of high customer ratings and AMAZON MERCHANTS who offer at substantial savings. What does a walk on the beach smell like, after all; and do I want my home to smell like the mysterious scent? Not floral, herbal or musk. I highly recommend ""BEACH WALK"" for its RICH FRESH SCENT."
2,16-Sep-20,4,Lovely candle but be careful.... I purchased this for a Christmas gift and as I was removing it from the container - the lid was not on tight and it hit the floor and broke!  I had to reorder one.
2,31-May-20,5,"I'll never stop buying these ‚ô° This scent has sentimental value to me and my s/o. It reminds us of when we first started dating, and we always keep a backup in a closet somewhere. Something to note though is that this scent seems to be seasonal, it's almost impossible to find in the winter, but in the summer you can pretty much find it anywhere. So from late August to April I turn to Amazon for my fix."
2,22-Jun-20,3,"Hit and miss I had this in lilac and loved it. Then I got it in gardenia about 6 months later. The gardenia one doesn‚Äôt smell as strongly. The packaging is updated, I don‚Äôt know if they use less scent now or what."
2,28-Jan-19,5,"Scented & Crafted Beautifully. These candles last LONG! Most of the time, my favorite scents are not available through the official Yankee Candle store, so I head over here to find them! This candle packs a very fresh, vibrant scent of roses - as if they are right under your nose!! The wax is of such high quality that it burns a VERY long time, but in my experience, the Large classic jars last longer than the Tumblers. I have a rotation of scents I like in my room, and this amazing one is definitely in there."
2,9-Nov-18,5,Broken again Second review.  Although these are my favorite candles one was broke again.  First review. These are my favorite smelling candle and they last a long time. I ordered four.  Althouth they were packed well one was broken.  The top was upside down ant cruched the top.  I still was able to use it but would recommend watch when packing.  I will still continue to buy these candles anyways
2,26-Oct-20,5,"A defintite enhancement to any place. Excellent quality, long lasting candle. I leave the lid off when not in use, and within hours, the entire house is filled with the fragrance."
2,11-Jul-12,5,"Smells AMAZING! (if you like floral scents) If you love the smell of Night Jasmine in the spring, this candle is for you.This candle gives off a strong scent even when it's not lit, but it does not overpower your senses.Once you light the candle the room explodes with the floral elegance of the plant.  Absolutely love this scent.I would not recommend putting this in a 10x10 or smaller space, like a small office or bathroom.  I think it would be sensory overload.  Again, this is a dominate smell, unlike some yankee candles that have more undertones and have a earthy base.  This candle will fill a room fast of pure floral scent.If you do not like floral smells this is not the candle for you.I absolutely love it, but I know there are many who would not appreciate the ""bang ya over the head with a bat"" (but with flowers) when its lit.*WARNING:  If it's really really hot out (90-100) WAIT TO ORDER.My first candle melted during shipping.  SO I went to the store to purchase it again."
2,21-Apr-20,5,"Makes a great gift Someone recommended this scented candle to me.  I am usually into the more natural scents, like vanilla and eucalyptus, mint, etc. This candle is more of a candy scent- kind of like a starburst or something, but it's not overpowering. I actually quite enjoy it and it seems like it has a long long burn life. Great purchase!"
2,4-Jan-19,4,"The smell is to die for,bot much the fragrance value and burns of wax it melts. I love the smell of this lilac scented candle.Its a oerfect smell of lilac than ever I smelled in my whole like.Great price for the size and burns almost to when it needs to.Almost to the bottom,which some are not great in the past I tried and didnt burn out all the wax completely.It more smells fragrant in the jar than it brings out a smell in a room.Still its the best floral smell I smelled and its just worth so much.That it smells lije lilacs.The real thing."
2,26-Mar-20,2,"Totally disappointing. This smells like ripe bananas. :/ I don't get it. Pink Sands smells nothing like the beach/ocean -- at least not the candle I received. This smells like....bananas. Ripe bananas. I tried to like this -- I kept trying to think it smelled like a Banana Daquiri, but nope. It just smells like bananas that have been sitting on the counter for a bit too long. Yuck."
2,13-May-20,1,What a let down ! I read the reviews and decided to buy this candle because people were saying that it smells like The Bahamas White Sand Beaches ! It DOESN‚ÄôT! It smells like a whole bunch of NOTHING!!!!!! I let it burn for a whole day and could not smell anything ! NADA! So disappointed! I will go back and buy my Lilac Blossoms!
2,12-Apr-20,5,"Love Yankee I found meadow rain to be a little too linen for me. enchanted moon is wonderful, it smells like a mix of secret deodorant for women and chocolate. That doesn't sound good, but for some reason it really is. I would suggest not burning that candle unless you have already eaten because it will make you confusingly hungry."
2,24-Sep-20,3,"Fragrance somewhat overpowering While the candle does smell like a lilac bush, the smell is somewhat overpowering. The candle itself continues to have a high flame and sputters."
2,5-Nov-20,5,Lovely Delicate Roses I am so happy with this purchase! I felt I was gambling based in the reviews but this candle is so pleasant and delicate yet fills the entire room. The scent is not that artificial rose smell this genuinely smells like a Rose Garden after the rain. Anyone who loves Roses will love this!
2,24-Feb-18,4,"Great Smells amazing & burns evenly. Yankee candle has lost strength in fragrance over the last few years, so this candle is about a 7/10 rather than the full strength they used to be. I paid about $15 & I‚Äôd probably repurchase this one. Yankee just isn‚Äôt worth full retail prices anymore. Best description of this scent is a sweet, clean fragrance with a small hint of floral."
2,29-Jul-20,1,"Disappointed The candle smells lovely but both of the candles I received were broken!! The first one was broken and they sent out another one that was also broken. I ordered it as a gift for someone but I‚Äôm glad I had it delivered to me first, good thing. That would not have been a very good gift."
2,31-Dec-19,1,"Ew. It was used! A used candle - no matter how great the price was - is still a used candle. Yuck.There‚Äôs also some broken-off portion of the candle which makes me curious - like, how did this candle-lighter-then-returner manage to break off part of the candle, as well?Also, what kinda person returns a used candle? That‚Äôs pretty ballsy."
2,28-Feb-18,3,"Lightly scented As others have said, it has a very light scent. I use it in my hallway since the cat box is under a table in a corner there. If you want something highly scented this isn't the candle for you. If you want something that leaves a nice light scent then you'll like it. I would suggest you use it in a small area. I might move it to the hall bathroom but it's ok. It does have a scent after all."
2,24-Mar-19,5,"Another Yankee Candle Win I love the smell and formulation of this candle. The burn time is very stretched out and the aroma is very soothing, and comforting. I personally keep these in my bathrooms, because they match the aesthetic and the atmosphere of the room. Good quality wicks, long burn time, and an amazing, fresh scent. Highly recommended. This would also make a great gift. The smell is highly likeable!"
2,21-Sep-20,1,"Unhappy, not fragrant Scent not noticeable, possible old ? Very unhappy, Yankee candles are usually fragrant, this is not!"
2,6-Apr-20,1,Things happen - it‚Äôs not the end of the world ?üò? Well I‚Äôm sorry to say it was broke when received.I heard the broken glass as I picked it up.I ordered along with another one which came delivered yesterday it was perfect.  But really I can understand with the volume of packages that are being delivered today !The scent is great .... I‚Äôll try again when this crisis is over .....Thank you and STAY SAFE TO ALL THE WORKERS !
2,28-Apr-19,5,"Smells Amazing, Price is Great The price was about $10 cheaper on Amazon than on the Yankee Candle website and shipping was free with Prime, so you can't beat it. The smell is subtle and beautiful; not overwhelming at all, so it's a safe bet for a gift. I bought two for my mother in law and her sister for Easter. They both loved them. I will get one for my house because it's a great spring/summer scent."
2,30-Mar-15,5,"Adore this candle This candle is absolutely my favorite. When I first received it I thought the scent was going to be a little too earthy or musky, but when it's lit it smells absolutely wonderful and fills my whole house with the scent of real roses, not an artificial rose scent. It's lovely and calming. I absolutely love it.**Update 3/7/16**I ordered this candle again since the last one has now been completely burned down, and for some reason this new one isn't as heavily scented. While it's burning I don't experience the same amount of fragrance as I have in the past or what I've come to expect with Yankee Candles. I don't know if this is an older candle, but I did notice the label says ""A passion for fragrance"" underneath ""Yankee Candle"" and the candle I bought previously with a strong fragrance says ""America's Best Loved Candle"". I'm pretty disappointed that this new candle doesn't fill my home with the scent like previous candles have. I might take it to the Yankee Candle store to see if I can exchange it. Hopefully it's not a fake."
2,20-Sep-18,2,"Broken I bought two Yankee candles, Lilac Blossoms and Midnight Jasmine.  Both smell lovely but glass jar on the Jasmine arrived broken so I am only giving this one two stars. I was able to glue the pieces back on so at least it wasn't wasted. The Lilacs smell just like the flower but the Jasmine smells more like patchouli to me, still a lovely smell."
2,19-Jul-20,1,Scent is nice I was really looking forward to using this candle. I guess sitting in a HOT Delivery Truck not a good idea. The candle must have been laying on it's side because the wax was melted to the top of the candle lid. The wick isn't even visible.
2,26-Apr-17,5,"Great scent! Lovely and unusual scent! Not as strong as some of the staple scents I use (pink sands, sage and citrus) but will definitely buy again!"
2,31-Mar-20,2,"Hardly noticeable scent Even after hours of burning, I can't even notice the scent of this candle when it's sitting only two feet away from me. I love the scent, I just wish I could smell it! When using a Bath and Body Works 3-wick candle in the same manner, the scent is easily noticeable. I'll be sticking to Bath and Body Works 3-wick candles."
2,23-Jun-20,2,obviously already used! The item they sent me was already used. Wick was already burned andwax showed signs of having already been melted. Scent is very strong. Was going to be a gift but not going to give anybody something that's obviously already been used!
2,8-May-17,1,It does not have any fragrace! I've had it lit now for an hour and no fragrance has come out it as of yet.It is a just a plain was candle.
2,16-May-19,2,No Scent Non-Sense! I used to be a HUGE yankee candle fan! Maybe this one wasnt made up of the same chemicals/wax ingredients but even my boyfriend asked me send this back. We were looking for something to replace our constant flow of Bath and Body Works candles but we wont buy this again. Barely any scent - if at all - and still just as pricey as BB&W. Not worth it honestly.
2,26-Aug-20,4,Candle This is my first Yankee Candle purchase and I'm very happy with the purchase.  It looks great smells great and burns nicely.  No wick issues or deformities in the wax like some of the pictures I saw in the reviews.
2,5-Dec-19,5,Fragrance and it's heavenly. It is the best smell I love it and I used to sell Yankee Candles at a coffee shop. And I never had this scent and you will not regret getting this.
2,19-Sep-20,5,great scent original product arrived broken. It was sent back and replaced without difficulty. Great product.
2,15-Apr-19,1,"Don‚Äôt waste your money Highly disappointed in this product! I‚Äôve burnt Yankee Candles before and have never had an experience like this...  There‚Äôs constant black smoking coming from the wick when lit (no matter how many times and how short I trim it).  Also, the flame from the wick is easily about 4 inches tall and at least two inches outside the top of the jar.  I honestly can‚Äôt even leave the room for 1 minute when it‚Äôs lit because I‚Äôm afraid somehow a fire will start.  This purchase is definitely among my top worst Amazon purchase."
2,8-Jun-20,1,"No scent whatsoever I used to love Yankee Candles and bought them regularly because of their wonderful scent. I could smell them all over my house when I burned one.  However, over the past couple of years they have changed their formula and you can barely smell anything.  Regrettably, this was the case with this candle.  Unless you're standing right next to it you will not be able to discern any measurably throw in your area.  Not worth the money and I will, sadly, not buy any of their candles again."
2,8-Apr-18,5,"Love it! A good burning white gardenia candle is ... Love it!  A good burning white gardenia candle is hard to find.  I found lots of them but the ones I found are made withnot so good wax.  Yankee is a bit more expensive but for good reason.  I am a huge believer in ""you get what you pay for.""I highly recommend it and I'll definitely be ordering more!"
2,24-May-20,5,"Beach Walk Scent I bought this as a gift and I absolutely LOVE the scent.  Had no idea what it would be like, but I was following a beach themed gift, so I had to purchase it.  I am so glad I did and will purchase another for myself."
2,14-Apr-20,5,"Wakes up Loved the smell ,it gives my bedroom a fresh air feeling .i have had 3 compliments on it by friends dropping off food during this  Covid 19 period. I have been home 5 weeks now and so much rain I love to light up my candle"
2,26-Aug-20,3,"Mild scent and not long-lasting Never ordered a YC before and wanted to see what all the hub bub was about....disappointed the scent was so weak and the candle did not last very long. My $9 Better Homes & Gardens candles have stronger scents and last alot longer....oh well c'est la vie...not gonna buy another YC again, not worth it imo"
2,2-May-20,5,"A simple, beautiful scent. This scent, in a small jar form, was included in a 1800 Flowers birthday gift. The theme  - of course - was cut flowers...but the candle scent is more of a constant in my memory than the flowers. (This time!)As a result, I had to order the large jar, it helped with the quarantine too."
2,3-Feb-18,5,I didn't like how the first delivery was packaged and one of ... I didn't like how the first delivery was packaged and one of the candles shattered with glass bits everywhere.  I wish you carried the large size also.  The second delivery was much better and I am enjoying the candle scent. Thank you!  Joe
2,26-Mar-19,4,"Love the scent I haven't bought Yankee Candles in years because I thought they smoked too much, so I decided to try them again after reading about this scent in a magazine.  I would have rated it a little lower because it still smokes even if you trim the wick, but I really love the scent. It's a nice fresh and sweet fragrant smell that will suit any room."
2,30-Mar-18,4,Lavender I bought this candle based on most of the reviews saying that it has a sweet scent. I thought it actually has a strong lavender flowery scent. I didn't really get any sweetness. Its not bad but I prefer a sweeter scent.
2,8-Feb-20,5,They are the best. What else is there to say about Yankee Candle. They don‚Äôt have to be reviewed. They are the best in the market without a doubt. You will see this review on three other Scents. Yes I bought three. I love the candle they produce.
2,20-Feb-18,5,Would buy again! I enjoy the smell of this candle. It is not overpowering (I do wish it was a bit stronger). It is long burning the wax does not‚Äã run out as fast as the cheaper versions from Walmart. I love it. I leave it on all day. Would recommend.
2,28-Feb-20,5,"Soft floral scent to me First one arrived completely shattered. I've been hesitant to buy candles online due to them being so fragile. They immediately sent replacement.  I've always loved yankee candle. This scent is amazing.  Soft, sheer, floral scent."
2,8-Sep-20,5,One of my favorite Yankee scents I am a repeat buyer of this Yankee candle in this scent.  It is so relaxing to light at the end of the day with a glass of wine.  I will be buying again and again.  I do wish it would last longer though!
2,25-Sep-19,5,True Yankee candle I bought this candle about two weeks ago I love the lavender scent I burn in about two or three hours at night it‚Äôs about a quarter of the week on definitely in line with the Yankee candle brand because it slow burning would recommend
2,22-Jul-20,3,I got a melted candle ?ü•??ü•??ü•? umm ya so this happened I ordered 2 of this sent of candles the first one was good but the second one looks like it was on its side and melted I cant even see the wick what am I supposed to with this?!
2,24-Jul-19,1,"No scent This candle has no scent. It smells like lit up wax. I‚Äôve never been so disappointment in a purchase in my life, it‚Äôs definitely because of the cost and because it‚Äôs a Yankee candle, I would return it but have thrown away all the packaging.Don't purchase this scent."
2,24-Dec-19,5,YC is The BEST !!! This and Ocean Star are the best if you like beach scents.. also Sun & Sand... they discontinued Beach Flowers which was also amazing for beach lovers.. YC is the best quality & value for candles & home fragrance IMHO
2,3-Sep-20,3,Came shatter - smells good - but very disappointed as it is a gift for bridal shower Came completely shattered - I am for sure not able to gift this on Saturday. They will be sending me a replacement but I doubt it will be here in time. Very frustrated
2,12-Dec-19,5,"Smells great, great customer service Ordered this candle during the holiday rush, on its way it ended up being a cracked mess. When I reached out, they sent me a new one and have it lit right now!!! This scent is amazing, reminds me of spring as a child."
2,4-Apr-17,4,"Weird After-Smell This candle is genuine Yankee Candle. It filled my room with a lovely light smell. I wouldn't say it's exactly like roses, it does have a strange ""after-smell"" which I would compare to must. However, this item was on sale when I purchased it, so I would say for the price, I am satisfied."
2,11-Nov-20,5,I love the scent! I ordered this because it was on sale! I love Yankee Candles and I was happy to find some on amazon for 10.00 dollars! I wish they had more on sale!
2,18-May-17,5,"Beautiful Scented Candle! Yes, this came for Mother's Day! Thank you! Yankee Candles are my mother's favorite candles! And Gardenia is her favorite Scent! When she opened the gift and saw what it was, her eyes lit up and said , ""where did you find it?"" ""My favorite scent in my favorite candle!"" I couldn't be more happier. And the packaging was so secure as well! Thanks again for having such a great product! I am a very satisfied customer!"
2,5-Oct-20,2,"Disappointed I had such high hopes knowing that it was a Yankee Candle, but was sorely disappointed that the scent wasn't strong enough to fill a 10x15 room"
2,25-Aug-20,5,Love the scent Originally this was a housewarming gift. Loved it but hard to find. It's my favorite go-to Yankee Candle when I can find it at a decent price.
2,26-Sep-17,5,Smells like roses The scent of this candle is amazing. It actually smells like roses. There have been times where my boyfriend has lit the candle without me realizing it until I start wondering why our place smells like roses. This particular scent seems to carry well in the area too. I have another Yankee Candle that doesn't fill up the room as much as this one. If you like the smell of roses you should like this candle.
2,17-Feb-20,1,Busted into tiny shards This came to me shattered in tiny pieces with glass shards falling out of the box. I‚Äôm trying to figure out how to take this box to Kohl‚Äôs for return without getting glass everywhere.
2,11-Oct-20,5,Love it! Smells wonderful! I use an electric candle warmer to extend candle life so I can't speak to its longevity if you actually light the wick.
2,11-Mar-20,5,"Love the Scent When people come in my house, they compliment me on the fragrance. It is really nice. Not too flowery, not too weak. It does last a long time. I have two and I gifted my mother one."
2,8-Feb-19,5,"Yankee candle, like no other My wife likes Yankee candles better than the dozens of others I have bought her. Burn life is good, smell and variety of scents unbeatable"
2,24-Nov-18,3,"Love the candle smell but... for the first time with all the careful packaging, this candle arrived with the glass shattered and was a very dangerous situation to unpack. I buy these candles all the time and I have never had a broken one before. Very disappointed and will now have to order another candle for the Christmas holidays."
2,15-Aug-19,5,"Wonderful scent I love rose and other floral scents. This candle has a moderate strength scent; not enough to potently fill up a large room, but not too subtle either. So far it seems to burn at a good rate and evenly. Happy with this buy."
2,16-Feb-20,5,Perfect scent of lavender If you love Yankee candles they are perfect
2,11-Nov-20,5,"Keeps kitchen odor away, Lasting aroma Love the mild/lavender aroma that create perfect atmosphere! This is even good in removing odors in kitchen after cooking!"
2,25-Jun-20,1,don't trust them First delivery broken. Glass everywhere.  This one insanely melted and unuseable. I just opened it...too late to get a refund. What a rip off!!
2,16-Jun-13,4,"good for the price Reading the reviews is what prompted me to buy this candle. I always have some kind of candle burning in my house. It does smell pretty close to the fresh cut roses but not 100% spot on. I enjoy burning it pretty much all day long, but I have to say that scent throw is not very strong. My home office (where I have it) is about 10' x 10' and that is only where I can detect the scent. If I go into the living room, I can't smell it anymore. I have purchased Sladkin candles in the past and being a bit more expensive, they smell a lot stronger, making them a lot more economical, not having to burn them all the time. So the verdict is you get what you pay for. Fair."
2,10-Jun-16,5,"Best spring yankee candle I absolutely love these ! We had them all spring & several & I ordered more. Great & very strong lilac blossoms scent & very relaxing. Remindsme, where I come from as we got them growing all over place in nature & they smell wonderful ! Great seller, good price, fast delivery. Thank you."
2,20-Sep-18,5,"Lilac Blossoms This smells wonderful, like walking through a field of Lilacs.  I can smell it all the way downstairs from my bedroom just by opening and closing the door a few times i'm so obsessed i immediately ordered another one.  Sadly the other candle I ordered arrived with a broken jar so I hope my next one comes unscathed."
2,18-May-17,5,Very Wonderfully Scented and Pretty Candle! Very pretty! What a surprise when my mom opened this wonderful scented Yankee Candle along with the Gardenia scented Yankee candle that I gave her for Mothers Day! She couldn't be more pleased and happy! She thought they were the best gift ever!
2,2-Jun-20,2,"It stinks. It says the scent is Gardenia but, to me, it smells like Raid Roach spray... so it will become a candle used in case of a hurricane. Sadly."
2,23-Jul-19,1,Buyer Beware This candle can‚Äôt be a genuine yankee candle. All yankee candles have a strong smell that will fill up a room this candle doesn‚Äôt even smell at all. Total rip off
2,28-Jan-20,5,Nice gift Bought for my mom as Christmas gift. Wrapped very carefully and I was able to just wrap and give to her. Always smells wonderful and burns clean and even.
2,29-Apr-20,5,Smells great. Love this scent!  Some of the Yankee candle scents give me a headache but this one doesn‚Äôt.  These jar candles just burn so nicely.
2,5-Oct-19,1,Worse than citranella This doesn't smell like the beach at all. Unless your idea of the beach smells like an old lady's bathroom ?üòÇ. Can't believe I fell for this crap. Smells like Jean Natae perfume. Terrible.
2,13-Mar-20,4,"Smells like lilacs, more or less It's decent. It smells mostly like lilacs, although I've found better and less-expensive lilac candles out there. It DOES last a long time."
2,19-Aug-14,3,"You get what you pay for I didn't care much for this scent but decided to try it after reading the positive reviews.  The smell is very subtle until you walk out and come back into the room.  If you're looking for a subtle smell rather than an overwhelming one, then this is it.  Personally, I prefer the stronger, fruitier scents.  BUT the candle is still burning.  Yankee Candles are worth the price.  Also, check their website for more scents at the same price, only you have to pay for shipping."
2,7-Jul-19,5,"Just like a rose I'm very impressed with this candle, not all Yankee Candle's have this strong of a scent.  This one smells just like roses not too overpowering just very pleasant.  Highly recommend.  I even left it burning all night one night and it still has wax left."
2,18-Apr-20,1,"broken in transit This candle's scent is wonderful, however, the jar was broken in transit and I need to ?return? it for a refund???!!!  Really??!!  Why would they want it back just to throw it away?"
2,4-Dec-19,5,Wonderful smelling long lasting candle Actually this candle was actually is still not only burning as I light it everyday for an hour here and an hour there is really quite wonderful and I'm a guy so yes it does smell somewhat flour 80 but a very nice scent absolutely clears the air..!  I will buy it again for sure the exact one!
2,1-Jul-20,2,Not Good I love Gardenia scent but this was very weak and did not last! Not like the quality Yankee Candle is known for.
2,25-Jul-19,5,My favorite candle I love their true Gardenia scent and always take one of their candles with us while traveling for a wonderful scented room.
2,3-Aug-15,2,"Almost no throw - old stock? Pretty disappointed in the throw of this candle.  The scent is absolutely amazing, but I have to walk right up to it to smell it at all.  Perhaps old stock?  I guess that's the risk you take buying from Amazon and not direct from Yankee Candle."
2,20-Jun-19,1,"I was so disappointed The scent was nothing special.  I had caught the scent of the ""wedding candle"" at a bridal shower recently so I wanted it for my prayer room.  This one is nothing like the scent I remember.  :("
2,8-Oct-19,1,Very strong smelling The smell us not consistent with the stated scent and it gives me a terrible headache. I just wanted the reminiscence of my grandmother's garden and this just made me sick
2,12-May-19,1,"No smell I couldn‚Äôt smell anything, I let it burn for an hour, nothing. Getting up close, nothing. As far as longevity, after an hour I gave up, that‚Äôs unknown. Could be giftable but know for me there was no lavender smell."
2,16-Nov-20,1,"Candle has a faint scent I‚Äôm so sad, this candle doesn‚Äôt really smell like lavender at all. It‚Äôs very a faint scent. I won‚Äôt be purchasing from yankee again."
2,26-Jul-20,1,"Not happy Well, the first one was melted with no wick in sight.The replacement was broke upon arrival.I‚Äôll go to the store and buy one."
2,8-Jul-20,1,2 Broken Candle Delivered 2 separate orders and both broken.  The smell is amazing though but I must have received a batch that was damaged.
2,2-Mar-19,5,Pink sands is the best Pink sands is my favorite scent.  It smells fresh and clean but not overly perfume smelling.  The jar candles seem to last longer than the 2 wick candles.  I'll definitely be ordering more of these Yankee candles.
2,10-Aug-20,5,"Smells Divine, Burns a Long Time I like to burn scented candles in my living room. This Lavender candle has a very pleasant fragrance."
2,24-May-19,1,Waste of purchase--no scent! Major disappointment. I've been burning this for at least 6 hours and I don't smell anything!! This is the 2nd Yankee candle that hardly gives off any scent. Don't waste your $!! But another brand.
2,19-Aug-18,2,It smells pretty good. It smells like Gardenia. It came well packed if bought directly from Amazon.Revision #1: It gives me a headache. Reduced it from 4 stars to 2 stars.
2,23-Jun-13,5,"The Best Candle Company on the market I've always loved this product and other scents from this company. But, I have to admit I tried to save a bit of money and ordered from another company (Our Own Candle Company) because of their price and different types of scents. Never again will I do this because now I have grey walls from the black smoke from the candles. So, if I would have stayed with what I knew, I wouldn't have had to pay to have my walls cleaned and wasted money on a cheaper product. ""You get what you pay for"" rings loudly for me. Thanks for the excellent product."
2,22-Mar-19,1,Ya don‚Äôt always get what you pay for. This candle hardly even burns. The flame is so tiny and constantly goes out. I‚Äôm surprised at how terrible it was considering the price. I‚Äôve had much better (and cheaper) candles from Marshall‚Äôs and Ross.
2,14-Jan-20,5,"Great Scent, Great Price I bought 2 of these at a reduced price. One of my favorite scents for my bathroom, and the color matches too. Each candle came in it's own box so perfect for gift giving."
2,18-Aug-19,4,"too small Smells good, but size does not reflect the price."
2,16-Jul-20,5,Lilacs all year long! Just love this Yankee Candle! Smells like fresh lilacs which is nice after the fresh ones outside are gone!
2,8-Jan-13,4,"Scents and sensibilities.... In my world it doesn't hold that if a little is good, a lot must be better, so I like a scent that is fragrant but not overpowering; and of course any review of scents is completely dependent on personal taste. I rarely burn candles anymore, instead opting for my candle warmer, and I found this White Gardenia candle to be a pleasant  approximation of gardenia without being obnoxiously sweet. With the candle warmer I have only to flip a switch, and in minutes I can fill a room with a touch of gardenia, and several rooms within the hour. I like that."
2,25-Feb-19,4,VERY strong scent I loved this candle because it does smell so good.  It will fill the room with a beautiful scent.  The only thing I don't like is that they burn so quickly and often the wick is not right in the middle.
2,22-Apr-19,4,Discontinued scent... They don't makebthis fragrance anymore according to some store associates. I do feel the candle is overpriced but its such a lovely fragrance I went for it. It was packaged very securely.
2,6-Apr-17,5,My 2nd One.... .....who needs actually roses when u have this amazing jar full of happiness and romance....Soooooo in love with this Scent...I feel loved when I light this jar lol
2,13-Dec-19,5,"Heavenly All I can say is ""I want another one!"" I wish they weren't so high in price. That's the only thing I do not like. It's hard to buy them all the time on a fixed income."
2,4-May-18,5,The scent is like a lighter version of Vanilla A huge candle but packaged well. It has egg crate around the candle and then in a box. The box says what it is but it came in another box with another item. The scent is like a lighter version of Vanilla. I can't describe any other scent associated to it than that.
2,29-Aug-20,1,They need to learn how to package them better because the entire bottom of the glass jar was busted! The smell was good and that's all because the glass was broken and this is the second one
2,12-May-20,5,great value for Yankee great value for Yankee large candle. Perfect for everyday joy at home!! Sweet flowery scent.
2,14-Apr-20,5,I might re purchase again I have to burn it for awhile for it to actually smell like anything but the price is mice so idc
2,8-Jan-20,1,Don‚Äôt buy used one ! I guess it‚Äôs my fault to be cheap and bought used one but who knows if you never try right Lol. Anyone would tell me where is the wick ? Lol
2,7-Feb-20,5,Beautiful scent! My teen daughter specially asked to get the pink sand yankee candle for the holidays.  It is a wonderful scent.
2,18-Jul-19,5,"2 times received broken jars. I have had to have 2 replacement due to broken jars. This was a gift. Now it is a late gift. The boxes ok, you can hear the glass rattle around inside the box."
2,17-Jan-20,5,Worth every penny OMG what a great product. The smell is so beautiful. Although it is one wick the scent  that it leaves throughout your home is exceptional.
2,20-Dec-17,5,"Failproof Better price than the store and always a lovely scent for any time of year except maybe the heartless, disgusting month of February. It's light and sweet and I've found it to be one of the stronger scents."
2,19-May-19,5,"Good bargain Good scent, great price, average throw.  You wont be disappointed if buying this as a cheaper Yankee candle.  Coughing up the full $30 might leave you disappointed though."
2,31-Dec-18,5,Love it This is my favorite scent. Smells like real purple lilacs! Great to have because unfortuanately the real lilacs only stay in bloom about a week or so. Now I can enjoy the smell all year long if i want!
2,20-Oct-18,5,Long lasting and awesome scents Yankee candles just make the house so pleasant.  I especially love rose scent but there are soooooooo many to try.  They last a good long time.
2,1-Aug-20,5,You can still use it without a wick One issue. It was melted when I got it. Never order when it‚Äôs 100 plus degrees !
2,17-Feb-20,1,Smelled bad Smelled like a old church
2,14-Nov-20,5,The best smell not to strong but soothing I love the smell of this candle as it is gentle and soothing. I have ordered this candle quite a few times and it has always smelled the same and last quite a long time
2,7-Jun-18,3,"Smells like... candle. Back in the 1970s, all candles had a generic ""candle smell"" which was a vaguely floral and barely noticeable scent. This has Candle Smell in a YC jar. It wasn't what I was hoping for in a bathroom candle, but it will have to do I suppose."
2,19-Sep-19,3,Very Light Fragrance The scent was too light for me. I wanted it to get Zen and kill cooking odors. It really isn‚Äôt strong enough for a kitchen candle. Maybe in a small bedroom?
2,7-May-19,5,Love Yankee The smell is light (yet potent) and very spring/summer friendly. I light two of these puppies (sometimes one) after cleaning downstairs and it wafts to the upstairs in the most pleasant manner.
2,31-Dec-19,5,"Great Candle These candles are great.  They last longer than cheaper ones and if you get them on sale, they are very affordable."
2,17-Nov-19,5,"Awesome ! My mom has always wanted lavender yankee candels, I always told her they didnt have them, but surprisingly here they are. She will be in heaven, when she gets theses for Christmas. Shipping was also very fast and items were packaged good and never broken."
2,18-Nov-20,5,Fresh cut roses Love love love itGot it on sale in the wearhouse for $13
2,3-Jun-16,4,Smells great but misleading size of the jar. Smells amazing! Really smells like fresh cut roses and not like some horrible toilets spray.However this is a 7oz candle jar advertised with a 12.5oz picture. Very misleading!
2,26-Aug-19,1,"Almost No Scent This is a ""barely"" scented candle.  Yankee is NOT the company it used to be.  I will not buy another Yankee candle."
2,19-Nov-20,2,Poor quality The wick is buried in the wax! I have to destroy the candle to find it. Should be perfect for the price of it. Returning is not worth the time and energy. Very Disappointed!
2,26-Nov-19,5,"Good price and pleasant scent Great price this year, these cost a ton otherwise. Lilac is a good sunny season fragrance. Would buy again, good gift."
2,13-Jun-20,5,Great scent Great scent. I was able to easily pick up the smell thought the room.
2,19-Jul-20,2,"Arrived broken. The product itself is nice. Beware of buying it here, though. The jar arrived broken and when I asked for a replacement, that arrived broken as well. Please use better packaging."
2,23-Aug-20,5,Smells Beautiful It was a gift for my daughter in law and she loved it
2,28-Dec-19,5,Dog fart approved. Lasts long and smells fantastic. Smell wore off after about ten uses. Still covers up dog farts very well.
2,29-Jul-19,4,"Llama poderosa Por tener doble mecha y ser una vela grande,deber??a tener mayor fragancia.Tener cuidado donde la colocan porque a mi consideraci??n,la llama que produce es un poco grande"
2,12-Feb-20,1,Glass shattered! came broken in many pieces. I have bought many but now my 2nd broken yankee arrival. I will buy when i go shopping so it is not in pieces.
2,14-Dec-19,5,"Yankee candles are.my favorite. I only buy Yankee candles. Clean-burning, purity of scent, and long-lasting. They are my favoritee gifting item too."
2,28-Apr-20,4,"Pretty good, but.... Lucky if you can get a week out of this one and the scent isn't very strong."
2,5-Aug-18,5,Love Yankee Candles Smells just like freshly cut peonies.Fragrance lasts for the life of the candle
2,24-Jul-20,5,Long lasting great scent. Everyone knows Yankee Candles are the best. Just wish they weren't so expensive.
2,19-Jul-20,2,Cut by broken glass The candle was shattered when I opened the box. I was cut bysome of the shards. Smells great though.
2,13-Mar-19,5,"Love Yankee Candle This is one of my favorite scents! They are genuine Yankee Candle, and I use it for my office on a warmer. Will definitely order more for the future!"
2,23-Aug-19,2,Smells great but it was delivered broken!! I bought this candle as a gift to my friend since White Gardenia is her favorite scent but it was delivered to me broken! So disappointed!
2,31-May-19,5,My favorite!!! This is one of my two favorite scents from Yankee candles. I bought this as a Mother's Day gift and she really enjoyed it.
2,4-Jun-20,5,"Great gift/fast delivery Exactly as described.  Fast shipment, received in great condition, packaged well.  Great scent was a gift, the person who received this gift loved it."
2,6-May-20,5,Smells amazing This literally smells like a bouquet of roses! I absolutely love it!
2,29-Mar-19,5,"5 Stars I love Yankee Candle Company. I especially love this Rose scented candle. Smells is amazing. Not powdery or overwhelming. A subtle, fresh smell. Burns slow."
2,25-Jul-20,5,My Favorite scent Yankee candles are the best it smells just like theyr advertised
2,5-Feb-20,5,Lovely scent but arrived broken Unfortunately it arrived damaged. Lovely scent but i could do without the broken glass. Amazon is great tho at replacing damaged or defective items.
2,10-Aug-20,5,Nice scent I love having this in my bathroom.  Nice scent but not overpowering.
2,6-Jul-19,5,"Great candle It‚Äôs worth the extra cost because it lasts longer than the cheaper candles, and smells much stronger."
2,24-Aug-20,5,Don't buy this fragrance This candle smells more like oil versus the fragrance. I am greatly disappointed. I have another lemongrass candle by this company and its awesome. I am going to send in back.
2,6-May-19,5,Gift My mom loves it! It packs a lot of scent in a little package. Doesn‚Äôt have to be burned long for the scent to stay around.
2,3-Sep-18,5,Smells soooooooo good! Got this candle as a gift and loved it! The smell is so beautiful but not overpowering. I highly recommend it!
2,25-Nov-19,5,Best bang for your buck Best candle I've had in a long time. Less than half the price of what I can find it in the store for
2,26-Aug-20,4,Lilac I love yankee candles the pricee Ed has always been a little over priced.
2,12-Feb-20,5,Roses Brings in LOVE! I like my home to smell of roses to bring in LOVE!  It is a fresh smell of roses!
2,12-Sep-20,5,candles I love this scent and I love Yankee Candles
2,8-Nov-14,3,"The candle was wrapped so well it took me easily 30 minutes to undo the bubble wrap It would be preferred if Amazon would be more forthcoming about ""Used"" items being broken. The candle was wrapped so well it took me easily 30 minutes to undo the bubble wrap.  Yes, there was a piece (rather large) missing which meant the cover would not stay on.  Shipping further damaged it as two more pieces of the jar came off with the wrapping. It is not burnable as the breakage exposes at least two inches of the wax.  I will keep it for the fragrance alone. A valuable lesson for me to learn that ""Used"" - even though re-wrapped - is a risk!"
2,23-Nov-19,1,Did not order this Never ordered this and now I have card fraud and my card is off. So who ever used my card info I hope you like the candle
2,9-Dec-18,5,As described Thanks
2,15-Apr-20,5,Must have!!! Best smell EVER!!! I grew up with a gardenia bush right next to my bedroom window. Takes me back to my childhood ‚ù§Ô?è‚ù§Ô?è‚ù§Ô?è‚ù§Ô?è
2,19-Dec-19,3,"Not authentic! Doesn't seem authentic. Yankee candles usually smell amazing & last a very long time, this one hardly compared."
2,4-Nov-17,4,"Great service and product The candle was exactly what I thought it would be, a candle. Lol. I ordered two but one broke during shipping. I was refunded my money with no issues. I was very satisfied and would order this item again."
2,3-Jul-15,5,"Like standing in the center of a rose garden I love this candle scent! Its strong, not overly strong, and smells like REAL roses. I am a rose enthusiast and for me personally it reminded me of real rose oils. Particularly picked up the scents of traditional red rose and turkish roses, I love the combination scent! Great service as always from Amazon and Yankee Candle, and arrived in very well protected packaged. 5/5"
2,14-Nov-12,5,"True Rose Scent I really enjoy the scent of this candle.  It is not overpowering like some flower scented candles I've tried.  The scent is light and genuinely smells like roses.  I use this candle year round, but especially appreciate it in winter when the windows have to be shut and things get a bit stuffy.  Some strong scents affect my asthma and make my husband stuffed up.  This one doesn't  bother either of us, so if you have allergies like we do it might be worth a try."
2,16-Sep-11,5,"Yankee candles make the BEST rose scented candle! I am already a big fan of Yankee candles & think they are far superior over most candles (but even with that being said, they do have a few ""stinkers"" in the bunch). Not Fresh Cut Roses. It is my all time favorite scent they make. It comes the closest to smelling like the real thing than any other rose scented candle I've ever tried. I would say it's a medium scented candle. Not too overpowering & not so weak that you can barely smell it. I highly recommend it!"
2,3-Jan-20,5,Great gift for lilac lovers My mom loves lilacs so I got her this for xmas.  Smells wonderful.  Great price too.
2,24-Apr-18,5,"Strongest and BEST smelling Yankee Candle Strongest and BEST smelling Yankee Candle! Was delivered in 2 days in perfect condition. I've bought more than one 'Large' YC from Amazon, and they always arrive as if they had come straight from the store. Would recommend this product to anyone who wants their home to smell like springtime and lilacs!"
2,14-Jun-19,5,Favorite Summer scent Creates a great aroma in the house with a few of these burner.  Yankee Candle quality.  None better.
2,8-Feb-20,5,Love it I love the scent very strong. Great gift. It's small but not too small candle.
2,11-Dec-19,5,Wonderful Scent It came fast and in perfect condition. The scent is so beautiful! I highly recommend!
2,1-May-19,5,Heavenly Scent This candle has a wonderful scent.  Fresh and reminds me of when I walk at night when the night blooming jasmine in my neighborhood has blossomed.  I love it.
2,7-Dec-17,5,This is my favorite fragrance. They last for a really long time You can‚Äôt beat a Yankee Candle.  This is my favorite fragrance.  They last for a really long time.
2,30-Jun-20,3,Candle arrived broken into pieces The candle smells wonderful. I gave it 3 stars because it arrived broken but I'm still keeping it. they really need to pack it much better
2,9-Apr-19,3,"Not much at all I burned this candle, and forgot it was burning. I think it would be good if a couple candles in a living room.  But I don't recommend it in a large room."
2,22-Jul-20,3,Melted My candles came melted unfortunately.
2,31-Oct-19,4,Not bad Nice smell.  A bit fruity for me but luckily it's not too overwhelming.  Lasts a long time.
2,12-Oct-18,5,"Great buy Best smelling yankee candle there is that isn't food related! Its fresh and yummy and sweet and rich at all once. Plus, it lasts foreverrrr. I could probably burn it night and day for five days straight."
2,29-Jun-18,5,"My sister loves it I bought this for my sisters wedding, she loved it which is all that matters, but i no longer buy your candles, too much money for no throw."
2,14-Feb-20,5,Nicely scented and fairly long lasting candle. I like the scent of this candle and the burn life is fairly long.
2,1-Sep-20,4,okay. Good Scent. Burbs well.
2,18-May-20,5,"Get it The smell is incredible. Fresh, very fresh."
2,29-Apr-19,5,Soft rose scent. This is by far my favorite rose scented candle! It is a soft floral scent that you can smell even in a larger room. The candle also lasts for a long time. Definitely recommend!
2,14-May-20,5,"my favorite! i purchase these every chance i get, great price and quick shipping, THANKS!!!!"
2,8-Mar-19,2,"candle I love yankee candles but this scent was weak to barely  any sent,"
2,29-Apr-19,5,"Beautiful candle I like the color, and the scent before lighting, once lit however, it has to burn for an extended period of time before the aroma fills the room."
2,28-Jul-20,5,Pleasant lilac scent Realistic lilac scent freshens entire living area.  I‚Äôm glad I finally tried the Lilac!
2,31-Mar-20,2,smells like old lady perfume terrible smell. very different than the description. I would never buy again.
2,11-Jun-20,5,WOW---wwww!!!! Extremely powerful and sweet scent.
2,19-Jul-20,5,Great candles Great quality and very pleased with purchase.
2,6-Jan-19,1,Came completely broken I can‚Äôt use this because it came shattered. Before I even opened the box I could hear the glass rattling around. Amazon not being helpful with replacing the item. Surprise ?üôÑ
2,14-Aug-20,3,Nice and pretty but fragrance was off This did not smell like lavender.
2,28-Jan-20,5,Fresh flowers The best smell to me is fresh flowers. That‚Äôs what this is like
2,27-Jan-20,5,Smells so good! Great candle and great price. Delivered with care. Can't go wrong here.
2,27-Nov-19,5,"Scent, presentation Bought this for my girlfriend, it's her favorite smell reminds her of her grandmother and childhood. Beautiful presentation, amazing scent. Will purchase again"
2,29-Jan-19,5,It‚Äôs Lavendar alright Doesn‚Äôt smell like true lavender up close but if you let the smell disperse through your house then you have a really solid fresh lavender scent. Very pleased with Yankee Candle once again!
2,5-Feb-19,2,Average Candle Not as fragrant as other less expensive candles I have purchased. It was not calming and relaxing like lavender should be.  Too expensive and not worth it!
2,23-Mar-19,5,Smells so good Smells like enchanted roses.
2,11-Jun-20,5,Beautiful scent The best frangrance EVER!!
2,13-May-19,5,"Very light Scented Very Pretty?üòä This candle is a gift for a friend Very light scent ,but very pretty .I know she will love it Thank you?üòä"
2,21-Dec-16,4,"Fairly easy to clean up though Product came on-time, and the product itself is always stellar. I gave 4/5 stars because the jar arrived in the box a little messy. It seems as though some of the wax escaped the jar and made a greasy mess. Fairly easy to clean up though, and the candle itself was in perfect condition, just a bit gross."
2,31-Jan-20,5,Coming up roses Omg my whole house smells like fresh cut roses.love it.
2,20-Mar-19,3,Lavender/Vanilla Love the smell of Lavender/Vanilla but this candle does not have a very strong smell.  Can hardly tell at all in a small room.

2,8-Mar-20,5,Amazing scent! Love this scent!! My whole house smells amazing with this one candle!
2,30-Jun-19,3,"No more relaxing Lavender, So had to take this one This does not take the place of Relaxing Lavender.  It does not have the same scent or as strong.  This is a bummer."
2,27-Jan-20,5,Best gift ever What a great gift and scent to give LITERALLY anyone.
2,9-Apr-18,1,Wrong candle received- and already burned  before received Love this scent (White Gardenia) and ordered this candle and received Coconut Beach. And Coconut Beach had been burned before.
2,25-Aug-19,4,‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§ Love the relaxing lilac scent after a long work night...Yankee Candle always is the best
2,20-Sep-17,4,Cute 4 stars because although it's awesome and I love Yankee Candle and how they make candles for tons of occasions (I am giving this to brother and future sister-in-law). It smells strongly of roses and kinda old /dusty flowers smell.
2,25-Feb-20,5,"Long lasting fragrance,  it's heaven. My son loved this as a gift. The smell is very aromatic and lasting."
2,17-Nov-17,4,Four Stars VERRRY STRONG BE AWARE. Also there was oil all over the glass when I opened it?
2,21-Dec-19,5,"Love the scent I normally don‚Äôt buy scented stuff online since I can‚Äôt smell it, but I took the chance with this one. It smelled so good that I bought another for my mom."
2,11-Feb-18,3,NOT What Yankee used to Be Not a Strong Scent. Burns uneven. Wick breaks off while burning and falls into the wax. Only giving a 3 Star because I got it on a Clearance Sale Price.
2,10-Feb-20,1,"scentless did not like, wish I had bought a stronger scent."
2,23-Jan-19,2,"No scent If you put it in a small room and close the door, you can smell the scent. Otherwise, it has practically no scent at all. Very disappointed with this lack of quality from Yankee Candle. I won't buy this again and probably won't buy another YC unless I can smell it in person first......:("

2,13-Feb-20,5,"Great quality as always! The scent is divine, not overpowering at all."
2,5-Sep-16,3,"Box and candle covered in oil?? The candle itself is just fine. However, my product arrived covered in a strange oil... I had to wash the candle 5x with soap and water to get it off, and the label peeled off from all the oil. Some other oil-based perfumed product must have broken on or near the box. The box the candle was in was also covered in oil. Not a great experience for a premium product ($25 candle) - will not purchase online again."
2,26-Nov-19,5,Lasts a long time I used this every day and the tumbler size lasts for months

2,22-Dec-19,2,"Scent seems very weak I used to love Yankee Candles.  Anymore, I don‚Äôt think they smell as fragrant. They used to be able to fill up my house with a lovely scent, but anymore I need to burn several to get that.  Very disappointed."

2,31-Oct-18,2,Where‚Äôs the scent? What has happened to the scent? In burning yankee candles you could smell it throughout your home (which I loved.) now I don‚Äôt even know I‚Äôm burning a candle.
2,27-Jun-19,4,Okay but look around It‚Äôs okay. Shop around & look for price value before you commit to this particular one

2,30-May-17,5,"Very long burn hours and heavenly lilac scent My first Yankee candle and I can't believe the difference from other candle. It is long burning, which is fantastic to get so many hours out of it, and it fills an entire floor of my house with the most realistic and heavenly lilac scent"

2,17-Jul-19,5,Great quality Love the white gardenia scent of this candle. It‚Äôs very light and fresh.
2,2-Jun-15,3,"disappointed I bought the candle for myself.  If I had bought it for a gift it was not presentable to give.  It must have melted somewhat in transit, and there was an empty space on one side, and a bump on the top which I had to pare away with a knife in order to find the wick.  I can still use and enjoy it, but like I mentioned.....if I had purchased it as a gift it would not be presentable enough to give."
2,1-Jun-12,5,"Great candle This candle smells great, and is well-constructed in a thick glass jar with a robust top.  The burn time has been good so far and it's not smoky at all.  It can be a pain to light once the wax wears down, but that's how all ""jar"" candles are I suppose.The smell is fairly mild and pleasant.  It's not offensive like many of the ""fruity"" pungent candles.  This is my second favorite after ""fresh linen."""
2,30-Jan-20,5,Amazing My favorite yankee candle.
2,29-Jan-19,5,"Love the smell Love the smell. Expensive as it is Yankee Candle, but, I could not find other good candles with jasmine scent"

2,14-Sep-20,1,FAKE YANKEE CANDLES This is not a real yankee candle. The sticker has been placed on the candle and put in a Yankee Candle box. Has no scent before burning nor after lighting the candle.
2,17-Feb-18,5,"Good quality Although it doesn't smell like pure roses, it does smell very pleasant and works really well. The scent covers 2 rooms and a hall. Will purchase again at that price. Very satisfied."

2,16-May-17,5,SMELLS JUST LIKE REAL LILACS I got this for my Mom who loves the smell of LILACS this really does smell like you have a tree in the living room. You cannot go wrong with candles. Plus it being a Yankee Candle you know the smell is spot on.
2,12-Feb-18,5,Lifesaver I participated in an office secret Santa over the the holidays and the person I got requested this scent. Of course I waited until the last minute to sing out it was sold out at all the Yankee Candle stores and website!! Amazon saves my life and it was cheaper. My coworker loved it.

2,17-Mar-16,5,"She's happy! It's a calming I ordered this for our German friend, as it's a difficult scent to find over yonder. She's happy! It's a calming, less overwhelming scent, and I enjoy it, too. Arrived in perfect shape, burns longer than expected. Very happy!"
2,1-Aug-13,5,My favorite scent I brought one of these as a gift for my friend about a year ago. I liked it so much I've been buying them ever since for myself. This candle has a light sweet scent that fills my house without being overpowering.Update...I still like this product itself however I will never buy it from Amazon again.  I left package feedback with Amazon as well.  When I got my candle it was open with oil leaking everywhere and the wax was melted and coming out of the jar all on one side.  I live in a hot climate but still if it had been packaged better I wouldn't have been so disappointed but I'm still happy.  I called Amazon and they gave me a full refund so no hard feelings.

2,19-Dec-14,4,Nice candle This is a nice candle.  You can tell its a higher quality than the cheaper ones that you get in stores. The fragrance is very nice and does smell like lilacs. I read several reviews that said the fragrance was subtle and another that said it was mild.  It's actually quite strong.
2,22-Jan-14,5,"Lilac is GOOD Lilac has always been my favorite fragrance,  When  I learned a new family member also liked lilac I purchased this candle as a Christmas gift for her.  Her eyes lit up as she opened it and smelled it.  She was happy.  Do not know if she has lit it yet but since she has had these before I am sure she will enjoy it when she does burn it."

2,28-Oct-19,5,Awesome candle! Smelled so good!
2,31-Jan-18,4,"A bit too strng for me but yet a very delightful scent. This candle smells very nice & delightful. I will say it is VERY strong so if you like strong scents this is a great match. I wish the scent was just a but more subtle but that is only my personal preference. The color is a lovely light pink shade and looks exactly as displayed in the photo. I really like Yankee candles but I have to say this one is not my fave. It is however, a nice addition to the yankee candles that I already have.I hope this review helps you! :) I try to be objective, detailed and always completely honest with my reviews.

2,2-Sep-14,5,Yankee Candle Gardenia This candle smells wonderful ‚Äì for whatever reason though after about 20 minutes it starts giving me a headache.

2,29-Dec-13,3,"can't smell the fragrance!!! I was skeptical about buying this based on the reviews that said that this doesn't have a strong fragrant smell. However, since I love the smell of gardenia's, I bought it anyway.  I agree with the reviewers-there is a FAINT whiff of gardenia, but you really have to make a conscious effort to smell it.  Not worth the $$ and will not buy again."

2,19-Jan-19,5,Great scent One of my favorite floral scents
2,23-Jun-13,5,"The Best Candle company on the market I've always loved this product and other scents from this company. But, I have to admit I tried to save a bit of money and ordered from another company (Our Own Candle Company) because of their price and different types of scents. Never again will I do this because now I have grey walls from the black smoke from the candles. So, if I would have stayed with what I knew, I wouldn't have had to pay to have my walls cleaned and wasted money on a cheaper product. ""You get what you pay for"" rings loudly for me. Thanks for the excellent product."
2,2-Jan-19,5,Smells great! Smells great!!! Lasts a good while.
2,23-May-20,2,Does not smell like gardenia. This did not smell like gardenia at all. It just smells like floral and perfume. Disappointed.

2,8-Dec-15,3,The smell is true... the only reason ... The smell is true... the only reason I have gave it 3 stars is because it came broken. This is a gift mailed directly to the person. Trying to work with someone else having them mail it back has proven to be nothing more then a headache since I don't own a printer to print out a new shipping label to return it Amazon from another state..
2,25-Feb-17,3,Strong scent Has distinct rose scent but I would not agree with the reviewers saying that it is a light scent or not very strong. The scent is very evident and strong. Gave my roommate a headache after only a short period of burning the candle.

2,16-Aug-17,5,"Burn long, smell great So I finally tackled my Keriophobia situation by buying every flavor of Yankee Candle that was included in the special pricing recently.  When they arrived (all different days oddly enough), I opened them all up, took a giant whiff, placed them in a perfect circle, sat in the middle, and then I carefully lit them.  As the wax melted I dipped my finger in each candle and when I felt the pain of the hot wax I yelled ""Keriophobia!""  Terrifying.  But now I am not afraid of candles.  Which will make birthday parties for my kids go a LOT smoother."
2,8-Apr-16,5,"Great gift! My favorite Yankee candle fragrance. It's a lovely smell, not overpowering, can be used year round, and a great gift. Highly recommend."

2,30-Dec-14,5,"Wonderfully authentic and true, while not overwhelming or ""pungent"" It's amazing how this smells exactly like the lilacs that grew in Mom & Dad's backyard. The scent really brings me back to happy summers. It's flowery for sure, but not sickeningly sweet (like some of the other floral and fruit offerings by Yankee). I'd describe it as authentic yet even-toned; maybe even slightly understated. It's kinda like walking by the flowers in a greenhouse or farmer's market on a mildly warm summer day. I wouldn't change the formula at all - it's perfectly balanced. This has been a family staple item for years."
2,15-Sep-17,5,Five Stars Beautiful scent - is not as strong as most Yankee candles.

2,8-Mar-18,4,Four Stars good scent
2,7-Sep-13,4,"A Great Long Lasting Candle The Good:  We've been using these candles for years.  We love them and will continue to buy them.  They last for a very long time, give off pleasant but not overpowering fragrances, and come in a nice, stylist glass container.  We probably have 4 or 5 in the house right now in fact.The Bad:  On the downside, they are fairly expensive, especially when compared against other generic candles.  Additionally, when the candle starts to get low, the smoke tends to blacken the upper lip of the glass container, and is fairly unsightly.  Still, these negatives will not prevent me from"

2,23-Jun-13,5,"Best Candle Company I've always loved this product and other scents from this company. But, I have to admit I tried to save a bit of money and ordered from another company (Our Own Candle Company) because of their price and different types of scents. Never again will I do this because now I have grey walls from the black smoke from the candles. So, if I would have stayed with what I knew, I wouldn't have had to pay to have my walls cleaned and wasted money on a cheaper product. ""You get what you pay for"" rings loudly for me. Thanks for the excellent product."

2,14-Feb-14,5,"Great candle! It has a STRONG sent that fills up my bedroom! some guy complained about it not using up all the wax. that is because the jar is very round and not very tall. You really only want to use this candle if you can let it sit for a couple hours. otherwise it won't use up all the wax and it'll be bad. someone else also complained about the wick. yes, the wick is a little long so the flame is slightly higher than I would prefer, but other than that I don't see any problem with it. I love this candle and use it all the time to give my bedroom a great smell! Great buy! oh and I chose yankee candle because I saw them on Undercover Boss (a cool TV show) and their CEO was such a great guy that I HAD to buy from them ;) The episode is on Netflix if any of you guys want to see."

2,7-Dec-17,4,Four Stars The scent is very nice although it is a bit strong
2,17-Apr-12,5,"Great Smelling, True Scent. I love Yankee Candle and wanted to try something different. This is very true, and strong. With that being mentioned, it might be too strong for some. But suited our household fine. It does seem to burn a bit faster that the other scents I've tried, and it smokes a bit. (Even with the wick trimmed and all that). Would buy again."
2,27-May-16,5,Five Stars Smells great
2,6-May-14,5,Fresh springtime scent. This is my favorite scented candle.  The scent of this brand lasts longer than others do.  The rose scent gives a year-round feel of spring to my home.  I also find this scent hard to find in stores because it sells out quickly.
2,14-Aug-12,5,"Rose Yankee Candle I purchased this candle for my sister for her birthday.  No one locally had this particular scent, which she requested.  It came wrapped so well we had a difficult time getting it out.  The scent is not overpowering like some others I've purchased, but it does last."
2,25-Jul-16,5,Five Stars The best!
2,13-Jul-14,5,LOVE it! Absolutely LOVE this scent! It's powerful and subtle all at the same time!

2,13-Dec-10,5,"Smells wonderful I've smelled many candles that claimed to have a ""fresh rose scent"", but I have to say that this candle really lives up to its name. If you love the smell of roses or potpourri, this is the candle for you."

2,3-May-15,5,Awesome canlde Ash the smell of lilacs
2,26-Sep-16,5,Five Stars nice smelly candle lol
2,8-Jan-14,4,"Nice, but doesn't have a very strong scent This is a pretty nice candle. Like all Yankee Candles, the candle lasts a very long time. The only thing I wish was different was if the scent was a bit stronger. I can only smell it once I get really close to it."
2,6-Apr-16,5,"Great smelling, giant, and worth it. Smells great! Has a much better smell than the candles I've been picking up from Walgreens over the month. Much sweeter, love to burn it before sleeping as it's relaxing."
2,13-Nov-09,1,"burns poorly Because of the undersized wick, the flame is never large enough to generate much smell.  The tiny flame consumes so little wax that, over time, it merely burns a whole down through the center of the candle, leaving a 3/4-inch thick layer of wax all the way around the inside of the glass container.  While I've had some really good Yankee candles, this one is definitely not worth the money and may be my last from this company."
2,14-Feb-15,5,Five Stars Smell great!!! Love them!!!
2,16-Mar-16,1,"One Star Smells amazing , bad packaging , the jar arrived cracked with broken pieces"

2,22-Jul-16,5,"Five Stars love it, me encanta"
2,31-Mar-14,2,"Great scent but you can hardly smell it I was looking for a fragrance to fill my small living room.  I typically buy Mystic House candles but wanted to try these due to the high reviews on the smell.  It is true that they smell great but you have to be literally hovering over the candle to smell it.  If you need this fragrance to noticeably fill a room, this is not the candle for you."
2,3-Oct-14,5,Great candle Love the scent.
2,16-Sep-14,5,Five Stars My favorite scent
2,17-Mar-16,5,"Amazing This candle is hands down amazing.The scent will please anyone, as well as it creates little to none smoke once blown out. Great size, WORTH IT!!"

2,28-May-14,5,its a candle I mean its a candle right?What possibly can go wrong other than buying a smell you dont know ;-)
2,22-Jan-15,3,"Love this candle Love this candle, and was a good price. The shipping was an issue, since the jar was broken when it came. We just took it out of the jar, wiped the broken glass off, and use it as a free-standing candle now. Not worth the effort to return it, but you'd think they would better protect a glass item for shipping."
2,30-Apr-18,5,Five Stars It was great.
2,20-Jan-17,1,Arrived in pieces. So disappointed...it arrived in pieces but smelled great. Too much trouble to send back for replacement.

2,15-Aug-17,1,"Rancid This is one of my favorite Yankee Candle scents, but this particular candle made the entire ground floor of my house smell like a mix between a dead carcass and cheap perfume. I would definitely suggest just purchasing Yankee Candle products directly from an authorized retail store."
2,30-Apr-16,2,"Two Stars The candle wax was dripping down the outside of the jar, very messy."
2,12-Apr-16,5,Five Stars Great purchase!

2,27-Jul-15,5,Five Stars Bought several in the past and was pleased. Delivered as described.
2,29-Aug-14,5,"The great memories it brings back... Pink sands has a very sweet tender scent I love it so much because of how much of great memories it brings back for my husband and I back then when we first got engaged and let it lit up all time in our hotel room, smelling it again brings back all the sweet memories <3 the scent is very soothing and sweet it's not too spiced up or too fruity like other scent it's just the right blend for a perfect scent that you want clinging to your room and identifies your home with a lovely scent that doesn't get mixed up with food and spices or fruits. The wick burns perfectly and it's very long lasting. Pink sands is my all time favorite and will always be."
2,29-Jun-16,5,Excellent item. Love the fragrance Excellent item.  Love the fragrance.  Carefully packed this time.
2,16-Dec-16,5,Smells just like fresh cut roses Very strong scent!  Smells just like fresh cut roses!

2,16-Sep-17,4,Four Stars Love it
2,28-Aug-13,1,"It arrived with the glass shattered. Not packed well enough, I fear.  It was wrapped in bubble wrap, but it needs to have several layers around it.  As for the scent, I've used it for some time and it smells exactly like a huge lilac bush.  Scents a whole room easily."
2,3-Mar-14,5,awesome The candle was Yankee candle standard awesome I got it for girlfriend n she was very happy which makes me happy

2,8-Oct-12,2,yankee candle large this candle has a very strong wax in the air.  it smell good though.  if you have a big room like maybe 20x20 it might be ok.  but my room was 13x12 and it was overpowering with the smell of wax.
2,24-Oct-17,5,Five Stars Same review as Strawberry Lemon Ice.
2,26-Jan-15,5,Five Stars for sure
2,15-Dec-12,5,"smells really authentic I smelled this at a yankee candle store and loved it. ordered it online for my sis for xmas, as it is her favorite scent. would highly recommend if you love lilacs!"

2,6-Nov-12,5,"SMELLS SO GOOD Great product! Burns nicely, smells great and lights up my room (y'know, b/c I don't have power thanks to Hurricane Sandy!)"
2,24-Apr-14,2,Not that Great This candle did  arrive on time but really was not what I expected.To me it did  not seem to do any better than a candle that cost $5.00 dollars.I am sorry I bought it but I learned a big lesson on the information I thought was right.
2,25-Jul-15,5,"Five Stars Smells absoloutly amazing! Not overwhelming, and lasts a long time :)"
2,6-Mar-16,5,Five Stars Perfect present for my wife.
2,18-Mar-16,5,Five Stars GOOD!!

2,7-Jan-17,5,I really liked this product I really liked this product.
2,10-Dec-14,5,Five Stars love it
2,14-Jan-14,1,Arrived Broken I got a refund but it really was packaged horribly. No surprise it broke. It's a bummer because I really wanted to take a chance on Yankee Candle. I guess I should have kept my loyalty with Bath and Body Works.
2,23-Mar-12,5,Pretty candle and nice smell I bought this to use on the dinner table for Valentine's Day.  I wouldn't mind a perfume that smelled like this candle.  Very nice.
2,21-Feb-17,5,Five Stars Good price
2,3-Sep-13,4,Lovely fragrance Never had this candle scent before and it is really nice.  The aroma just taking the lid off is strong and I love the color.  It fits in great in the room I am using it.  Thanks Amazon!
2,1-Feb-15,5,Quality Gift I knocked my Mom's Birthday out of the water with her favorite candle ever; Yankee Candle - Freshly Cut Roses.
2,15-Jan-14,1,Not happy My wife gave it wrapped to her sister and when she opened it the wax was deformed and no wick was found.
2,21-Jun-16,5,Five Stars Absolutely  Love it.
2,15-Apr-15,1,One Star No smell of Jasmine.
2,26-Aug-15,5,Five Stars Can't get enough of the smell!
2,2-Mar-17,1,Weak scent. I have it sitting not 4 feet from my head and i still can not smell anything. You have to put your nose right up to it. It's a shame i was looking forward to it.
2,14-Feb-16,1,One Star No scent.
2,23-Aug-12,4,Very strong scent!!! I love the smell of gardenias but this candle is extremely strong.  It is a little too strong for my 2 bedroom apartment to handle.  If you have a large space then this is the candle for you.  It also burns a little fast.
2,8-May-17,2,where's the great scent?? I never spent this much on a candle but thought I would give it a try to hopefully to add a fragrance to my room. After 5 minutes of burning there was no scent coming from it and I was only 3 feet away from it
2,26-Jul-14,5,Five Stars awesome smell
2,21-Apr-13,1,"An  absolute waste If I could have given this candle negative. stars I eagerly would have. The scent it produced was barely noticeable from a foot away. I don't think I should have to risk singeing. my nose to earn the tiniest whiff of gardenia. A candle of that size AND price should be capable of filling much of room with the delightful fragrance of gardenia. It might as well have been either unlit or in a different home-miles away.  For the price it was a gigantic disappointment. Even it it had been free,  it would not have been a bargain.  I feel cheated, ripped off and not a little angry. Fellow gardenia lovers,  avoid this product by all means and save yourselves. cost, disappointment,  and anger."
2,14-Apr-13,5,"Nice memories. Yankee Candle's Beach Walk brings back heartwarming memories of Hampton Beach and the ever fresh scent of sunshine, beach towels and salty air from the Atlantic. This candle is truly wonderful. It has it's own unique scent, very comforting and light.Highly recommend if you have wonderful memories of the ocean and family vacations on the coast. This is my favorite ""ocean"" scent next to YC's Midnight Cove."

2,4-May-14,3,"Try the actual website Too expensive. Try yankeecandle.com for a better price. The smell is spot on though. Good candle, bad price. Lol lol"
2,27-Apr-13,5,"This time of year..'Dreams'. Nice, non-spicy scent for Spring. Puts me in the mood for the beach with 'new sprouts' and a hint of citrus along with sea air."
2,24-Jul-16,4,"Would Purchase Jar Candle - Just Not This Scent The person I bought it for loves these large candle jars.  They weren't real impressed with the scent, but love Yankee Candle."
2,16-Dec-15,2,Wick was ridiculously short! I had to return this item because the wick was not long enough to light the candle! The fragrance was ok. I would not choose this one again. Very disappointed.
2,18-Jan-14,5,Great! Yankee candles have always been a reliable brand for me when it came to purchasing candles. My wife loves these candles!
2,16-Jul-16,1,"Cheap rose smell. The fragrance is thick and cheap, clearly doesn't feel like natural roses. Sometimes I feel nauseated by it. And I am stuck with it because how do you return a candle."
2,24-Oct-13,5,Great Deal Got this as a gift for a friend. Awesome price compared to in store prices of these candels. She Loved it.
2,8-Aug-17,5,"Probably my favorite summer candle to burn Yo, this smells bomb. Probably my favorite summer candle to burn, but I burn it all year round. I'm super into lighting Yankee candles all over my house like a weird old cat lady, but this one is by far my fave."
2,24-May-14,3,"it's okay It's okay. the scent is beautiful; all I need to do is take the lid off and it refreshes the room. it will last and last because when I do burn it, it only needs to burn for a short time to freshen up the room. I give it 3 stars because it is not my favorite of the Yankee Candle scents, but still a good purchase."
2,23-Sep-17,1,No Scent detected.. I have never paid this much for a candle but wanted to see if the brand lived up to it's reputation. Very disapointed. no smell my dollar store brand had a better value.
2,14-Mar-17,1,it do not last long for the price they selling ... it do not last long for the price they selling it for and it do not smell where you can tell it burning I will never buy another  Yankee Candle
2,6-Dec-15,5,Scent is awesome Awesome. Scent is Fresh roses and not too strong just right. Love it and very please with this scent.
2,15-Feb-14,5,Shower present I thought that this was a really cute bridal shower present for a couple that already had most of what they needed. It smells really good and most women love a Yankee Candle!
2,13-Dec-13,1,i ordered 3 of them and i got one wrong scent :( i ordereed 3 22 ounce jars and i only got two of the right scent and i got no invoice slip soooooo now I'm stuck with the wrong NOT matching scents :(
2,30-Jul-16,5,"Great Candle Nice, fresh "" sunshine"" scent!"
2,26-Aug-17,5,Can't beat Yankee candles. wonderful.  I don't even have to light it.  Just take the top off and it fills the room with fragrance.
2,28-Aug-15,4,Four Stars A great buy for me. Thank you very much. Hope to do business with you again.
2,7-Mar-16,5,Five Stars Smells great and very high quality. Was a christmas gift and it has a great scent to it.
2,2-Apr-13,2,"Strong smell of Roses Do not at all like the smell, it is a wedding gift, hope they like the strong scent of roses"
2,4-Jun-18,5,I prefer Village Candles- longer burn and better smell. Mother in law loves this candle. I prefer Village Candles- longer burn and better smell.
2,28-Nov-17,4,sniff sniff Smells nice!

2,22-Nov-15,5,Five Stars Yankee candles are wonderful- and this scent is amazing!
2,29-Aug-17,5,"Five Stars It's wonderful to get one of my favorite scented Yankee candle at a lower price, thank you!"
2,12-Mar-17,3,Nice candle but overpriced. Nice smelling candle but not worth the price.
2,30-Jun-14,5,Lilac Blossum Mom Loved it!
2,3-Jan-14,2,"Not a soy candle I didn't know the difference between soy candles and wax candles when I bought this. It burned nicely, but , it burns down through the candle and a lot of wax is left on the side. A soy candle burns the whole candle. From now on, I will look for soy candles."
2,21-Jan-18,5,Five Stars Product was as described and arrived on time.
2,3-Mar-17,5,Five Stars Smells just like a rose
2,6-Mar-17,4,Four Stars I gave it as a gift

2,15-Jul-17,5,Five Stars Very pretty smelling.
2,25-Oct-17,5,Five Stars nice
2,16-Jan-14,1,No Scent! I have been burning my candle now for 12 hrs. It has no scent! Very disappointed! I paid 28$ for it!
2,21-Jul-17,5,Five Stars Excellent!
2,23-Jun-15,1,One Star the glass was shattered!
2,26-Jan-15,5,Five Stars Mmmmm
2,30-Nov-17,5,Five Stars NICE SENT
2,12-Nov-17,1,"BUMMER! I ordered two of these.  One was fine but the other had melted, coming out of the glass candle holder in a way that made it impossible to even see or find the wick.  I was extremely disappointed as I love Yankee Candles.  Guess I should have mailed it back but i had thrown the box away and the candle was unusable.  I hope I'm not seeing a pattern here with Amazon or Yankee Candles.  Also, one of the green Cedar and Balsam candles had somehow melted a little outside of the jar and stained my genuine Vermont Country Store oilcloth table cloth.  Yuk.  I hope you will work on improving this, Amazon.  Thanks for listening."
2,2-Apr-17,5,Five Stars It's my FAVORITE scent.
2,19-Oct-17,5,Five Stars Yankee candles are the best!
2,3-Feb-15,5,Five Stars Gift for my sister was well received and I'm told smelt lovely
2,8-Oct-14,1,"Arrived SHATTERED. This arrived in 10,000 pieces. I will not even open the box because it will likely explode shards of glass all over me and my house. Really, really not okay with how this was handled. It's going back in the thousand pieces it came in with extra tape to ensure the shards don't poke through the box."
2,15-Nov-16,1,Wrong scent sent I ordered the pink sands candle and received the French vanilla candle. Still smells good but not what I ordered.
2,1-Sep-16,1,"Incorrect scent. Was incorrect scent... I received black cherry, not pink sands. I would return, but I needed this candle for a gift I am giving in 2 days."
2,13-Jan-18,2,"Received WRONG SIZE! I ordered several of these candles in August.  I was too busy caring for my terminally ill father and put the unopened box on a shelf.  I opened the box to  wrap the candles as Christmas gifts and discovered they were Medium instead of the Large size!  It is really upsetting, but, I guess it's my fault for not inspecting."
2,22-Jun-16,1,Broken glass Was shattered when I received it.
2,28-May-16,1,"Worst candles ever! Do not buy!! Terrible!!!!!These candles were awful, I have had better experience with cheap ones from Walmart by far. I lit it the first time and left the room for a while, when I came back not only did it not smell like the scent but it smelled like pure candle wax. I swear I felt like I was walking in a funeral home or church. I bought two candles and I lit them at the same time in two different rooms, the same for both. Just terrible, there was nothing pleasant with these smells. I would love to ship them back even without a refund just to get the insult out of my house. I spent over $30 dollars on plain candle wax smell!!!!NEVER AGAIN!!!Buy at your own risk!"
2,12-May-16,5,Five Stars Great
2,30-Nov-19,1,"These candles should be ashamed to wear the badge & brand that their ""much better"" ancestors wore. I hate to leave bad reviews, but it's just necessary on this one. I bought the large jar of ""Pink Sands"" on sale for $10 I believe.I love the Pink Sands scent. I've been using the air fresheners in my van for the past 2 years. I love opening the car door on a hot summer day, and that sweet scent greeting my nose.Obviously, when I saw this sale, I thought it was a great deal for such a large candle.However, it was NOT.The candle has a single wick, which use to be adequate in the past with Yankee Candles. They were known for their potency and longevity. You USE to be able to light one of these babies for an hour, and at least half the house would smell delicious for 4 times as long.Not anymore.I don't know who purchased this company, or what ingredients they are skimping on, but they are just NOT THE SAME.You light the candle, and can't even smell it more than 10 inches away! Doesn't even work in a tiny bathroom. There's definitely zero longevity. The scent doesn't permeate the air and travel to the next room, or linger for hours. This candle is no better than an unscented decorative candle from the dollar tree yet costs so much more.Don't buy this is a gift. Don't buy this ever, for any reason.These candles should be ashamed to wear the badge & branding that their ""much much better"" ancestors wore."
2,18-Mar-18,5,"Another Amazing Scent from Yankee Candle! I love Yankee Candles, so I trusted them to know how to make candle called Calm and Quiet Place. This does smell calming and relaxing!  The mixture of jasmine, patchouli, and amber musk does smell calm and quiet! The gray color of the candle is a nice, rich color that goes with most any d?©cor. Yankee Candles are always made of paraffin-grade wax that melts evenly, delivering a fresh and calming scent throughout the entire life of the candle. This is a large, single-wick candle that measures 6.6"" x 4"", with a burning time of 110 to 150 hours. If you trim the natural fiber wick regularly, these candles do not smoke like some candles do. It is even boxed nicely enough to be appropriate for gift giving.I was given a free candle in exchange for an unbiased review."
2,1-May-18,4,"Very Floral...not for everyone. So, I'm not sure that I would describe the scent of this as ""A Calm & Quiet Place"" unless maybe you feel like your ""Calm & Quiet Place"" is at your grandma's house, which IS some people's  ""Calm & Quiet Place"" but...anyway...what I'm trying to say is that this is very ""perfume-y"" for me. Not that it smells bad, just very floral. The description says: ""A meditative fragrance‚Äîbalanced and centered with gentle jasmine, a whisper of patchouli and warm amber musk."" It's okay, just not my favorite. BUT...it could be your favorite...I don't know. So, in general, the candle is not a bad price for what you get. The large jar is pretty big, and should last a good long time. Packed very well. I was afraid of this glass jar being shipped and that it might crack in shipment, but it was packed so well, there was no chance of that. Well done, Yankee Candle!"
2,29-May-17,2,"I don't know what it is about this scent but something about it just seems off. I was really hoping to love this scent. I got this in the Melt Cup version, I've been using Melt Cups since they came out and I love how melting the wax cups gives off a better scent throw (in my opinion) around my home. I'm a big fan of Lavender and when I heard YC was coming out with a Honey Lavender scent I just had to get it!I don't know what it is about this scent but something about it just seems off. I tried melting this a few times, maybe the first time I just wasn't feeling it but every time after I just didn't like it. It doesn't have a very Lavender scent or a very Honey scent either! I'm not exactly sure WHAT this smells like but it certainly doesn't smell of either of those scents!Lemon Lavender by Yankee Candle is still by far my favorite scent!"
2,18-Mar-18,5,"Delicious Scents Sun-Drenched Apricot Rose smells just like the wild roses that were everywhere in the country when I was a kid, over 40 years ago.  I smell more rose when it's burning and the apricot when it's not lit.  The scent completely fills the den and the fragrance drifts into adjoining rooms but fainter.I've been burning the candle everyday for a week now and there is no soot or smoke buildup in the jar holder.  I see a little smoke when I blow the candle out but I've found that if I loosely cover the jar with tin foil, the air slowly diminishes in the jar and the flame goes out without a lot of smoke.Store brand candles are cheaper but their quality can't compare to Yankee Candles and Yankee Candles are made in the USA.The delicious scents make great gifts but I usually can't bear to part with it once I get it home.I did have one problem but I didn't deduct any stars because I was still able to use the candle and I do love the scent and the cleaner burn.The Jars are very thin and don't travel well.  The jar arrived cracked but I was not going to toss a perfectly good candle.  I removed the candle from the jar with a plastic coated mallet.  I left the candle in a deep cardboard box and made sure to cover my eyes and hands.  After a couple of taps with the mallet I was able to remove the candle and place it into a clear glass pillar candle holder.  Problem solved."
2,10-Mar-18,5,"Most People Will Be Pleased The new Yankee Candle Wildflower Blooms Large Jar Candle is a winner. Even though I have a preference for the more masculine woodland and fresh scents such as Sandalwood, I can appreciate this candle. the wildflower fragrance isn't overpowering to most people and the presentation of the candle is quite attractive. The green candle wax will fit in with most decor. I find that if I have been away for a few days and find the house a little less than fresh, this and other Yankee candles are lifesavers when guests drop by on short notice before I can clean and get everything fresh again. Not only does lighting them work well to fragrance the air but if I want a lighter fragrance, I can take the lid off and the air will take on a light fragrance. These candles burn longer than most candles with fragrance that I have purchased. Yankee Candles makes the claim that the continuous burn life of these candles is 110 to 150 hours. That is probably correct although I did have a Yankee Candle that burned over 200 hours. The lid securely keeps in the fragrance when the candle isn't in use. After it is burned out, the jar can be used in a number of decorative ways and can even securely store candy if it is first cleaned properly. I like it."
2,4-Jul-18,4,"Beautiful, lasts forever, but gives off a very faint scent This candle is lasting forever! It smells very nice, I just have one problem, the candle doesn't smell much when burning, at least not compared to all other Yankee candles I've tried. The smell it does give off is very faint, and has a clean smell to it. If I place the candle on the end table next to me I can smell it, but if I walk ten feet away, I can't, even if it's been burning for hours. It is very nice for ambiance, though. I like to light it in the evening on the end table next to me as I write. I am amazed at how much I've burnt it, yet it only has burned down halfway. It's very long lasting. I will definitely purchase Yankee candles more in the future, as I have for years, because they're so high quality. However, I won't be getting this scent again because it doesn't smell much."
2,22-Mar-18,5,"Lives Up to the Yankee Candle Name I am loving this new Yankee candle scent! It's sweet, but not at all over powering like some sweet and sugary scents. The smell is really hard to describe. It smells like some kind of treat mixed with some mild flowers.I'm not crazy about most floral scented candles. I'm not even sure this one has any floral in it.  It evokes feelings of happiness and joy. I've been burning this in the kitchen. I smell it when I enter the kitchen area, but I really don't notice it in the adjacent living room or hallway. I have lit this at least three times so far, for periods of approximately 4 hours each time. The wax level has hardly gone down at all. I will probably have to order this again when it's finished."
2,9-Mar-18,4,"sun-drenched fruit & flower In this urban dwelling we enjoy the glow and the scent of candles almost every evening, so I couldn't resist this aptly named Yankee Candle Sun-Drenched Apricot Rose jumbo candle. Right out of the package the scent was almost overwhelming ‚Äì still pleasant ‚Äì yet probably too strong for an entire evening's entertainment. As it turned out, the burning candle provided a softly gentle scent that's just right. Amazon Vine offers products from brand-new and long-established companies; Yankee Candle is one of the old-timers. I've deducted a star because the Apricot Rose glass candle container was broken upon arrival. I have no way of knowing whether or not that's a 1 in 1,000 occurrence; If it's routine, the company needs to explore better packaging, especially since neither UPS and USPS handle much of anything carefully. I understand that's the main reason for Amazon using sooooo much cardboard."
2,9-Mar-18,4,"Do You Like the Scent of Musk, Vanilla and Flowers? My daughter-in-law likes Yankee Candles.  I got this for her.  It has a pretty spring color in pastel.The scent has a musk overtone with vanilla and mix of floral.Now scent is subjective regarding taste.  I've never been a fan of musk, so I probably wouldn't buy this candle for myself.  But if you like musk and vanilla with a floral background, this may be a 5-star candle for you.We've been happy with Yankee Candles in the past.  They last a decent amount of time - this one lasts 110-115 hours says Yankee Candle.  The jar container is classic and goes with most decor.  The price seems reasonable compared to other candles.Yes, so if you like musk and vanilla, enjoy!"
2,23-Mar-19,4,"Makes me happy There is just something about this smell that makes me feel happy. It is just relaxing. It was very strong when I first got it but it's definitely mellowed out some as I've gotten used to the smell. Smells of course are very subjective but for me this is one I really like.As always, having owned dozens of jar candles and I can tell you this from experience, the drawback with these is you have to be very diligent about keeping the wick trimmed or you end up with soot on your walls/ceiling. Be sure to not ignore that caveat.So, yeah, I really like this smell and this candle is the quality you'd expect from Yankee Candle."
2,26-Jul-20,3,"Lasts forever, but doesn't smell The good: This candle lasts forever. I have been burning it nonstop for about 7-8 hours and barely any of it has melted down. It puts off a nice glow and makes my room feel cozy. The bad: I can't smell anything at all. On cold sniff, it has a little bit of a smell, but after burning for this long, I still don't smell anything. I will say, that I have had this candle for quite some time now (at least a year) so maybe that is why there is no smell."
2,5-Mar-18,4,"Sweet But Not Sugary Yankee Candles tend to be first rate when it comes to quality, so rating any individual scent is purely subjective. That being said, my wife and I really enjoy the ""Sweet Nothings"" scent. I was initially worried that they might overdo the ""sweet"" and I'd end up with the scent of cotton candy, but that's definitely not the case. There's a nice blend of fragrance notes - not too sweet or perfumey and certainly not cloying - and the overall scent is very pleasant but quite light (perhaps the ""nothing"" in the name?). Let me be clear - the scent spreads across a lot of space (and made our kitchen smell nice after a full morning of cooking), but it's a light scent.Your nose and mileage may vary, but we really like ""Sweet Nothings."""
2,22-Mar-18,5,"Long-Burning, Great Fragrance Candle I love Yankee Candles! I have been using them for years. They are the best when it comes to clean scents, long burns, and scent diffusion.The new scent, ""A Calm and Quiet Place"" is a candle that I think about for rainy days curled up with a book. It smells on the sweeter side, and reminds me of baby powder, lavender, and slight overtones of ocean (sandalwood, maybe?). To catch the best scent, smell the lid of the jar and not the jar itself.The candle is in a durable glass jar, that can be reused for crafts, storing pens and pencils, and holding things like buttons. I like that the jar is glass and can be recycled if you do not have a repurpose for it."
2,13-Apr-18,5,"I love candles of all kinds I love candles of all kinds, from unscened tea lights to large 3 wick 6"" candles.  I am partial scented candles, though.  I just love the ambiance of lighting the candle and enjoying a pleasant scent.  My favorite scents are usually beachy smelling ones, whether it is a tropical bloom like a plumeria, or coconutty sun tanning lotion.Yankee candles are expensive, but they burn so nicely without waste, that you really do get your money's worth.  This scent is perfect for people who like gentle and calming scents.  It is very subtle and in the background, giving a bit of atmosphere to the room, without being overcloying."
2,8-Oct-19,3,"Great smelling but burns poorly Great smelling candle but pricey & poor burning. Candles don't burn evenly  & at about the 1/2 way point it is no longer burn able because the wick is not sized correct to burn as it should.  They say 120 - 150 hour burn time, more like 20 - 30 hour burn time. Conclusion, Not worth the cost."
2,12-Mar-18,5,"Smells like a floral woman's perfume.  Very strong, wafting scent. I wasn't sure about this when I just lifted off the lid and smelled it; I was a little overpowered by the gardenias in the fragrance blend of this. It smells a lot like a flowery perfume.  However, using it delivers a somewhat gentler perfumey scent, and quickly.  I lit the candle and literally within minutes I could smell it all the way across the downstairs.  I've never used a Yankee Candle, but I can see why they are popular. The scent is dramatically strong, and much better at infusing through the house than other methods of home-scenting that I've tried (like aromatherapy misters and cheaper scented candles)."
2,21-Mar-18,5,"Relaxing Yankee Candle is probably my favorite candle manufacturer. The scents the candles produce are light and refreshing. Some candles have heavy fake smells and others just have a bad smell. The Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle Calm and Quiet Place is another great candle by Yankee Candle. The scent is calming which is surprised me because I wasn't sure what ""calm and quiet"" would smell like. The  effect was very pleasant.I recommend the Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle Calm and Quiet Place to anyone who enjoys Yankee Candles. It would also be a great gift for someone. Try it, you will enjoy it."
2,10-Mar-18,5,"soft, pretty scent This candle smells so nice. I see other reviews saying it has a musk scent but I don‚Äôt get that at all. To me it smells like a soft floral mix. It‚Äôs one of those scents that‚Äôs nice to have in the background. It‚Äôs not overpowering or something people can quickly identify.The large jar style yankee candles are a favorite of mine. They last a long time as long as I‚Äôm careful to allow them to stay even. If it‚Äôs not lit long enough the wax will wear down in the center. Just a bit and it‚Äôs fixable by cutting away the wax around the edge before lighting it again but too much and it won‚Äôt be usable as long as it should have been."
2,24-Feb-20,1,"Strange sulfur smell I‚Äôve bought Pink Sands from the Yankee Candle store before, so I didn‚Äôt expect any issues ordering it online.There is something wrong with these candles. There is a distinct sulfur smell that gets more pronounced the longer it burns. I thought just one of the candles might have been defective, but nope. It was both of them.So disappointed!"
2,31-Jan-20,5,"LOVE the Scent! I am not a big candle person.  I rarely buy candles or even like the smell of most of them.  But this one, the Pink Sands by Yankee Candle, I like a lot.  It has a nice sweet and sugary feminine scent, but not too overpowering.(btw, I bought the gel beads version of Pink Sands by Yankee Candle, that one stinks and smell nothing like this one!)"
2,19-Jul-19,5,"Arrived in perfect condition. Great candle, fantastic scent This arrived perfect, NOT broken as some reviews have indicated. It was packaged very well. Using a cardboard insert to cushion the candle, it was placed inside a snug fitting box which was then nested inside a larger one. It seemed to offer a great deal of protection.The candle itself burns well and has a great scent, that in my opinion, is not ""perfumy"" or overpowering."
2,19-Mar-18,5,"This single-wick candle will have a long and happy life at our place. The moment I opened the box and showed my wife what was inside the box from Amazon, she burst into a big smile, opened the lid took a deep breath and left it sitting out on the end of the bar in our kitchen.  The aroma is pleasing and works well either lit or not.Yankee candles have a reputation for burning well and this one has a great fragrance.  We lit it yesterday for the first time and we were not disappointed.  It burns slowly and evenly.This single-wick candle will have a long and happy life at our place."
2,6-Apr-18,5,"Unique and Inviting Scent I love this scent. While not a food type of scent, it still gives off a warm and cozy fragrance. The scent is not overwhelming or cloy yet it does cover a large area. It's not overly floral or perfume-like but has a warm, relaxing smell. It's hard to really describe the smell. The candle burns nicely without a lot of smoke. I like that it has a lid since it makes it easier to put the candle flame out. Just place the lid on. I like that the scent is unique and is something my whole family can agree that we like."
2,3-Mar-18,4,"New scent of Wildflower has a subtle aroma I like Yankee Candle and the products they offer. This is the classic large jar with a new scent, Wildflower Blooms. It is a very subtle scent, and does not fill a room like some of the stronger scents do. But its soft and gives a faint spring smell to your room. Burn time is about 110-150 hours, so it would give you somewhere between 5 and 7 days of continuous burning, to give you an idea. And those are probably good estimates. I have a few of their other products, but typically I like the classic jar candle."
2,11-Mar-18,5,"Quality long lasting candle. Like the scent. Large high-quality candle in a sturdy jar.Likes:-  Quality wax and wick.- Aroma. Smells good, floral undertones but not overly sweet. Aroma is not too strong IMO.- Sturdy jar with nice cap that seals.- Large size. Lasts longer.  You'll get many nice evenings out of this candle.Dislikes:- None.Other thoughts;- Keep the wick trimmed, erring on the side of a short wick, as small as 1/4"" long."
2,4-Mar-18,5,"High Quality Yankee Candle Great Sent. First I must say that I received this Yankee Candle Large Jar Candle, Wildflower Blooms free as part of amazon's Vine program witch is designed to generate reviews of new products. Yankee Candle makes quality products and this is no exception.  Yankee candle's tend to last for a long time (long slow burn).  Its a really nice sent and helps set off a nice ambiance in your home. This would also make a great gift for all kinds of occasions. I can highly recommend."
2,26-Mar-18,4,"Beautiful candle, awful fragrance Beautiful candle, awful fragrance. I do not care for the 'Sweet Nothings' fragrance it is very flowery, definitely sweet, and overpowering like a bad perfume. The candle itself is very nice, soft lavender color and comes in a fancy glass jar with a lid. The candle is quite large and will last several weeks, depending on how often you use it. Overall a lovely candle, but the fragrance was too much for me and gave me a headache."
2,5-Feb-19,5,"A-M-A-Z-I-N-G I love it, I love it, I love it! It is a very unisex scent and both my husband and I enjoy it burning. It arrived quickly, in perfect shape, and packed very well. No wonder this one is always out of stock. Buy it if you get a chance!"
2,5-Mar-18,5,"Lovely springtime scented candle The scent of this Yankee Candle ""Wildflower"" infused my home with Spring. It is just lovely. I have never had a Yankee Candle before and it is really an additional pleasure in my life. I have two cats and two cat boxes and although I strive to keep everything clean, the Wildflower scent enhanced the ambiance of my house."
2,31-Dec-14,5,"Pink Sands This smells NOTHING like sand, but I don't think sand has a distinguishable scent, so I'm pretty positive that the chemists at Yankee Candle used their imagination with this one. This is a WONDERFUL scent. Yankee Candle claims that this scent is a blend of floral, citrus, and vanilla, but I cannot sense any of those three components in the candle at all. It smells more to me like a typical ""ocean breeze"" scent combined with cotton candy. Call me crazy or just overly creative, but this is exactly what it smells like in my opinion. It's very beachy, yet very sweet at the same time. Perfect for summer! It's also very calming and relaxing."
2,18-Dec-19,5,"Surprisingly lovely summer scent Loved this one. Smells like grapefruit, the beach, and a pina colada. Very light and crisp and clean, perfect for summertime. Makes me think of the beach. Sweet smelling without being overpowering. Was pleasantly surprised."
2,5-Sep-16,5,"Smells Very Similar to Old Yankee Candle Favorite ""Hearts and Flowers"" My new favorite Yankee scent.  I tend to like fresh and floral scents.  I would describe this a little more on the floral end of the spectrum.  If you remember and loved ""Hearts and Flowers"" you will like this fragrance.  I have one very old Hearts and Flowers (discontinued) candle and the fragrances are almost identical."
2,8-Dec-15,5,"Wonderful Scent If you like lilacs, then this is the candle for you.  The scent, when burning gives the room a subtle scent of lilac blossoms, which normally I can only enjoy for an ever so brief time in the spring.  The branches, when picked, wilt all too quickly and the scent fades, but this candle means you can enjoy the scent again and again...even in the dead of winter.The candle comes in a nice, heavy glass jar.  This makes a great gift for those who adore the smell of lilacs."
2,11-Mar-18,5,"Sweet Floral Scent, But Not Overpowering... I love this candle! Yankee does such a great job with their candles. This particular one has a faint lilac/lavender scent to it. It's sweet, but not overpowering.I have this burning on my kitchen island most days, and it fills the kitchen/dinning room area with a subtle floral scent. Very pleased with this candle...would absolutely recommend it!"
2,2-Jun-20,5,Like walking in a garden I absolutely love this jasmine candle I bought! It smells fantastic and can be lit for a nice hour or so while I'm in the bath without overpowering the room. 10/10
2,16-Jun-18,5,"It's not overly perfumey but has a nice sweet scent that lingers for a while even after ... This candle is huge and the scent is really refreshing. It's not overly perfumey but has a nice sweet scent that lingers for a while even after the candle has been blown out. It's large size will guarantee a long, slow burn, the purple color is really pretty as well. Would make an excellent gift. Highly recommend"
2,27-Jul-20,5,Like sitting next to a fresh lilac bush. Yankee candles are my favorite ever.  They burn evenly all the way to the bottom.  Scents are authentic and throw is good.
2,30-Oct-18,4,"Love the candle, not the smell I've always loved Yankee Candles. They are high quality, long lasting, great smelling candles. I gave this one only 4 stars b/c I didn't care for the smell. It was just ok to me, but smell is very subjective. Overall, I feel you can never really go wrong with Yankee."
2,7-Mar-18,5,"Another quality scent from Yankee Candle. Yankee candles are always quality products, with the solid, elegant looking jar and a variety of wonderful scents.  This candle is no different; fills a room with a light wonderful scent without overpowering the occupants.  Smells like a very light mixture of vanilla and lavender; very pretty and relaxing."
2,12-Mar-18,1,"Disappointing I normally love Yankee Candle Company Products, so I eagerly looked forward to this one.Egad!It smells like the type of deodorant they placed in the ladies' room of cheap restaurants years ago. It has a chemical, bug killer smell, unpleasant and strong/I am not sure what to do with it."
2,19-May-17,5,And I was very happy with the service from Amazon My mom was thrilled with this candle.  And I was very happy with the service from Amazon.  They let me know that her item couldn't be delivered as wanted but that was my fault.  I didn't remember she was going out of town.  So it was delivered to the post office and she picked it up Wednesday and they let me know she picked it up.
2,11-Mar-18,3,"Disappointing I haven't burned candles in a long time, but I always bought Yankee. This one smells divine in the jar. I burned it for an hour yesterday and it burns fairly cleanly, but when burning I really didn't smell the scent much. Kind of disappointing for a candle that costs 30.00."
2,3-Jan-19,5,"To the reviewer who claims she got ripped off. Both 22oz tumbler and jar are essentially the same weight. As you can see in the pictures, the jar is wider and shorter, the tumbler is slightly thinner but taller. Hope this calms you down a bit."
2,26-May-20,4,Price is extremely high Midnight Jasmine is my all time favorite by Yankee Candles....but you can find them at many place for half this price....including Walmart.
2,30-Oct-19,5,My favorite candle Makes my livingroom and kitchen smell great. Strong enough to notice but not over powering so I use it during parties.
2,21-May-18,5,"Lovely, relaxing scent! Sometimes a candle smell can overwhelm or be offensive to some. This slow burning candle has a very subtle but lovely scent that I found very relaxing.  As all Yankee Candles, it is of the highest quality. I plan to order more!"
2,19-Aug-20,1,Broken. Came broken.  No I have to go through the process of getting it replaced.  Such a headache.
2,12-Sep-20,5,Candle Just the right size and the best scent
2,20-Jul-19,5,Smells so good! I‚Äôve always loved yankee candle. Super glad I got this! Affordable and lasts much longer than other brands.
2,15-Feb-17,5,"Smells Amazing, like Baby Powder and Light Floral The Wedding Day smell is by far my favorite out of anything Yankee sells. I got it as a present at my bridal shower and have loved it ever since. It isn't overpowering yet you can still smell it in the room when lit. It smells like a combination of baby powder and light floral scents, a little like roses and peonies."
2,27-Dec-15,1,"Hit or miss products with bad customer service. I will never purchase from Yankee Candle again. They do not stand behind their products. I spend $27.99 on a the large Pink Sands candle that does not smell. They told me it's because I've adjusted to the scent. Yet I have the same scent and my car and have no problem smelling it. I emailed them the same day I purchased the candle and here is the response I got. With so many other great candlemakers available with better and strong scents, there is no reason for me to ever deal with Yankee again.Email response from Yankee:Thank you for being a valued Yankee Candle¬Æ guest and taking the time to contact us.""What you are asking is really an age-old question relating to the science of smelling and the art of fragrance. The answer is not really in the percent of fragrance that is in a candle, because we use as much fragrance oil as we can to make the scent smell as true-to-life as possible while delivering a candle that will burn properly from the moment you light it until the end. The answer is multi-faceted.There are some scents that are just naturally stronger than others (think of a bouquet of flowers, chances are the lily will be the scent you smell above all others). Sometimes there is a scent that is more difficult for one person to smell while others smell it very strongly (cinnamon is a perfect example of this). Regardless of the strength of the fragrance, our bodies will become accustomed to something we smell regularly and we will no longer detect it (think of your own cologne or even shampoo that you don‚Äôt really smell on you but others can). And, lastly, other environmental factors will impact the strength of the scent ‚Äì the size of the room, other odors present, air flow, temperature, etc. The good news is that we listen to all of you and we continually make improvements to our products so that we will always strive to deliver the kind of fragrance you want!"""
2,16-Nov-20,5,Lasts a very long time My absolute favorite scent. Price was perfect.
2,20-Apr-18,5,Lovely scent and color... We like this scent and I think it is helping us wind down after a day of running to sport's practices. I will be considering this one as a teacher's gift in the future.  Just looking at this candle makes me calmer!
2,26-Feb-19,5,Great gift I sent this as a gift to a sick friend. She loved it and said it smelled wonderful.  I was delighted at how fast it arrived at her home.
2,16-Dec-18,5,"Yankee candle never disappoints Very good quality. Strong smell but not overpowering , very light and fresh."
2,22-Sep-19,5,"Agradable aroma ambiental Realmente buena, suele ser un item no muy barato, per vale su precio, el aroma ambiental es agradable, aunque no se enciende diariamente, se nota que tiende a ser de larga duracion."
2,14-Apr-19,5,Very good scent My favorite scent for all time! The smell when it melts is just relaxing delivers me to hang out in Malibu!
2,15-Jan-20,1,"Candle Lilac Blossoms Scent not too good, I can't hardly smell it."
2,16-Jan-18,4,I quite like it as it can run for ~150 hrs My flatmate found this for free somewhere and I have been using it for some days. I quite like it as it can run for ~150 hrs. But on the other hand the smell isn't very noticeable. Well its free so not that I can complain much.
2,10-Apr-18,5,Finally?üòç?üòç?üòç Finally I found a candle that strong and strength but not overpowering. This candle literally smells like roses. I definitely recommend this candle to any candle lovers and I will be purchasing again‚ô•Ô?è
2,14-Jul-19,1,Broken glass Sent this as a gift for my mom for mother's day.  It was completely shattered when she opened it. Very disappointed.
2,20-Aug-19,5,Lilac smell great This is my favorite candle to give as a gift or to keep for yourself
2,26-Jul-19,5,Disappointed not much lilac scent. Burning the candle for over an hour & there is very little lilac scent.
2,5-Dec-19,5,Great aroma Perfect scent! Smells like fresh lilacs
2,23-Jul-19,3,Its okay I was expecting better after hearing great things about this brand
2,18-Mar-15,5,This is one of my favorite scents! I fell in love with it at ... This is one of my favorite scents! I fell in love with it at the Yankee Candle store in Massachusetts! It's A Fresh Springy smell. To a review before they do make a fresh cut grass scent that really does smell of sweet cut grass. It's also I really good scent. But this scent has more of a soft fragrance it's very calming and fresh.
2,3-Jun-18,1,"Not much scent here Sweet Nothings is a good name for this candle, as there seems to be no scent when it is burning. Pretty jar, but just don't expect much of an aroma.."
2,1-Jun-11,5,"a claming fragrance I think ALL Yankee candles are the best candles you can buy. The lilac blossom candle has a calming, beautiful, beginning of spring scent. After a long day there's nothing better than coming home, kicking off your shoes and getting comfortable in a room that has an invigorating relaxing scent of lilacs. Unlike most candles where there is either no scent at all or the scent is very minamal, all Yankee candles have a scent that fills the rooms and lasts a long time. The only problem with Yankee candles is that they are on the pricey side but they are worth the money. It's hard to find candles were the scent lasts throughout the entire time the candle is lit and the scents are so calming."
2,3-Jun-18,5,Smells amazing Love Yankee Candles and this one smells very clean and good.  Yankee candles burn clean and leave no smoke or marks on walls. Love them.
2,22-Jun-18,5,"Great scent, great packaging. Sent as a gift. The recipient said they arrived in perfect condition, wrapped in egg crate padding, and that they smell amazing."
2,22-Sep-18,3,"I expect more from YC The candle is okay, but the smell is non descript and doesn‚Äôt do much. I expect more from Yankee Candle."
2,23-Nov-19,1,No smell Had to return because I could not smell anything.
2,26-Jun-18,5,This would also make a nice gift. The large yankee candles burn for a long time.  This scent is light enough to not be overpowering.  This would also make a nice gift.
2,3-Aug-19,4,Nice scent Not a super strong smell but it smells good.
2,7-Jul-12,2,"Great scent but weak wick I love the scent of this candle but not the wick.Somehow, Yankee Candle's wicks are becoming weak.  As a result, the flame was very small, generating insufficient heat.  After burning my candle for two hours, the wax pool is still making its way to the glass jar.  As a result, some wax never gets to release the fragrance it contains.  I would estimate a loss of 50% of the candle that could not be burned because of the weak wick. I experienced the same issue with several of Yankee candles over the past 5 years.  This phenomenon seems to be random.  I wonder if there is a batch to batch variation with the wicks that Yankee Candle sources from its suppliers.  It's a serious quality issue that Yankee should address.In summary, I love the scent but am very disappointed with the quality of the candle."
2,15-Sep-19,5,Smells like the real thing!! Never a bad choice!!?üòÅ
2,23-Jan-17,5,Yankee Candles are the best I love Yankee candles. I've tried several brands and these don't have that waxy smell to them when you burn them. Lilac Blossom is probably my favorite scent. They might cost a little more but to me it's worth it.
2,10-May-19,1,gift card not attached again very disappointed no gift card
2,12-Apr-19,5,Too expensive to buy I love the scents and yankee candles but too expensive
2,21-Dec-12,5,"LOVE I love this scent.  It's the only scent I've ever purchased in candles, sprays, car fresheners, etc...  The plug ins are quite good too.  This scent is so nice.  It's a clean, sweet, almost sugary scent.  I don't find it particularly beachy, but maybe it smells like a tropical flower or a fun beach drink.  :-)"
2,18-Aug-19,5,Love this scent Live YC!
2,6-Oct-13,5,"Pure, Innocent and Beautiful! This is white floral. I think this is one of the most peaceful gorgeous scent on the market from any candle maker. It does bring to mind all things from your wedding day. I'm by no means a newly wed but I'll be buying this for years to come. I can't think of another scent to compare it to. It's very unique."
2,30-Aug-19,5,Great value Great burn time and scent is sting but nice.
2,21-Jul-19,5,Love It One of my favorite summer scents

2,10-May-17,1,"Yikes....costs more Does not make sense...if you order the group of 6, the candle costs $28.33 which is more than buying a single jar....what gives?"
2,15-May-18,5,This is one of my favorite candles. I love the smell it was hard ... This is one of my favorite candles. I love the smell it was hard to give as a gift but I did and got a candle like this back as a gift.
2,12-Feb-18,5,"Good scent Smells yummy and fresh.Not heavy perfume smell, it smells like roses"
2,2-Apr-16,5,"Favorite scent! I love all of Yankee candle's so when I found this one, I was very excited! It smells like literally fresh roses. I couldn't believe how spot in this scent is!"

2,15-Mar-16,5,"Perfect Gift for a Flower Obsessed Mom I bought this for my mom for Christmas and she loves it. I was worried that it would be a grandma smell, but it wasn't, it's a lovely fresh scent."
2,17-Jul-15,5,"This candle actually captures the lilac scent. It's as ... This candle actually captures the lilac scent. It's as if the lilacs were growing within your home. Yankee candles, sometimes hard to find, are well worth the money spent."
2,4-Dec-17,5,Incredible scent This is by far my favorite jasmine-scented candle.
2,5-Jan-15,5,"The best scented candle ! My dad ordered this for me and i was in love before i even got it ! I am obsessed with the pink sands candle it is by far the most amazing scent ive ever smelled ! I have the car air freshners, tea light candles, room spray and now the large candle ! 10 out of 10 would so recommend !!!"
2,22-Jul-18,1,Very Disappointed! Absolutely NO smell!
2,5-Sep-17,5,Made a good gift for a candle lover. Made a good gift for a candle lover.
2,13-May-12,4,"Watermellon Jolly Ranchers! This smells like watermelon hard candy with light floral undertones. This is nice, light and girly. I think they should call it pink sugar instead because it is very young and sweet."
2,24-Jan-20,5,Great gift Great gift for the holidays
2,10-Jun-15,1,No Scent This is the FIRST Yankee candle that I can't smell. Some of the reviews said it was a light scent but there is a major difference between light & non existent!!! Very disappointed in this candle!
2,17-Jul-19,1,Walking on broken glass This candle smells great- However it was completely shattered when I received it.
2,27-Jan-16,5,Great scent for bath time Exactly what you would expect or find in the store.  Great scent for bath time :)

2,5-Apr-13,5,YUUUUMYYY! I love the smell of this candle. Its soft yet lasts and smells so good I want to eat it. Sweet with a little citrus twist. Just the right combo.
2,8-Jan-15,4,"I love the smell of this candle I love the smell of this candle! It is my favorite. Unfortunately, I got this one with a completely shattered jar. I am not returning it because I do a lot of business on Amazon and it will be a hassle, but I was disspointed in the shotty wrapping job on a glass item. =("
2,26-Mar-11,4,"Very Pretty This is a soft lovely spring scent. It is not strong yet gives off a lovely scent of relaxation, springtime.. I reccomend this"
2,27-Oct-16,2,Two Stars not very fragrant
2,26-Aug-14,5,This is my favorite smell ever This is my favorite smell ever! I love the 2-wick systems (seems to burn better). Can walk in the house and smell my candle in any room. Love Yankee Candles! Burn well and Smell like they are supposed to.
2,16-Feb-15,5,Great gift for the parents Mother loved it for her bday gift. Dad liked it as well
2,19-Oct-14,5,Great candle. This will magically turn your house into rose garden!
2,7-Mar-18,5,Great fragrance with wonderful aroma in nice glass jar. Amazing fragrance that is so fresh; wonderful aroma.  Nice beautiful jar.Substantial product that will last a long time.

2,9-Jan-07,5,"Quick delivery Thanks for the quick shipment - exactly what I needed.  Thanks for the wrapping paper, too."
3,25-Jan-18,2,The Meyers as a company is really good at tricking people when it comes to product sizes The Meyers as a company is really good at tricking people when it comes to product sizes. These candles are small and smell just okay. Not worth the price tag.
3,31-Oct-18,2,"Not so great. I bought the 2 set of lavender candles. They smell like the brand‚Äôs own version of lavender. If you have used any of their other lavender products, you‚Äôll know exactly what I mean. Does it smell like my organic lavender essential oils? Not one bit. Does it smell like it does when I visit the lavender farm? Not one bit. Is this a horrible sent? No. Will I order this scent again? Probably not. They also aren‚Äôt strong and you‚Äôd never know one was lit."
3,23-May-17,5,"I'm addicted to Mrs. Meyers lavender scented candle! Mrs. Meyers clean day lavender candle scented at a 35 hour burn time is my absolute favorite all-time candle! Period. The smell is absolutely delicious it makes your entire house smell good just one candle.I have quite an addiction to Good Sense and I've used everything from Bed Bath & Beyond, Bath & Body Works and and Yankee Candle Company candles and waxes. Once you try Mrs. Meyers, there's no turning back. It's the absolute best scent (lavender) and smells the house up incredibly fast and wonderfully yum!"
3,17-Oct-17,5,"Smells good and burns evenly I first found these candles as a more affordable alternative to other lavender soy candles. Since then, I've gotten a new one every 2-3 months and continue to be pleased with them. Some reviews note that they don't smell like lavender, but I contest that they do - they don't smell any different from the lavender essential oil that I have. The scent is as strong from when you first burn the candle to the very end. I also find that it burns evenly instead of tunneling into the wax like cheaper candles. When the candles are done, I take the metal wick holder out of the jar, stick it in a microwave to melt the wax, pour it out, and reuse the jar. I'll probably get these candles for years to come."
3,29-Dec-17,1,"Great scent, but don't burn throughout so a waste of a purchase Always love this product. However, they never burn fully,and the bottom is always still remaining with no opportunity to fully use the expensive candle purchase. Significant product flaw."
3,18-May-20,3,"Doesn‚Äôt burn 35hr, nor able to finish candle due to short string. This candle burns clean, and smells nothing short of amazing clean lavender! That being said, I gave this product a 3 star rating because it did it not last long ( only had this candle for about 2.5 weeks) and it‚Äôs done! In fact, I should‚Äôve been able to get about 35 hrs I‚Äôd burn time as it states. Now, within the 2.5 week period, I didn‚Äôt use it every day but would usually burn for about 30mins-1hr after I‚Äôve finished cleaning up. Nonetheless, it did not cover the guarantee of 35hr burn time. Another issue is once the candle got down to the bottom, it will not relight to finish a good portion of the wax still left. I‚Äôve included pictures to show. The amount left is probably just what I need to finish up my 35 hr burn period as this much wax left should still last me about another 1week or so. This is highly upsetting for the cost of these small bottles. They need to figure out a way to maximize the string to finish burning more than enough of the wax left behind.  I‚Äôve had much cheaper candles from brand stores ?üéØ that could do the job! Even though I‚Äôm in love with the scent, you simply don‚Äôt get what you are paying for with this brand of candle, and well that‚Äôs highly important to me!"
3,18-Oct-17,2,"Wastes too much wax - wick not effective I love Mrs Myers scents & products but the candles (in glass) simply waste too much wax. Each time, I end up wasting nearly a quarter of the candle wax because the wick doesn't burn down far enough. I don't have time/interest in trying to melt the wax & adding to another candle. I haven't had the same issue w/Mrs Myers tin candles (pine) but that doesn't seem to be a purchase option for Subscribe & Save market. Bummer"
3,16-Jan-18,1,"Candles wick Read a large majority of reviews on this product of candles from Mrs. Meyers and have used two of these candles myself. The candles wick does not last whatsoever, therefore wasting a good 40% of the candles wax, and personally not worth purchasing."
3,28-Aug-19,5,Smells great! Just Return if glass jar breaks during shipping. I bought these candles because I was looking for a candle that would last a long time (which makes it worth the price!) and smell great. I got the lavender and I really love it. I keep one in the bathroom and one in my living room. When they arrived one of the candle's glass jar was cracked (like many other reviewers mentioned) but I returned it and amazon sent me a replacement which was fine. I do think that the packaging can be improved to reduce the chance of breaking during shipping but returning it wasn't a problem for me.
3,15-Feb-17,2,"Mrs Meyers usually rocks, but her lavender candle needs to be put to sleep. I am a lover of candles and of Mrs. Meyers products, but this product has a very nasty odor.  The glass jar and lid are wonderful and the fact it is may by soy leaves less smoke when burning, but lavender just does not smell like this.  Many cheap candles like apple, cookies, perfumes if made cheaply smell bad and this scent just is toxic."
3,6-Jun-18,1,One came broken. The product packaging (not amazon's) was ... One came broken.  The product packaging (not amazon's) was incredibly light on padding.  The wick on the other fell apart cutting the life of the candle in half.  We bought these with the thought that the Soy would last longer.  They don't.
3,29-Jul-20,4,"Nice, light scent This candle is perfect for those who like a soft, but fresh scent that is not overpowering. The candle burns very clean, and burns pretty long, for the money. A good value. Typical of all Mrs. Meyers products, not completely organic, but ingredients are more natural than most, and quite effective. All their packaging is easy to recycle/reuse. Amazon packaging, on the other hand, still has some improving to do. So much overpackaging, but still doesn't avoid an awful lot of leakage and breakage.  This product, on the other hand, was packaged just right. 2 candles packed together in a small box with just enough cushion. Not wasteful or overdone, but effective. Order in 2s, or 4s to save on shipping, and set up on auto delivery for every month or so to keep your house smelling fresh, fresh, fresh."
3,26-Jul-17,1,Scent was a no-go The scent was just not my cup of tea. It was unbearable. And I'm a big lavender fan so I can offer no explanation.
3,3-May-18,3,"The wick burns down much too early... I really like that smell of this candle but the wick burns down long before the candle, which is a complete waste. I have candle warmers to place them on, but again there is like one inch of candle wax left and to me that is a bit disappointing."
3,11-Mar-19,3,"Something has changed I used to love these candles, I hadn't bought them for years and then came across them again recently and remembered how much I liked them. Either my sense of smell has changed in those years or they changed the ingredients in this candle because I noticed a very strong Lemony smell to it that I really did not enjoy. It's definitely a personal preference, if you like lemon and lavender then you'll probably like this, I ended up giving them to my friend and she loves them."
3,5-Sep-20,5,"My fave Wish the packaging was a little fancier, but it's their basic branding. But this is the candle I keep in stock and backstocked because I turn to it again and again. Fresh, delicious lavender with citrus. Light and delicious. I use it almost every day. Affordable pricing/packaging. I'm picky about my lavenders and I've rarely found a potent variety. Mrs. Meyers has scored with the lavender scent-potency. And, it's natural. Win!"
3,10-Nov-18,4,"There is no right answer on smell I was pretty nervous about buying these because of all of the conflicting reviews about whether or not they actually smell like lavender but I think I've figured out why no one can agree.  It's because each candle smells different.  I bought a two pack and they smell different even though they're both the same thing.  They're definitely both very strong and very floral but neither is truly lavender.  One is more lavender-esque than the other though.  Very strange.  At least they're pleasantly floral and not fake, over-perfumey or headache-enducing."
3,17-Jan-19,2,"Won't buy again. I love Mrs Meyer's products but these candles were disappointing. I bought the two pack and noticed with the first candle that there was a LOT of wax left in the bottom when the wick had burned out. I hoped it was a fluke but the second candle was the same way, the wick doesn't go anywhere near the bottom of the jar so the candle burns out when there is still an inch of wax left. It felt like a waste to throw away all of that wax, especially since like most Mrs Meyer's products they aren't cheap. I was willing to pay for my favorite scent but I won't be buying these again. Rip off!"
3,17-Apr-19,5,"Nice product From what I have experienced with the Mrs. Meyers scented candle, the lavender scent is the most desirable.  What I like about the product is that it is comprised of soy.  When it gets low and is no longer useable, I melt the rest of the candle in very warm water, remove the wick, pour into a mold, refrigerate until firm, remove from mold and use as a drawer sachet.  One can definitely smell it upon entrance to a room.  I'm sure the glass container can be recycled/reused but don't think I would use for food storage."
3,3-Apr-17,5,Soy candles are the way to go.... This is my first time ever using soy based candles. I won't ever go back to the traditional paraffin type candles. The burn time on these candles is pretty amazing considering their size. I really enjoyed the delicate scent; not at all overpowering like some candles - but no doubt the fragrance glides throughout the house.  They burn very delicately (they don't burn hot and don't smoke).
3,28-Jan-19,3,"Only OK I'm not a reviewer but thought i'd share, I want to start off by saying the candle smells good but not what i would consider a lavander. It is too ""sweet""  in my opinion. I can only compare it to other lavander candles i have tried. It permeates fine for its candle size but is just too sweet smelling for me, again not a bad smell just not what i was expecting. I prefer the Burts Bees Lavender fields it doesn't smell so sweet. I used to live near a few lavander fields and its as close as y ou get in a candle (the fields are amazing). I'm not payed and have no recieved anything as of this review from wither company, that said i will try meyers other candles to see what i like. I just prefer clean sents like fresh linen, cotton or for me lavander with no sweetness to them."
3,22-May-20,2,"Burns out very quickly with a lot of wax left These have a strong smell that can add fragrance to a whole room! I was pleased that the candles smell ""the same"" as other Mrs. Meyers products (the lavender dish soap, everyday cleaning spray, laundry detergent, etc). I really like the mason jar packaging as well. However, upon using these I realized they burn out very quickly with a lot of wax left in the bottom of the jar. I ordered a 2 pack and it happened to both candles. What a waste of wax! Turns out this product is just poorly made/inefficient‚Äîespecially for the price."
3,11-Sep-20,5,"Great buy - burns forever Love these. I‚Äôve always loved Meyer‚Äôs cleaning products and was hesitant to buy their candles cause I didn‚Äôt want to burn something that smells like a window cleaner but they‚Äôre great. The scent was a little sweeter than Basil so not totally accurate on the name but still loved it - strong but not an obnoxious smell. If you‚Äôre on the fence due to price for somewhat small candles, keep in mind that they burn super slowly and last a long time. We‚Äôve lit one of our candles several times for multiple hours and you can barely even notice any wax missing."
3,25-May-18,1,Broken Both candles were smashed to pieces. Currently nursing a bloody finger without the pleasant scent of basil.
3,19-Feb-20,2,"Wicked bad scent! Wow, I cannot express how awful this ""lavender"" scent is.  It is absolutely intolerable, even for a few minutes.  My husband has a very weak sense of smell, but even he can't bear the chemical odor of this candle.  Two stars instead of one because it is a reasonable quality soy candle, and if you're using it in the bathroom, it *will* do the trick:  you'll instantly overrule the ""bathroom"" smell with the stench of toxic waste lavender!"
3,24-Jun-19,5,Lots of Scent I purchase the Mrs Meyers lavender candle as a Subscribe & Save item every month.  I like the aroma and there‚Äôs a lot of it.  You can smell the lavender even when the candle is not burning if the lid is off.  I think the candle burns really cleanly and pretty completely (about the same as most candles).  It is not a huge candle but you can definitely smell it when it is burning.
3,25-Dec-19,3,"Interesting purchase I've used Mrs. Meyer's cleaning supplies for a while, and though it would be interesting to try the candles. I'm somewhat disappointed though. Compared to Bath & Bodyworks candles I usually buy, this one doesn't ""fill my house with scent"", but just the immediately area the candle sits. Still smells great, just not what I had hoped it would be. Since Mrs. Meyer's cleaning supplies are rather strong, I had an expectation of something different."
3,26-Mar-17,5,I love the lavender version of Mrs I love the lavender version of Mrs. Meyers candles.  They provide a lovely scent and have a reasonable life span.  I typically burn the candles for several hours on week nights and weekend.  One candle typically last 3-4 weeks for me at this rate.  The price is reasonable given the quality of the product.
3,13-May-20,3,"Nice scent, but low throw. I've been using the Mrs. Meyer's Basil Multi-Surface Spray Cleaner for some time and I absolutely LOVE the scent! When I came across these candles I thought they would be the perfect addition to my home, to continue that amazing smell after I clean.Out of the box, they seemed promising and smelled exactly like the fresh scent of the cleaner. I was a little disappointed with how little the scent throws after the candle is lit. I thought maybe the room was too large where I had them lit, so I tested it in my bathroom... Still resulting in very little scent in the room. You have to be within a foot of the candle to actually smell it while it's burning but it does seem to have a long burn time. Overall, I would not purchase again since the whole concept of a scented candle is to make your home smell good which these did not provide well enough."
3,20-Jul-20,3,"both candles wouldn't stay lit - flames kept going out I LOVE the smell of these candles and always love using the products from this line at other friends homes. I decided to purchase a couple of the candles to see what i thought.Unfortunately, the 2 basil candles i ordered seemed to have a potential quality concern that may have happened in storage. I know for a candle to burn evenly you have to allow the top layer of wax to melt completely before putting it out. I attempted to burn these evenly but the flames kept putting itself out! There are now a number of rings of different levels of the wax because i wasn't able to burn it evenly. If there is anything you can do, please let me know.I did reach out to the actual company and they informed me that they don't have an account with Amazon to sell these products direct from the manufacturer so they don't have control over what happens during the storage or distribution of these items if they are coming from Amazon."
3,4-Oct-18,1,"Lavender scent overpowering, w/o even lighting it. unless you need a candle to cover up a really bad odor, this candle may be too strong for you. I returned mine."
3,17-May-20,5,"I love Meyer's Basil scent items! I love these candles! These smell just like their other basil product scents. My only complaint is that it's a little pricy for candles. I have no choice but to buy them because I love this scent! They also last a long time. I accidentally left the candle burning overnight and there was still more than half of the candle left. Overall, I'd purchase again because I love the smell."
3,1-Nov-18,1,"Smells like soap Smells like soap, not lavender at all."
3,15-May-19,4,"wish these were bigger + burned more effectively my favorite scented candle BY FAR - fills the whole room and lingers, the smell is still pronounced even when unlit. it's kind of like a sharp, clean lavender rather than overly sweet or floral. masks pet odors completely. good smells aside, i'm incredibly disappointed in burn time. a 2 pack of these candles lasts just over a week in my home where i burn them a few hours a day, and there is always quite a bit of wax left in the bottom of the jar by the time the wick burns out. i've begin melting leftovers together to make a new candle"
3,25-Apr-20,1,"Don't even think about trimming wick. I buy candles all the time and try and buy ""better"" quality.  I thought these would be a good in between candle.  Wrong!  It was a pack of 2.  Each candle only burned 2/3 of the way down.  I felt so bad throwing out the first jar with so much wax left.  Then,  burned the 2nd one, same thing.  No good.  Will not buy their candles again.  I have had votive candles that last longer..."
3,5-Mar-20,3,"Great fragrance, but doesn't burn all the way I love the fragrance of these candles!  However, I can't really recommend them as out of 5 I have burned so far, none of them burned all the way down and you end up wasting about an inch of wax at the bottom of the jar."
3,31-Jan-19,1,"Gave me one of the worst headaches ever! I love the rest of the Lavender line by Mrs. Meyer‚Äôs, so when I saw these candles I thought it was a no-brainer - why wouldn‚Äôt I want this smell in candle form, too?Well, I lit one up, left it going for an hour at most, and I had to blow it out because I was developing a horrible headache. For the next 8 or so hours, I had one of the most awful migraines of my life. It was truly incredible. I don‚Äôt know what about this candle triggered it, as I‚Äôm a fan of lavender and their other products, but I say approach this candle with caution."
3,24-Aug-20,1,"No Scent at all These were the worse overpriced candles I have ever purchased. If you like looking at a flame then they are great, but if you actually want a scent from the candle-like I expected then this isn't the candle for you. I don't mind paying extra for a good smelling candle but this one didn't smell at all."
3,22-Oct-19,5,"Wonderful Lavender Scent I buy these to burn in my Family Law firm. They create a wonderful, calming smell for clients and employees! Lord knows we all need to relax."
3,25-Apr-20,4,"Great quality, lavender scent was not great I can tell the quality in this product, but the lavender scent is gross... not a calming lavender, and maybe I received a bad batch b/c people seem to like it, but honestly, it burned for about 2 hrs, and it was so overwhelming, I took the candle and the other one outside, and I had to air out the room... and the scent still lingered... I gave the candles away.  If the candle was in Mrs Meyer‚Äôs plum berry, it will be delicious... I love her products, but this lavender scent is not for me (and I typically love lavender).  I will buy the candles again, but will physically smell before ordering."
3,23-Mar-20,1,"Just Plain Nasty This candle smelled like a cheap urinal cake.  I like their cleaning products, even though they ride the line of smelling ""natural"".  This scent of this candle was intolerable to me and my family.  It also gave me a sneeze attack the two times I tried to light it.  Sorry, Mrs. Meyers, but you screwed up on this product.  Stick to cleaning products."
3,28-Oct-19,4,Great scent. Long burning. But... I love the scent and longevity of these candles.  I recommend and have purchased 7. However...  No matter what is said they leave a fair amt of wax behind.
3,12-Jan-20,3,"Soy scented wax candles I  ordered the 2ct lavender & the 2 ct  geraniums scent. I received 4 of the lavender. Was disappointed. The candles burn a long time as described. The lavender scent is very mild, actually I wish a little stronger. Other wise a excellent price for the size & burn time. I gave it a 3 star do to sending me 4 of the same scent. It would be a inconvenience to send back."
3,27-Feb-19,1,Candles Arrived broken Unable to use them as they came broken. Can't return because there is glass all over inside the box.
3,29-Feb-20,3,Ugh the soy smell is bad I love this brand! So I was very excited to see my favorite scent came in a candle. When i opened the jar i was happy. It smells just like the soap. But when I lite it it changes smells. The candle smells bad. The soy used comes on so strong. I would of preferred a regular wax version. Sadly this will be the last one even purchased.
3,17-Oct-20,5,"Great value, very happy with these These are much better than I hoped, and price is waaay better than I store.The smell is subtle, but pleasant.  This was my 2nd order, and compared to some more expensive candles I've tried, these are the best.  Would like to try some other scents, but for the price, I'm happy with what ever is available."
3,9-Sep-19,5,Great candle! I usually buy candles that cost three times this much. These have a great scent that fill my home the same way the more expensive ones do.I‚Äôve already burned one of them on several occasions for several hours at a time and I still have over half of it left. I highly recommend!
3,15-Nov-20,3,"Don't burn all the way down They are not very big, not much of a scent, they are expensive and almost never burn down all the way. There's typically about an inch of wax still in the jar when the wic will not relight. If they charged three bucks per candle, then they would be worth the money. Bit of a RIP-off. I might go back to just making my own organic candles."
3,9-Sep-20,5,Basil candle! I had no idea that Mrs Meyers had candles. The basil is my allTime favorite scent and was so happy to find the candles in basil. I shared one with my sister as well. I use the all purpose Basil cleaner all over my house and can now have that clean scent any time with the candle
3,27-Jul-18,1,"Lavender?!? These do NOT smell like lavender. I use lavender soaps, essential oils, and have actual plants. This is rose and linen. Maybe. But it‚Äôs definitely not lavender."
3,20-Jun-20,5,Best Purchases Ever ?üïØ?üïØ Great smelling candles and last & last! I bought to honor my Mom on her Birthday as I do every year‚ÄºÔ?è‚ù§Ô?è  Lit for 12 hrs and has many many hours left. The other candle will be used for my Father as I light one for him too every year ‚ù§Ô?èVery Very Happy with this purchases ?üïØ?üïØ
3,8-May-20,5,Sweet Love the candle. Love the scent. I usually use Yankee Candles but I love the all natural contents however this candle will not last very long. I burned it ten hours the first day. Only half remains. I was disappointed in the duration. Everything else is great.
3,3-Feb-19,3,"Bad batch maybe? I purchased a set of these. They came quick and there was no damage. Usually with these candles you can get a spot warm with your finger before burning to smell the scent. However, I didnt quite smell anything. Both of these ha e been burning in my small apartment for at least 2 hours now and I smell nothing. No lavender, no clean smell. Very sad :("
3,7-Mar-20,2,"Wastes a lot of candle Ordered multiples.  Loved the smell.  When they got close to the bottom, the wick wasn‚Äôt set right so a lot of wasted candle."
3,15-Apr-20,3,"Too Strong For My Liking I LOVE lavender anything. I had a bit higher hopes for this one. I think the masses would enjoy it, actually! I think for me personally, it was stronger than I was expecting. Love their Honeysuckle scent! I can‚Äôt do over powering smells- I get headaches. If you like a stronger lavender, this ones for you! I recommend lighting it in larger spaces!"
3,8-May-20,3,"Will not buy again The smell wasn't enough. The wick didn't burn to the bottom and nasty smell when you blow out candle. Quickly recap to keep the nasty smell from area. I will stick to the wood wick candles that put out better scent, wick burns to bottom and no nasty smell when you blow the wick out. Will not buy again ‚ò?Ô?è"
3,3-Nov-20,2,"Not a good purchase ! Okay folks I'll be brief, if you're looking for a great burning candle with a great aroma look elsewhere. This particular aroma ""BASIL"" is so basic and bland I felt the need to warn people who are considering purchasing this candle to not waste your money."
3,23-Aug-18,5,They smell great. I've had Mrs Meyers candles before but I don't remember them smelling this good. I'm  glad that I got two of them. They should last awhile. I'm a 70 year old man and I have a truckload of the parafin candles that burn my eyes and throat. I thought that it smelled like lemon so I asked my son and he agreed.
3,6-Dec-18,3,"Doesn't smell like lavender I own this brand of candle in a pine scent, which I don't think they make anymore. I really liked that one. This one however, I gave to a friend as I didn't care for it. It doesn't smell much like lavender. It has a waxy soy kind of smell, that you can kind of feel in the air. Not sure how to describe it, but I didn't care for it. Doesn't mean you won't, but not my cup of tea."
3,22-Jul-17,1,"One Star smells like cleaning product, can't stand it"
3,7-Jun-19,1,Overpowering medicinal scent-- not pleasant Overpowering medicinal scent-- not pleasant-- doesn't last very long-- burns quickly.
3,19-Sep-20,1,"No basil scent whatsoever.  A major disappointment! We buy the basil hand soap all the time and it is a terrific product.  I grow basil and the soap has a beautiful basil aroma on your hands.  Thinking the candles would be the same, I purchased this 2 pack for my wife and looked forward to receiving them.  What a disappointment.  Not only is there no basil scent in these candles, these candles have virtually no scent at all.  I'll comment later on the lavender candles which she hasn't tried yet."
3,30-Jun-18,4,Not lavender at all but distinct I got these as much for the jar as the candle. Noted all of the reviews regarding the scent. Not sure how they decided on lavender as it's as close to teriyaki as it is to lavender. Doesn't mean it's bad just not lavender. Honestly the first burn (when the oils where most at the top) it was undoubtedly Copenhagen with a hint of Jack Daniels. Now it's a more subtle version closer to my dad's old pipe tobacco kit. So I don't mind it but I understand complaints based on expectations. With proper attention to the wick and wax it should last as long as specified. Very satisfied overall.
3,11-Aug-20,5,Mrs. Meyer‚Äôs Candles Mrs. Meyer‚Äôs candles always have amazing scents and they last much longer than I would expect. The 2-packs come at a great value. The jars can also be cleaned out and re-used for several different purposes once the candles run out.
3,20-Sep-20,3,"Not my kind of lavender smell Lavender is a hit or miss fragrance.  These candles, for me, were a definite miss.  When I smell lavender, it either has a slightly sweet smell, or it smells vaguely like scratch and sniff cheese stickers.  These tended towards the latter."
3,3-Apr-20,3,Not as good as hand soap scent I absolutely love the hand soap but am a bit disappointed with these candles.  I don't feel they give off as much scent as I'd hoped.  I have tried the lavender scented candle and love that one.  I think I'll stay with the hand soap and switch out the candle scent.
3,21-Mar-19,5,"Love the scent These are great. I use Mrs Meyers lavender hand soap, dish soap, and spray so I wanted to 'complete' the line up and give these a try. Was not disappointed. This is my second purchase. If you're familiar with the other products you can expect this scent to be quite similar. Makes the kitchen/dining area feel clean and cozy."
3,23-Apr-20,5,"Subscribe because you‚Äôll want more! I love all things Mrs Meyers and I love candles. The combination of those makes me so happy! These candles are amazing. I lit one around 9 am yesterday and it burned all day until 8 pm and wasn't even missing 1/4 of the candle!! And the smell, ugh, so so good!"
3,29-Jan-19,4,"Not my favorite scent I love Mrs Meyer's products so I bought these cause... what a great deal.  The lavender scent is a little bit manufactured for me, not quite the natural lavender scent that you get with some other candles.  Not a big deal since I just use these as kitchen candles to get rid of cooking smells, but probably wouldn't use them in other parts of the house.  Still a good product and getting use of it, so giving it 4 stars."
3,23-Apr-20,3,"Lavender smells like Citronella.... This is a good soy candle, but I think it was mislabeled. I couldn‚Äôt figure out the scent until my husband said it smelled like citronella throughout the house.I‚Äôm now hesitant to try out the other scents."
3,19-Jun-20,4,"Maybe I'll try the lavender? This was my first time buying this product, Well Made! At first the scent was so strong my husband asked me to blow it out and he normally does not notice/smells anything at first. The smell tapers off as the candle gets used."
3,14-Jan-19,1,"Not worth buying I wanted to order candles online and trust Meyer's as a brand. Once I received these candles, I was unsure if I liked the smell, so I lit one to see if the smell would grow on me. The smell of these candles made me so nauseous and do not smell like lavender. I wish I could return them, but I already lit them so I don't think I can :(. Don't spend your money on the lavender smell."
3,4-Sep-19,2,"yuck I did not like the scent of this candle.  I am very familiar with lavender candles, sprays, etc.  I don't know what this smells like, but it isn't lavender.  Thank you, Amazon, for easy returns."
3,9-Feb-17,1,Bad smell Very gross smell that made us all nauseous. Had to return these.
3,19-Oct-18,5,"Such a good bang for the buck God I love these candles. They lasted me so long and cost probably half or a third of the price that I would pay for them at a grocery store or convenience store in New York City. The smell is perfectly subtle...not too overpowering where you walk into a room and it‚Äôs like a perfume store. Smells natural, clean, and refreshing."
3,22-Jan-19,3,"powerful scent These candles have a powerful scent. Smells like a blend of lavender and rosemary to me. I cannot leave it lit for very long as the scent overpowers my small home. Gave one to a friend and they love it. Will not buy again for myself, but overall a nice, long-lasting candle that packs a powerful punch."
3,20-Sep-19,5,Wonderful These candles last!! The scent is amazing and not overwhelming like some bother natural soy candles tend to be.
3,18-Apr-20,5,"Smell soooo good! These smell great even when they aren't lit! I sometimes just open the top to let the good smell out and don't even light them. They do last a really long time though, which is nice."
3,18-Apr-20,5,Worth the money !! So strong! This is the strongest smelling candle I‚Äôve ever had. I lit the two I bought today and within two minutes my entire house smelled amazing. Super happy with this brand . I‚Äôll be buying these from now on.
3,6-Aug-20,1,"It doesn‚Äôt work. No scent Don‚Äôt purchase this item! It doesn‚Äôt have a decent smell, maybe will work for a small closed room, maybe in the bathroom, I got to try that but other way it doesn‚Äôt work. I‚Äôm very disappointed because I love the basil scent on this products and now this."
3,9-Dec-18,5,"One Candle Fills the Whole House I love the smell of lavender, so I gave these candles a try. I was pretty amazed that the scent filled my whole house. It‚Äôs not an overpowering scent but just pure and clean smelling. The candle also lasts a very long time. Will definitely be buying more of these and skipping the Glade, Airwick & Yankee lavender scented candles."
3,12-May-20,5,"Will Definitely Order Again I light candles every morning and keep them lit as I work at my computer most of the day. I like Mrs. Meyer's products and thought I'd give these a try. Really impressed with the scent (quite strong but I love the clean, fresh smell) and it burns down so well. No wasting of the candle wax like I have with other, less expensive candles. Much better value for the money! I'll be ordering these again!"
3,14-Dec-19,4,"The smell? I love everything Mrs. Meyers!  Basil is my favorite scent for the kitchen but these seem a little off.  Not quite as fresh as the soap or the all purpose spray, which is my favorite.They last a long time and I‚Äôm still using, the scents just off a little."
3,12-Aug-18,4,"Smells great, not lavendar though! Smells awesome. Really makes the whole room smell fantastic. Problem is this was suppose to be lavender, but it is not. I am not sure what it is, and don't get me wrong--it smells good--it's just not lavender. /shrug"
3,24-Sep-18,5,Great clean smell I love the Mrs Myer's brand and this does not disappoint. The candle is a bit small but it does pack a good punch. The smell is nice and clean and the candle does seem to burn clean.I like the recloseable lid as well. The jar can be reused after the candle is gone for storage of small things.
3,22-May-20,5,Nice candles I love Meyer‚Äôs products so this was a nice treat. I‚Äôve been looking for a light and delicate scent for my home office and these candles are perfect. They smell clean and fresh.
3,9-Jun-19,5,"worth buying the bigger size ! LOVE this scent. potent and has a large throw, makes my whole downstairs area smell fresh and clean. make sure to trim the wick. doesn‚Äôt burn all the way down and some sticks to the sides, but I melt down the extra wax and use it as a wax melt in my warmer !!"
3,7-May-20,5,Great product short burn life. I absolutely loved these candles and the scent it produces is absolutely amazing. I love to burn candles all night and these will burn all night but won‚Äôt last long. I wish they offered a giant slow burning candle!
3,20-May-20,5,"Smells amazing I wish that the entire thing was utilized but there is about 3/4"" that doesn't end up getting used. I spooned out the rest into my wax warmer and that worked well enough for me."
3,26-Sep-19,4,"Faint Scent Nice candle and presentation.  However, I could barely smell the scent."
3,22-Oct-20,2,Don‚Äôt get your hopes up I love the smell of this candle up close but it definitely does not fill the room with any scent.  The wick does not stay lit.  I am disappointed in this purchase.
3,19-Apr-20,2,"Just smells like olive oil I love the basil soap and all purpose spray, but this candle just didn‚Äôt smell great. Smelled like olive oil! They do burn for a long time and are in a pretty jar. I would recommend these for a small space (bathroom, small office, etc). I would not buy these again."
3,2-May-20,3,"Just Ok Smells nice, just like the lavender soap which we love. However, these candles don‚Äôt last very long and don‚Äôt burning with 1/4 jar of the wax still left. Would recommend only if in your price range, don‚Äôt splurge on these."
3,20-Jun-18,3,"I LOVE Mrs. Meyer's lavender products I LOVE Mrs. Meyer's lavender products, but unfortunately, was not overly impressed with the candle. I like a lavender candle with a little more umph!To me, the fragrance is okay, but not like the other products (I have the hand soap, room spray, multi-surface cleaner). I can only smell this candle when I am within a few feet."
3,7-Jul-20,5,Doesn't make me sneeze Very happy with the purchase. The fragrance really seems to come from the essential oil unlike some other candles that claim to have essential oil but for a trace amount along with the copious amounts of cheap artificial fragrance. The smell lingers for a couple days after using it. Absolutely love it. Worth my money.
3,29-Mar-20,5,"Love them I ordered these to surprise my husband because he loves this scent in our hand soap we have. We love the candles just as much, and they smell great"
3,23-Sep-18,5,"Good for Apartment Life It's easy for wierd smells to wander around your apartment especially if you cook a lot. This candle works great at helping ""freshen up the air"" without pumping parabins and toxic @(*#@ into the air you breath. Smells delightful, lasts pretty long, love it so far. Easy 5 Stars."
3,24-Apr-20,3,scent I am sorry to say it does not smell like lavender to me.  I don't even know what it smells like.A few days later.....i have tried it about 3 times i think it smells something like honey
3,28-Oct-18,5,WOW! Great candle! LOVE LOVE LOVE 12-06-18 UPDATE: OMG!! All I have to do is take the lid off and the room fills with such a beautiful scent. It‚Äôs not overpowering at all. Just right. I love these candles.Burns clean and smells WONDERFUL!! I love this candle. I‚Äôll buy again.
3,30-Mar-20,5,Love these! I only use soy candles.  These are top quality and I love how they burn and smell.  Will be ordering again. Highly recommend.
3,20-Dec-19,5,Lovely! I love these candles! The lavender scent is lovely and the jar with lid is easily reusable (I boiled the jar to melt the last bit of wax). They lasted about 40 hours each. I will definitely order these again.
3,22-Nov-19,1,"Lavender? All I'm smelling is stale beer I bought these because they were highly rated by a third party. I love lavender smell. Unfortunately, these don't smell like lavender, all. It smells like sour/stale beer. My fianc?© came home and said they could smell it down the hall from the elevator and thought there was a frat party happening somewhere. Gross - going in the trash :("
3,7-Jan-19,3,"Does not smell as expected I would like to caveat this review by saying I don't claim to be an expert on lavender or how it ""should"" smell. With that said, this candle doesn't smell like lavender to me. The design is nice and I appreciate the ethos behind soy-based candles, but to me it smells closer to wine. If you enjoy that smell, I would definitely recommend this candle. I haven't tried Mrs. Meyer's other scented candles, but I would recommend the Cheseapeake Bay lavender candle over this lavender candle."
3,25-Jun-17,5,These candles smell wonderful and really do take away unpleasant smells These candles smell wonderful and really do take away unpleasant smells. I cooked burgers on a pan on the stove and the house stunk like grease.  I lit one of these candles and within 30 minutes the smell was gone and it was replaced with the peaceful lavendar scent.
3,19-Mar-19,5,"Another quality product by Mrs. Meyers I LOVE the Mrs. Meyers line, especially the lavender scented items. I use their entire laundry line...so when I discovered the candles I was overjoyed! These candles are a slow burn, no black smoke candle that smell as wonderful as their lavender laundry products! I will keep these on hand!!!"
3,13-Apr-20,4,"Great candle despite glass being broken when I got it! The base of one of the candles was broken when I got them, but I duct taped it and it is burning great because it‚Äôs clearly a quality candle! Burns great. Smell is romantic and gentle, with no nauseating hints at all. Love it! Just wish it would not have been broken when I got it. I will be ordering again! I wish it was way bigger!"
3,4-Apr-20,2,"Smells differeny than cleaning products. I love the scent for cleaning products but found it to be a little different scent than those.  It's much weaker in scent and i gent it left an undesirable after scent when blown out. Even though i will definitely continue to get the Basil dish soap, i wouldn't order this again in a candle."
3,31-Jan-20,5,Definitely recommend Scent is delicious! Went to a restaurant and they had this candle in their bathroom and I had to have it so I ordered two and have them at my dance studio. People walk in and compliment the smell all the time!
3,28-Mar-20,5,Smells so clean and fresh Excellent candle smells very clean and fresh and tu turn off just place the top on it and it will turn off no smell.
3,24-Apr-17,2,"Doesn't smell like lavender. This hardly smells like lavender - by any stretch.  It smells more like a jelly bean of unknown fruit origin.  Grape?  I honestly wonder if my candles were mislabeled (I bought 2).  Lavender should be pretty straight forward in scent.  Because they smell better than a damp bathroom, I've decided to use them, rather than return them.  Definitely don't recommend, and won't buy again."
3,25-Aug-19,1,"Careful on opening, possible broken glass jars!! These candles need to be packed better, came broken with glass spilling out of the boxes!!  Dangerous could have cut myself on the glass pieces."
3,3-Jun-20,1,Destroyed package/great scent The scent is great! But whoever packaged this was quite upset. One of the candles came completely broken. I had planned to return it but my time expired..so now I‚Äôm left with a completely broken candle.
3,9-Nov-20,5,"Scent and durability, unparallel Super scent and durability, I also happen to recycle the container, as informal drinkware or herb pots"
3,29-Dec-17,5,"I love Mrs Meyers candles I love Mrs Meyers candles, this specific Lavender scent was great, light scent, but filled the room with the scent of Lavender, will be purchasing again, also note, these are not the smaller candles, these are a very nice size for a gift, everyone liked them.."
3,8-May-20,5,Lovely Smell Loved the scent of these candles but sadly one candle broke due to poor packaging and care for the package... so sad
3,21-Jan-20,4,great scent love the scent.  Only burned so long and when it went out I still have an inch of candle left.  That's why 4 stars
3,18-Jun-20,4,"Smells great, do not last as long as expected These smell amazing but they burn out and don‚Äôt work when there‚Äôs tons of wax left (wick is done) which is super disappointing."
3,24-Jun-20,2,Very little sent. LOVE Mrs.Meyer basil products. these candles are small with minimal-if any scent. Will not purchase again.
3,28-Apr-20,3,Seems wasteful I really wanted to love these. I was happy that they are soy wax and not beeswax. The smell was subtle but burned very fast and was left with a lot of wax at the bottom once the wick burned out which seems like a waste
3,21-Oct-20,2,"Scent is Strange First of all, I love Mrs. Meyers products so I had HIGH hopes for these candles. However the scent is strange to say the least. Nothing like the surface cleaner and hand soap scent I love so much. Additionally, I had similar wick issues other reviews talk about and for the price point and size I will not be purchasing again."
3,19-Feb-20,4,"It's good This product is good but the scent wasn't exactly what I like, still it is good in bathrooms to make them smell better and the price is right.  Overall I would recommend this company but maybe a different scent."
3,16-Mar-19,4,"Lite odor It doesn't smell heavily as we thought, yet smelling good. The fact that it is safer comparing to several other brands, makes it easy choice. Wishing it had a 'deeper' odor."
3,16-Jul-20,4,"Amazing scent, does not fully burn all the wax This is my favorite scented candle for relaxing but it doesn‚Äôt burn all the wax, when it gets to the end it will no longer light and I hate wasting money."
3,12-Jan-19,5,"Love the long burn time. Good value. Fresh scent, not really lavender. Very long burn time compared to other more expensive candles. This was pleasing. Definitely a strong, clean scent, more like Mrs. Meyers cleaning products than actual lavender but I didn‚Äôt mind. I have a very small house and use one in the bathroom and one in the living room and the whole place smells great. It‚Äôs recommended to burn them for 3-4 hours daily. I get 2 a month on subscribe and save and it seems to be enough."
3,25-Jan-18,1,The candles are not worth the cost. They do ... The candles are not worth the cost.  They do not have much of an odor at all.  Will not purchase again
3,6-Jun-20,5,"Best candles EVER I'm obsessed with Meyer Clean Day. I regularly gift candles in all scents, but this is my personal favorite. I have the laundry detergent, fabric softner, dryer sheets and air freshner (my least favorite product, but still useful). I recomend them all. Find your scent snd you'll have wonderful cleaning products for life!"
3,9-May-18,1,Smelled great! The glass was broken on one of my candles.Smelled great!
3,14-Jun-20,3,Disappointed!! smells good but doesn't burn very good and doesn't burn all the way down. Disappointed!
3,12-May-20,5,"Meyers never fails OBSESSED with the smell. I already love all the products, but the candles may be my new favorite product."
3,30-Jun-20,5,"Love them!!! What a great candle! Sent us just as I hoped! Love this product, love this product!"
3,18-Feb-19,2,The scent is pretty overpowering The scent is pretty over-powering and a bit odd. The candles are held in glass which was smashed all to bits. It also got glass all over the other food item that was packaged in the same box. Basically a disaster.
3,18-Apr-20,2,The two I received in lavender were less fragrant than what I have come to expect from this brand. Mrs Meyer's candles are usually very fragrant. I have used them before but these were less fragrant. Not sure why.
3,4-Oct-20,5,Smells clean Smells amazing! And made my whole house smell so good ! Absolutely love these
3,20-Aug-19,5,My Favorite Clean Scent! I love this scent to use the cleaning products that match it. This candle burns very well and has a good throw. I've received several compliments from house guest!
3,1-Nov-20,5,"Last the scent I try other brands, but so far Mr Meyers are the candles that last and really brings the scent in the environment. I highly recommend them."
3,29-Dec-19,1,Smells awful Basil is my absolute favorite scent but these candles are awful.  Smells like citronella.  Smells nothing like the soaps
3,5-Aug-20,5,Good candle Great candle! Doesn‚Äôt burn all the way down but still a good candle.
3,14-Jan-20,5,I don't get a headache I don't get a headache and it fills the room with a lovely and light lavender scent.
3,10-Sep-19,1,Shattered via transport Arrived totally shattered. It‚Äôs a lot less sexy to see a candle held together with duct tape... I‚Äôd think twice about ordering anything glass from Amazon tbh. Cheers!
3,7-Sep-20,5,such a clean smell If you want fresh without overpowering scent - this Is it
3,6-Jul-20,2,"Burn well, smell if very subtle Nice candles, they burn well, burn clean, the scent is not strong, but it is there."
3,9-Sep-20,2,Not impressed The smell is strong and smells like cleaning products instead of lavender
3,5-Apr-19,5,"Smells wonderful I absolutely love the smell of these!! And they have lasted a long time, I light them every time I clean the house and it makes me feel so good :)"
3,8-May-20,1,‚ò? Candles were upside down. Candles were melt and it was wax in the box. ‚ò?
3,20-Feb-20,5,Pleasant scent These are nice candles. Not too much scent. Not overpowering at all
3,28-May-18,5,"These candles are excellent, so far I have give it as a ... These candles are excellent, so far I have give it as a gift to friends, and they love it. The lavander frequence is marvelous, soft, and pleasant.Perfect for bathrooms when you have guest over. Or in the living room."
3,8-Feb-20,5,Great Gift Purchased as Gifts. Well received. Wonderful scent. Not overpowering.
3,2-Jun-20,3,Not true Lavender Was super excited for these as I loved the lemon one. Unfortunately for those who are familiar with fresh lavender this is not it. Smells more like a sweeter fragrant cleaning product.
3,14-Aug-19,4,Not What I Would Expect from Meyer I always love Meyer's cleaning products.  These candles were not as fragrant as expected and quite expensive for the ounces.
3,30-Apr-19,5,LOVE I LOVE LOVE LOVE these candles. The Basil scent is absolutely my favorite. They make my small space smell fresh and clean with a crisp scent. Only thing critique I have is that the wicks in mine ended with about half an inch of wax still in the bottom. I just scrapped it out and used it in a wax warmer and then had the cute jars to use for other things. Great product!! I am buying these again!
3,12-Jul-20,2,Meh. Wouldn‚Äôt buy again Doesn‚Äôt put out a lot of scent when lit. I love love love the cleaning spray and the room spray of this scent. You can really only smell it if your standing right next to it.
3,4-Jan-19,5,Smell great Smells great and last. I am able to come into my room and smell the lavender. The candle is not overpowering either. It is perfect. I light this when I am reading or studying.
3,1-May-20,3,"Clean scent These candles have a clean scent, NOT A LAVENDER scent.  They are aesthetically pleasing, just not what I was hoping for scent-wise."
3,18-Oct-20,3,"Very subtle scent, but doesn‚Äôt give headache. The scent is too subtle for me, but it‚Äôs one of the only candles I‚Äôve found that doesn‚Äôt give me a headache. I also use the Mrs Meyers basil scent cleaning products, so the candle makes me feel like my house smells clean."
3,3-Oct-18,5,Lavender? More like LOVENDER. These are some of the best smelling candles I‚Äôve ever had. It is slightly floral and slightly fresh laundry smelling. I‚Äôve purchased them several times. The brand is used across my entire house. Highly recommend
3,25-Apr-20,5,"Scent is spot on, very lavender! Smells so good and last a pretty long time. Only complaint is that one came broken. So be careful when you open for glass. They replaced right away! I recommend"
3,3-May-20,1,Save your money Dont waste your money go to Target to get better quality.  No wicks and candle wax wasnt full
3,27-Nov-18,3,"Candle Not Full Candle smells great (got the lavender scent). My only complaint is that you can tell from the side of the glass jar that it is not a full and that there is some space where there is no wax to burn.Otherwise, pretty average candle."
3,8-May-20,1,"Didn‚Äôt smell any fragrance I‚Äôm a big fan of the lavender dish soap, but personally, I couldn‚Äôt smell anything from these candles.  Like literally nothing.  I lit a different branded candle that‚Äôs very subtle at the same time and it overpowered the nonexistent lavender.  Disappointed."
3,28-Jul-20,5,Great!!! This is the best one they have the lavender
3,12-Mar-19,5,Very fragrant lavender. The candles are so flagrant. They do not have to be burning to fill the room. Great quality they last a long time. I will buy again.
3,6-May-20,5,Refreshing Love it will contribute to buy
3,4-Sep-20,1,Smells like awful green jolly rancher candy This smells absolutely nothing like basil
3,15-Jan-20,1,"Medicinal chemical smell I opened the lid and it smelled just like their lavender cleaning products, it smells synthetic and of chemicals. I returned whit burning."
3,10-Jan-20,2,"Smell good, but do not last long First set I ordered 1 arrived broken, replacement was quickly delivered. I love the smell, just wish they burned longer. Already used up 1 after burning only a couple ours."
3,8-Jun-20,1,a full inch doesn't burn a full inch of the candle doesn't burn and that is on all of them.  Wouldn't recommend even though they smell amazing.  its not worth the cost.
3,28-Apr-20,1,Little to no scent after the cable has been lit for a few hours in a small room. I love Mrs. Meyers products and this is my favorite scent. I won‚Äôt be repurchasing the candles the scent is very faint after having it lit for a few hours.
3,3-May-20,3,Didn‚Äôt last as long as I hoped! Unfortunately only got thru about 3/4 of both of them before the wick burned out. Any idea how to make them last longer? Feel like it‚Äôs such a waste of the wax but the candles were great while they lasted. Does this happen with all Meyer‚Äôs candles? First time buy and a bit disappointed!
3,22-Mar-20,1,Smells for first 3 minutes The oils they use do not burn well at all.  Very sad because all of Mrs Meyes products are awesome but this did not smell up my house like a yankee or bath and body would.
3,5-Jul-20,5,Love these Always love these clean candles
3,12-Mar-20,5,"Good candle These candles smell very nice and are a decent price. I light it for a few hours every night, so it doesn‚Äôt last super long."
3,20-Mar-20,1,Zero scent Lack of scent and burn time
3,30-Jan-20,1,Not worth the price As the candle got to the bottom 1/4 I noticed the wick holder metal piece was slanted so badly that the wick would no longer stay lite.  Poor craftsmanship for the price and expectations of is specialty brand as they portray themselves to be!!
3,1-Jul-18,5,"Great candles These are great. I can smell their fresh lavender scent through my house. My house is pretty large and open, so other candles haven‚Äôt really doing the trick. These are perfect"
3,7-Jan-20,4,Product is great; packaging not so much! One candle arrived fine and smells great. The other the glass was broken badly and had to throw away.
3,13-Aug-19,5,"Amazing Scent I absolutely love these candles, they smell so good, and last for a while"
3,9-Mar-20,5,Recommend Long lasting smell great
3,6-Sep-18,2,Very disappointed I was very disappointed with the scent. I can barely smell it when standing beside it. I was also disappointed in the way it burns. It burns like a regular wax candle and not soy. I went back to my wax melts.
3,6-Dec-19,1,Does not smell like lavender I was disappointed in the smell. Very strong and nothing like lavender.
3,12-Feb-19,3,"If you lit enough of these you could smell them from Space This blew my nostrils out, probably great for those who like STRONG smelling candles. Scent itself is nice, just keeping the lid off without lighting it scented an entire room and 12 foot hallway."
3,25-Sep-20,1,Candle offers No Scent I purchased this particular scent because I liked it at my massage therapists office. I have burned this candle all day and it provided no scent. I do not recommend buying this from Amazon.
3,8-Oct-19,5,Great smelling candles I love mrs Myers products. Good quality price and overall worth it
3,11-Sep-17,5,"Seriously best scent ever Seriously best scent ever!! I leave one of these open, but never lit, in my bathroom and it smells AMAZING."
3,10-Jul-18,5,Smells GREAT! These smell great (not like grandma lavender) and have a clean burn. I ordered 4 and I am confident I will order more.  Thank you Mrs. Meyer's!  I love your products!
3,28-Aug-20,5,Best scent Mrs. Meyers has the best scents. The smell is pretty strong but pleasant and it lasts forever! Highly recommend.
3,19-Oct-18,5,The scent y‚Äôall! The scent is insanely amazing!!!!! I typically have to be very careful with scents due to migraines. If I had the money I‚Äôd purchase a case if this scent!
3,2-Jul-19,3,Wonderful! I LOVE the Mrs. Meyers products and this is a great candle...just wish it lasted longer.
3,18-Aug-20,5,Decent size and longevity Great scent
3,30-Apr-20,2,Scent is very light I liked the smell (pretty good). Very clean. The issue I have is that is does not fill the room. Usually I‚Äôm lighting a scented candle...to fill the room with scent. I‚Äôve not experienced much room-filming scent with this one. Was disappointed to be honest.
3,18-Jul-19,2,Damaged Product One of the candles was broken and I would like it replaced without having to return it because it‚Äôs glass and it‚Äôs dangerous.
3,17-Nov-18,1,Arrived smashed. Arrived smashed in a million pieces.
3,1-Mar-19,5,"versatile Who doesn't like lavender? These go well anywhere. Great for kitchen, bathroom, but the scent throws really well in a small house. I hold onto the jar and lids. good catch alls!"
3,25-Jun-18,2,"Smell great when they work Smell great when they work! Ive ordered quite a few of these and some stop burning half way through and then wont stay lit after that, others wont stay lit passed the first 5 minutes and never work after that.  Seems the soy is too thick for the wicks."
3,10-Jun-20,2,"Wastes 30%+ of the candle every single time Such a waste, they smell wonderful but last not even close to 35 hours because, as other reviewers have commented, they burn out permanently when the was is down to about 33% full. Needs a reformulation/re-design!"
3,28-Mar-19,5,"Love these candles These candles have the best scents!!!  It is fragrant, yet subtle.  Plus, these candles don't expel a burnt wax smell like other candles."
3,21-Dec-19,5,Long burn life Nice candle.  Burn for many hours with a moderate scent.
3,27-Dec-19,5,"I love meyers Best candles, smell amazing and last pretty long"
3,30-Mar-20,5,Smells amazing! Delivery was quick. Item as described and a great value.
3,14-Aug-19,4,They smell amazing! These smell absolutely amazing!!! I think I‚Äôm addicted to the scent. My only complaint is they don‚Äôt last very long. But still worth it
3,8-Apr-20,2,Scent is overwhelming The scent is way too overwhelming and gives me a headache. Too much!
3,21-Nov-18,5,"Smells great, lasts a long time each candle last 35 hours and the jar makes it easy to put away for when you have company with more sensitive noses."
3,6-Sep-20,5,That it has a good long-lasting smell I love the smell
3,30-Dec-19,3,Meh Not a fan of the lavender scent. This isn‚Äôt a true lavender smell.
3,19-Jul-19,5,Smells divine These candles smell fantastic. They are not too overpowering.
3,6-Jun-20,1,Broken glass candle delivered One of the candles is broken in the package. I would like a replacement pls. This is the third time I have bought these. I am a loyal customer. It was delivered broken a few minutes ago.
3,25-Jan-20,5,Great purchase I love the scent.
3,30-Jan-19,5,Very nice smell These candles have a great natural scent to them.  Doesn't smell like some cheap artificial scent.
3,4-Apr-19,5,Best Candles These candles are just great and have a long burn time considering the price.  I try and keep them on hand at all times.  They smell nice without being sickly or overpowering.
3,26-Dec-18,1,"Does not smell like pure Lavender Candles had a very strong citrus type scent to it. Could barley smell the lavender. If you are looking for a clean scent this will Work but if you are looking for a soothing Lavender scent, this is not it."
3,25-Jul-19,3,Arrived broken It smells good but I can't comment on its quality since it arrived broken.
3,5-Jul-17,4,"Nice, but doesn't smell like lavender I love Mrs. Meyers products and use many of them in my home. These candles are fragrant and seem to last awhile, unfortunately they don't really smell like lavender. Their smell isn't unpleasant, but when I look for something lavender scented I really want that potent authentic scent."
3,22-Feb-20,5,Amazing Scent I love how it smells and how it looks on my coffee table.
3,26-Sep-20,5,Worth the purchase Love Ms Meyers products.  These candles are quality.
3,8-Jan-20,5,Great candle! Wonderful lavender scent!
3,7-Mar-17,5,Five Stars These are good smelling candles.  Lavender is my favorite
3,22-Mar-19,5,"Smells great! Been buying them for a while now. Never had a problem. This time one jar came broken. Called, sent picture, received a refund for one jar. Thank you."
3,17-Jan-20,1,No smell & they arrived broken The scent is non-existent & one of them arrived broken & I was never refunded!
3,14-Oct-19,4,Great scent really fills the room I love the smell of these candles!
3,4-Feb-19,5,Love the scent The fragrance is strong- often I just leave it out open & not lit for a lingering scent
3,31-Jan-20,5,Wonderful candles. Last so long and fills the whole house with it‚Äôs scent. Not sickening at all.
3,27-Dec-18,2,"It‚Äôs a ‚Äòno‚Äô for me, dog I had to get used to this scent of lavender but it eventually grew on me because these candles last for so long. Hopefully, you like it from the start."
3,21-Jun-20,4,Okay- can‚Äôt fill the room. Burns a while. Smells good but can‚Äôt fill the room
3,15-Dec-19,5,Best Love these candles
3,20-May-19,3,Not for people with fragrance allergies Doesn‚Äôt smell really ‚Äúnatural‚Äù. Too much perfume smell. Doesn‚Äôt smell that much like lavender in my opinion. I am sensitive to fragrances. I would not buy this again.
3,31-Dec-19,2,Headaches from product. Smells very nice but gives me bad headaches.
3,9-Feb-20,4,"Pleasant scent Smell great, but not a very long burn time."
3,25-Aug-20,5,"fresh Great, fresh smell. Lasts about 8 hours"
3,20-Jun-19,5,Great candle High quality candle. Burns fast though. Excellent scent
3,29-May-20,5,Great smell Great smell
3,26-Mar-20,5,"Smells great and soy based, great for people with allergies Read the headline, that's all you need to know."
3,18-Jun-19,3,Not a strong basil scent Definitely does not smell like basil at all. Sent isn't bad but not very strong more floral than basil
3,17-Jan-20,3,Standard candle burn time Just ok
3,14-May-19,5,"Great Candle Bought this packed of two, and it smells great and definitely can last for a long time; Worth the price."
3,28-Dec-18,5,Bought it for a gift I gave this to my adult daughter and she totally loves these candles. She states that it is a lovely clean scent. There is no chemical smell when she burns these candles. She is very satisfied with these candles.
3,7-Jul-20,5,Great scent! Great scent! Love it!
3,14-Jun-18,4,"Good buy Long burn time and nice clean burn. The lavender scent is nice but i wish it was a bit stronger. Jars are really nice, I‚Äôll definetly use them after the candle is gone"
3,16-Dec-19,1,Ew. No. Smells completely terrible. NOT a lavender scent at all. It‚Äôs like someone made a candle out of dust and mold and dank basement scents.
3,13-Sep-20,5,Lavender is Best Fragrance of All Liked the strength of the lavendar fragrance. Wish the wick could burn closer to the bottom.
3,18-Nov-19,5,Buen aroma Me gusto mucho el olor
3,2-Mar-20,5,Great quality Nice Low soot candle
3,17-Feb-19,2,Smell good but received a damaged one. I love these candles but one of the candles was broken in the box and I got glass everywhere when I opened the box.
3,19-May-20,1,Broken glass Broken glass arrived in an intact box.  Disappointed.
3,19-May-20,5,Delicious Lavender Smells heavenly
3,22-Oct-20,1,These were too old These smelled like old candles.  Having to throw them away.  Had to take them out of the room they smelled so bad.  I am sure the manufacturer didn't make them that way.
3,24-Sep-20,1,"Does NOT smell like Basil. This isn't a bad product, but it does NOT smell like basil.  This has a very earthy scent, maybe like wet dirt.  Not sure, but no way does this smell like Basil.  I grow basil at home and I can definitely not smell it.  Bummer."
3,12-Mar-19,5,Smells good not overwhelming They are a little smaller than expected but they smelled good
3,18-Jan-20,5,Will buy again! Very amazing. I love the scent and it burns very nice!!!
3,23-Jun-17,5,"What I excepted Love them, smells just like the hand soap (maybe a bit milder)."
3,3-Jun-20,5,Amazing Scents. They are amazing at removing odors and keep our home smelling wonderful.
3,24-Apr-17,5,Five Stars Love these candels. The basil smells great.
3,24-Apr-18,5,"Smells great and lasts a lot time This candle is awesome. It doesn‚Äôt smell like real lavender, but the smell is wonderful. This candle also burned quite a while. I agree that it should have a longer wick, though."
3,20-Oct-18,5,"Nice scent I don‚Äôt think the size of these candles warrant the price, but they smell so good and do last fairly well."
3,3-Oct-20,1,Wtf Melted wax
3,25-May-20,4,Not strong scent Not a strong scent like I was expecting.
3,27-Mar-20,1,Arrived with broken glass Just received this and I heard glass rattling as I picked up the package. Both candles glass casings were shattered. I'll be requesting a refund.
3,15-Apr-20,5,Slow Burn - Great Scent These candles are very fragrant. They burn slow and evenly. The Lavender Scent fills my 600sqft great room (with cathedral ceilings) in less than 1 hour. I‚Äôll buy these again.
3,6-Aug-18,5,"Excellent product These candles last a long time and have lots of scent.  They burn evenly, too, so very little is wasted."
3,18-Dec-18,2,Not lavender scented Have to agree with many reviews here- smells odd. Definitely not lavender scented
3,1-Nov-20,5,"Longevity Great candle that lasted longer than most! Highly recommend, especially if you light candles often."
3,19-Aug-17,5,Subscribe and Save worthy My favorite scent! It's very light but definitely present. I love how it lingers throughout my whole home but doesn't smell artificial or perfume-y.
3,18-Jan-19,5,Smells great! After loving the dish soap I bought these. They smell great and so far are long lasting.
3,28-Apr-18,2,"one candle in the batch was defective and smelled terrible I buy these candles a lot. On this order one of the candles was normal, but the other was defective and smells awful. I don't see a return option or I would return it."
3,10-May-20,5,These are amazing. Love these!  Smell so good!
3,3-Jun-19,5,Love the candles they give a light scent. Great product and great price
3,22-Oct-17,2,these smelled really artificial and plastic like. Really unhappy with the fragrance. Burn time was longer than my other candles but not significantly. I was hoping the fragrance would be more floral... these smelled really artificial and plastic like.
3,30-Jun-18,2,Gave away to a friend. Not Lavender smell. Maybe Lavender and ginger spice. Don't want to smell it. Smaller than I imagined.
3,25-Sep-19,5,Great smell Smells sooo good. Love Mrs. Meyer's scents.
3,29-Apr-20,3,"Doesn‚Äôt burn all the way through Great scent, just wish the candle would burn to the end. About 20% of candle remains at the end. If you want a candle that burns all the way through I suggest looking at  different product. :-/"
3,2-Mar-20,5,Highly recommend Overall great value for the money
3,13-Nov-19,5,broken One was broken... how to i ship back?
3,31-Jul-19,3,Not fav scent Scent didn‚Äôt last and I prefer verbena
3,20-Apr-20,5,"Amazing, Clean Scent I was initially given 1 as a gift for a secret Santa and it quickly became my favorite candle. I burn in my home office - the space smells so clean and fresh! I can't live without these now."
3,31-Dec-19,5,Nice Nice
3,27-Mar-20,5,Smells great These smell wonderful! ‚ù§Ô?è
3,18-Dec-17,5,These soy candles smell amazing! I'm very excited to include them in Christmas ... These soy candles smell amazing! I'm very excited to include them in Christmas gift baskets I'm making up for my child's therapists.
3,16-Feb-19,4,"Good They are nice, but didn't burn the greatest"
3,9-Jul-19,5,Let be them Excellent
3,26-Jan-20,1,total disappointment no acent
3,1-May-20,1,Don‚Äôt have candles delivered One candle came in a million pieces.
3,2-Jun-20,3,Longer wick... leave a lot of unused candle It smells really nice.  My only complaint is that it leaves about 1/2 of wax on the bottom and you can‚Äôt lit there is no wick to lite.
3,14-Jan-20,5,"A good smell Love the smell, but cant really display bec of the label saying its Meyers"
3,20-Jun-18,1,One Star Absolute waste of money..should've returned them..

3,8-Aug-18,5,pure scent. love lavender candles ... very pure scent
3,5-Mar-18,1,Smells funny compared to usual This used to be my favorite candle smell. I have burnt over 20 of the basil candles over the years. These ones just don‚Äôt smell right and gave me a headache when burning.  Not sure if they changed the formula or something happened during storage/shipping because they look like they came melted.
3,27-May-18,5,Love Love Love I was never a big fan of lavender but I LOVE these products
3,26-Jan-17,1,BIG Disappointment. This candle smells nothing like lavender. Lavender smells clean. This candle smells cloyingly sweet - like grape jelly. Horrible. Will not purchase again.

3,21-Feb-17,1,"While I absolutely love Mrs. Meyers Soy Basil Candle and have owned ... While I absolutely love Mrs. Meyers Soy Basil Candle and have owned several before, I feel deceived by this product listing as the image makes it appear like you are reciving two of these candles. I was severely disappointed to find out that only one candle was in the package."
3,9-Jun-17,3,Three Stars Smelled ok
3,26-Apr-17,2,"Broken  during shipping, otherwise great I love love love the way these smell, clean and fresh. Unfortunately, one of these was broken during shipment! Boo! I happened to have another of these candles almost empty, so I took the candle putt of the glass shards and  was able to salvage it."
3,4-Jun-17,5,Five Stars Best candles ever.  Very nice fragrance.
3,19-Jul-17,1,Upset My candles came completely shattered! I'm so disappointed. What can be done for this?

3,20-Feb-17,5,Great Value This is my favorite scent...I usually stock up whenever I go to target. But these were listed at an unbeatable price!
3,21-Mar-17,5,Five Stars Lasts a long time and subtle!
3,29-Jul-17,1,Didn't give me what I paid for Ordered lavender and was given two geranium scented candles. Hate the smell. Very annoyed.
3,25-Dec-17,1,Gave this as a gift and when I opened it ... Gave this as a gift and when I opened it one of the jars were badly broken. Can you replace just one?
3,20-Jan-20,5,"Great deal, great scent! Lasted quite awhile... Bought this two pack to use as small gifts for Christmas. They both came together in a plain brown box, so I opened the box in order to gift them to two different people. Could smell the Lavender scent through the packaging ‚Äî impressive! My aunt loved hers and said it lasted quite a while, with a pleasant scent. Love the jar that they come in. Buying the two pack was a great deal, as these are usually $10 on their own at big brand stores."
3,12-Aug-19,5,"just what I needed Smells wonderfully clean and actually fills a moderate size room. This is my first experience with this brand of candle, and this scent in particular. I would re order this candle if found at a good price again. I made this purchase as a deal of the day or something like that .. so it was easy to ""try"" something ""new"". Have no worries, it's a great candle, seems to be burning evenly and cleanly. So far, so good ."
3,30-Aug-20,3,FRAGRANCE LONGEVITY??????? In reading the reviews I figured Hey these must be Awesome. They said the fragrance last and would have longevity. But I haven't experienced that yet. I started burning it as soon as a received it. Nothing yet 3hrs in.
3,11-Jul-17,1,"Where is the Lavender? These candles do NOT smell like lavender AT ALL. I don't understand why they claim it is lavender when literally, it just smells like some fruity scent. I am highly disappointed and I can't even return it. (To no fault of Meyers on the returning part, it is their fault for false advertising)."
3,1-Jul-17,1,"i've continued to buy them because i loved it, but most recent purchase set me to ... i've never had a problem with these candles until my most recent purchase. i've continued to buy them because i loved it, but most recent purchase set me to never buy them again. it burnt halfway the candles just fine, until the wick runs out and i'm left with the other half of the bottle unused. i've tried many times to get it to light without the wick but failed. i don't know why the wick stops mid point. does not make sense. i should be able to use the entire candle but unfortunately unable to. never buying these again."
3,24-Sep-20,5,"Worth it I‚Äôm a candle freak and know to burn them long enough so they don‚Äôt tunnel. And if I don‚Äôt burn them long enough I scrape down the sides. I figured anyone saying the sides don‚Äôt burn just don‚Äôt know how to properly use candles. However, in this two pack I had one burn beautifully and the other simply would not melt the sides. They smell strong for such a small candle though and I will be buying again. Good purchase."
3,26-Dec-19,5,"Clean smell Got these as a quick add on to my cart and they are amazing! You don't have to light these to get the scent from them,  just open the lid.  It isn't so strong that it gives you a headache,  but it will fil the house with scent.  And it smells so clean!"
3,29-Jun-19,3,"not really a lavender smell I bought one, and then brought two more, before burning it.  Mistake.  It is a pleasant smell, but not very much like the other lavender that I have.  Wish i had not bought them."
3,1-Jan-20,5,"Frequent purchase This candle is inexpensive, smells great and last for a long time. Smell is not to overpowering and very pleasant. Can be used in any room to help with odors"
3,29-Jul-17,1,It's not even close to a nice smell of Lavender Im am returning this product! It's not even close to a nice smell of Lavender! Very disappointed !!
3,18-Mar-17,4,"Great candles, smells great! I usually use candles to ward off the smell that cooking food leaves behind, and these candles does the job perfectly. The reason I gave four stars and not five is cuz almost half  to a whole inch of soy wax goes waste. The wick doesn't burn completely to the end. Apart from this, I love the candles and m going to try the other fragrances."
3,20-Sep-17,5,"Wick is not long enough but i love the Lavendar scent I love these candles...they're made of soy and don't make me cough like the cheap glade ones. However, I hate that the candle doesn't burn all the way to the bottom. There's always at least an inch left in the candle...seems like such a huge waste throwing a perfectly good candle away just because there's no more wick."
3,6-Dec-19,5,Good fragrance Bought these during a flash deal on a whim.These smell so good I don't/didn't need to light them.
3,26-Nov-17,1,Headaches and Nauseau Though Mrs Meyers advertises itself as a more natural candle they do use synthetic scents which for those with allergies or respitory problems can be triggering. These candles give me terrible headaches and nausea. Buy something natural! Don‚Äôt bother with these! They‚Äôre actually bad for your health.
3,4-Aug-19,3,Long lasting You have to get pretty close to enjoy the lavender scent of this candle when it is lit. It does last for a decent amount of time though.
3,26-Aug-19,5,LOVE these candles I love the Lavender scent of these candles. So fresh and leaves a lovely smell in our home to mask the new-puppy odors! I just wish they did not burn so quickly!
3,23-Jun-17,4,"They certainly smell different than a typical candle and I really enjoy their earthy I would call these an acquired smell. They certainly smell different than a typical candle and I really enjoy their earthy, woody smell. A great choice if you want something other than a floral smell. The smell isn't overpowering but it certainly lingers long after the candle is no longer burning."
3,15-Feb-18,1,Smelled terrible Terrible smell. Returned for refund.
3,20-Jan-20,3,Delicious scent; sloppy presentation The scent was great! The candles inside the jar had been melted and lost it‚Äôs clean candle appearance. I had to dig the wick out of them.
3,8-Jan-19,5,"Great Smell Gave as a gift; can't speak to how well they burn,but the lavender smells awesome!Peace."
3,15-Mar-20,1,Disappointing OBSESSED with the basil scented products so I was quite disappointed when I lit this candle only to find that it smells more like soy rather than the basil scent I love. Definitely pass on this if you have high hopes for a truly scented candle.
3,17-Aug-19,5,Great sent. These are wonderful smelling candles.
3,11-Jan-20,5,Lasts awhile! Smells nice but not overpowering Love the scent. Not overpowering!
3,21-Oct-20,5,Scented candles Item exactly as described and great item for the price.  Received my order in a very timely manner.
3,23-Feb-20,5,Perfectly perfect! Perfect!
3,7-Jan-20,5,Fire Came as described. Smell great.
3,2-Feb-19,5,"Nice scent Love these- look cool, smell great and burns well"
3,22-Nov-20,5,Smells amazing! Smells amazing! My favorite candle. Not too overpowering and it‚Äôs a very relaxing scent. I like to sleep with one burning for deep relaxation.
3,8-May-20,5,We love mrs. meyer‚Äôs! Great candles
3,20-Dec-19,5,Very clean burning and fragrant candles I was very pleased with this suggestion by one of the customer service reps fantastic product
3,20-Dec-18,5,Amazing buy! Great soy candle.  Smells great!
3,1-Oct-20,2,Not worth it I‚Äôm frustrated these small candles are $10 they don‚Äôt smell like anything and barley burn
3,18-Dec-19,1,Bad Smell Bought these on a lighting deal for myself but ended up giving them away - Really bad smell. Had to hide them in a different room to keep my allergies from reacting. Would not recommend.
3,14-Jan-20,5,Great Great! Strong scent spreads.
3,3-May-19,5,"Wonderful scent! Wonderful scent, very relaxing, wish they lasted longer though!"
3,13-Oct-17,1,Not lavender scented whatsoever This candle smells nothing like lavender. If you‚Äôre looking for a lavender smelling candle don‚Äôt buy this one. The smell is almost too sweet. It made me sick and gave me a headache.
3,3-Jan-20,5,Love them Yummy
3,5-Jul-18,3,"Smells good, but not very fragrant I love this scent of soap so I was really excited to find out they had candles too! It smells great up close but I was disappointed by the lack of fragrance. Walking into the room, you couldn‚Äôt tell a candle was even being burnt. Disappointing because I love how light & fresh this scent is!"
3,1-Mar-19,5,Candle has long burning life. Wonder smell throughout house from 1 candle.
3,26-Dec-17,5,Best Candle Always gonna love this
3,11-May-20,1,Candles Very upset product came broken ! Would like replacement
3,14-Dec-19,1,UNHEALTHY CHEMICALS IN THE FRAGRANCE They use chemical fragrances that are very unhealthy.
3,9-May-20,5,"Great! Smells great, probably will be getting more scents."
3,1-Mar-19,5,"Great candle! These are great basic candles, the glass jars look nice and the scent is very pleasant."
3,19-May-17,5,Smells great. I did not know if I would like this candle. Turns out that I really love the scent.
3,2-Feb-20,1,Smells gross Does not smell anything like lavender.
3,31-Jan-20,1,Delivery issue Item (glass) was broken upon arrival.
3,15-Jul-19,1,"Small jar with no lasting scent Did not last, overpriced"
3,7-Jul-19,5,Best Smell Ever! My favorite candle ever! Smells AMAZING.
3,22-Mar-20,5,Great candle Excellent product.
3,29-Mar-17,5,"These burn so well and smell divine. Fresh and ... These burn so well and smell divine. Fresh and clean, without being overpowering. Amazon's price point per oz. is significantly less than Target where I was buying them. These are a staple in my household."
3,6-Jan-19,5,Smells great Smells great
3,10-Aug-17,3,Three Stars Doesn't really smell once burning. Was hoping for more of a pleasant scent.
3,18-Mar-17,1,Missing one This states it is TWO candles but I only got one!
3,26-Jan-17,4,"7.2 oz EACH so small, not large! I thought they were going to be 14.4 oz each but that is total between the two... still love the smell and the product just disappointed with the size"
3,20-Jul-17,5,Five Stars Perfect!
3,3-Mar-17,1,"Very disappointed. Love the candle, but extremely upset that I paid for TWO candles and only received one."
3,11-Aug-17,3,"Nice candles, but wasteful. Need longer wicks - 20% of candle is useless. So I've bought these candles more than once and both times really liked them  (although the smells were slightly different on different purchases). The major complaint is 20% of the candle is useless - they waste about an inch worth of the candle. The wicks are not on the bottom of the jar so they don't burn all the way down (see pics).  At first, we thought this was just one candle, but it's happened on each one we've bought.  I guess if you're artsy/craftsy and want to make candles you could melt the remaining wax from five candles, buy wick on Amazon and make a new candle (buy 5 + wick + time = get one free?) but that's not what I thought I was were signing up for.REALLY liked these from Kobo candles¬†  ¬†the wick goes all the way down to the bottom (and the empty jars are both great rocks glasses and holders for tea lights) but they're way too expensive."
3,24-Dec-17,2,"Disappointing :( Maybe my fault, but I was thinking this candle would smell like actual lavender, but I think it‚Äôs meant to smell like lavender cleaning supplies, because that is what it smells like. I personally think the smell is atrocious. Also, (though I guess this has worked out in my favor since I hate the smell) the candle smell doesn‚Äôt burn very strongly/travel far."
3,11-Feb-17,4,"Pleasant and clean smelling.  Not lavender scent but nice anyways. I fell in love with these candles after first falling in love with the Mrs. Meyer's dish soap in this same scent.  I agree it does not smell like lavender but I really like the mild, clean smell that this is.  It's not an overbearing scent and it does not give me a headache like most candles and scents do. It's just pleasant and clean smelling. I couldn't find these bigger ounce candles in the store, so I'm happy to have found them here."
3,7-Jan-18,1,"Not Lavender. I don't know what this scent is, but it is NOT lavender.  It smells soapy, a bit like citrus 'scented' soap with a vague, herbal-type quality.  When I unscrewed the top, nothing more, and left it open the scent filled the whole end of the house.  Once it aired, I found the scent milder.  After 1/2 day of burning, I find the throw diminishing.PROS:  The scent softens, and is quite distinctive.  The set seems to be a good value;  after 6 hours of burning, it seems to be barely touched.  The throw is appropriate (after the initial blast) for one to two rooms.CONS: It is not lavender.  It is NOT lavender.  IT IS NOT A LAVENDER CANDLE. It SAYS it is lavender.  But its not. And I was trying to buy a lavender candle.My score is one star:  one for the value, good burn time and decent throw.  Four stars off because it is NOT lavender scented, although it is advertised as such.  If it were advertised as 'Clean Soap Scent' then that would be fair.UPDATE: I burned both candles a few days ago to brighten a little-used room.  I realized when I walked into the room that I just hated the scent.  It is so far away from lavender as to be unrecognizable.  I decided life is short; I no longer want to try to make these work.  They ended in the trash, a complete waste of my money.  Others might like them; that is certainly a possibility.  I absolutely hate the smell and this experience has soured me from trying any more Mrs. Meyers products."
3,9-Dec-18,2,"A disservice to the Mrs Meyers brand name I like Mrs Meyers Clean Day Basil Concentrate.  So much so that I receive 4 bottles a month on subscribe and save.  This candle product, by comparison, is very underwhelming.  The scent is underpowered and different than the other ""basil"" products.Let's put it this way.  No one who starts with this candle would move on to later buy Mrs Meyers cleaning products.  People only buy this based on their experience with the cleaning products.Save your money.  I predict a ""new and improved"" version at some point.  I'll try again when that happens.I'll give it 2 stars and not 1 because it's not nauseating.  It just under delivers on its promise."
3,15-Mar-19,4,"Nice scent. Nice scent even though, strictly speaking I wouldn't call it a lavender scent.  Got lots of favorable comments on it  ... ""Your house always smells so good!"" sort of thing.  The scent does linger, you don't have to be burning the candle for it to be doing its job.  One star taken off because the wicks are often too short, and leave as much as one inch of candle left with no way to burn it.  So I really don't think I'm getting the full 35 hours!"
3,22-May-20,3,"Smells like apples The package and overall product arrived in perfect condition, however, the candles smell nothing like lavender. I‚Äôm definitely getting a very sweet apple vibe. Usually I‚Äôm a fan of Mrs. Meyers products but this scent isn‚Äôt for me. Side note: I also bought these in the lemon verbena and they smell great. These candles burn very clean but don‚Äôt last as long as other soy blends."
3,4-Jun-20,4,High quality scent. Great price I love this budget conscious candle. I love anything by Mrs Meyers.The reason it‚Äôs only 4 stars is because it doesn‚Äôt burn evenly. I buy high quality candles that burn evenly each and every time.But I still love this candle because it‚Äôs a great value and burns well enough and it smells fantastic. The scent smells just as good as high cost candles
3,16-Apr-17,5,"Exactly What You Want I love these candles, I order a new set every few weeks (in different scents). The scents don't smell artificial and they're neither overpowering nor weak. As long as you fasten the top when not in use, the candle doesn't seem to lose its scent over time. The advertised burn time seems realistic but I've never really timed it. Overall a very solid scented candle.If you're unsure about one scent versus another, I would say that it just comes down to preference--I've ordered 4 or 5 different scents of these and no single scent was superior to another in terms of quality."
3,6-Mar-20,2,"No smell, save it for a power outage I purchased this candle because I absolutely love the smell of their cleaning products. This candle almost has no smell at all. I don‚Äôt even smell the cleaning product it is to mimic at all.  I love  a Yankee, Glade, Bath & Body works candle because the smell captures the entire room. I will be sticking to them. If your looking for a candle for a smell this is not your candle, could use it if the lights go out."
3,29-Oct-20,2,"Not for me, but still a quality product I absolutely love this basil scent in my Mrs. meyers cleaning products, but I can‚Äôt stand this candle. It‚Äôs not the same clean scent to me. This is just my opinion so other folks may really enjoy it, but I wish that I had smelled the candle before I purchased it, let alone purchased 2 (again, that‚Äôs totally my fault). Otherwise, it burns for a long time and looks really nice."
3,18-Nov-18,3,"Did not smell of lavender ConsConsIt has an extra sweet smell, which did not appeal to my senses.It did not smell of lavender and I love lavender. I prefer their lemon one.It is not giftable.  Both bottles had a tiny smudge on the wax. It is for personal use so I don't care.ProsThese are large jars. Meyers candles last long and they inform you the ingredients. I will keep buying Meyers as long as they tell me what's in it."
3,22-Aug-18,3,Not Lavendar but not awful I‚Äôm pinching myself for not listening to the reviews. I fell in love with the Mrs. Meyers Basil scented candle but my husband isn‚Äôt a huge fan of the scent so I thought we could try something new. The lavendar smells like the strawberry cabbage patch doll that I had growing up. Don‚Äôt buy this expecting to smell any lavendar.
3,24-Sep-19,1,"These candles aren‚Äôt worth the price The candles look nice and the scent is good, but they don‚Äôt last long and they aren‚Äôt strong enough to give the room a good smell. I‚Äôll stick to the cheap candles. These aren‚Äôt worth the price."
3,2-Jun-20,1,"Super strong and gross scent I‚Äôm not a fan of this candle. The lavender scent is extremely powerful and I can‚Äôt have it lit for more than 10 minutes without feeling sick. I loooove the scent of lavender, so I‚Äôm pretty upset that these aren‚Äôt worth purchasing :/ I use Mrs.Meyer hand and dish soap, but the candles are too much."
3,6-Jun-20,2,doesnt last as long as advertised The lavender scent smells nice. Burn time was listed at 35 hours... I would say it is more in the range of 20 hours. I light for about 2 hours at a time and lit it no more than 10 times. One of the candles wick even broke towards the bottom so 1/2 inch of wax was wasted..
3,16-Oct-18,2,Smell great but do not burn to the bottom . . . so you are not getting what you pay for and these candles are pricey. Mrs. Meyer's has always been more expensive than everyone else. I didn't buy them for years after contacting the company about a problem and they literally didn't care whatsoever. No customer service is available at all with this company They are terrible.  So it's doubtful they would care that their candles only burn 3/4 the way through.
3,8-Sep-17,5,"Delivers Let's face it, all these candles on Amazon are over-priced, Prime or not. At least this one delivers. It smells good and burns a long time at a reasonable flame level (provided you TRIM it). Soy is renewable, and melts at a lower temperature, so you don't get those giant chunks of wax on the side of the container like paraffin. Five star value compared to the rest of the pack."
3,21-Apr-20,5,Kid approved Bought these for my kids for Christmas and both of them said they really liked them. That the smell was really good.I felt good about getting them for my children because I wanted safe non toxic in their homes.
3,20-Apr-20,5,"Safe, clean, re-useable/ recyclable packaging I love Mrs Meyers products, and these candles are no exception.  Clean burning, very long lasting, very lightly scented candle in a re-useable, recyclable glass jar with a metal lid (NO PLASTIC!).  My Mrs. Meyers candle burns all day  until I go to sleep during Covid-19 lockdown, to remind me of  the bright, clear  persistence of life."
3,2-Jan-20,1,"Big no for me! These smell terrible! I hate leaving bad reviews and some people might enjoy them. For me the lavender scent was not an authentic lavender smell. So, if you want that true lavender smell, do not purchase these. I actually threw both of them away after trying them twice."
3,11-Mar-19,5,"Highly Recommend These are great candles.  The price is exceptional and you get 2 candles.  I thought the lavender smells was too pungent and I love the smell of lavender.  They offer several fragrances to choose from.  Otherwise, I highly recommend."
3,12-Mar-20,1,"After burning, you get to keep about an inch of wax Do you like paying $10 for a small candle that doesn‚Äôt burn all the way through? I‚Äôve had these candles and another scent from the same brand and they all die with about an inch of wax left to burn before the wick dies. It‚Äôs not that much but knowing I paid about $10/ 7.2oz candle makes it really annoying to see that much wax go to waste. Don‚Äôt buy."
3,17-May-20,5,Best Smelling Candle Ever Love the smell of lavender and Mrs. Meyer's scent is the best of them all. Can't live without it honestly. Fills the room! Wish they'd be bigger and last longer but I'll happily keep buying them since they smell so amazing.
3,29-Dec-19,5,Quality you expect Love these! Lavender is my favorite scent and these are used regular with our weekly yoga session. My friends raved! The scent is truly lavender without being sickeningly floral. Love this brand and trust their products!
3,5-Feb-20,4,Not a saving I bought these because they are my fav and the price is better from here but the first one was perfect and then the second one was so weak and did not even smell like lavender so really I did not save at all .
3,3-Jun-20,5,Amazing smell I love this scent in all their products so much I got the candles. Great value when brought as part of the subscribe and save program. Don‚Äôt last a really long time but long enough. Wish they came in a bigger 3 wick
3,22-Nov-19,4,"Love but I only buy these candles now since they smell wonderful and they last a while and cruelty free the only thing that bothers me is that it it doesnt waste everything, like it doesnt burn/use up all the wax like other candles do."
3,16-Jul-20,5,"Basil Fresh I dislike cloying, overpowering scents. These smell really fresh and non-synthetic. The throw is decent, and I like to use them after a dirty diaper to freshen up the atmosphere."
3,30-Jan-17,2,"Doesn't Smell Like Lavender I really wanted a soy candle that smelled like lavender. This candle does not. I can't describe the smell, but it gives me a headache sadly. I was hoping for lavender essential oil in a candle, basically."
3,12-Jan-19,4,I was actually impressed with how much scent comes out of this little candle I wish I would of chosen a different scent but it wasn't bad.  Just wasn't wow and I have a feeling it could be a wow if I would of chosen a different scent.  They're just so expensive that I can't see myself buying one without a discount.  I bought them when they were on sale.
3,27-Jul-19,3,Just ok and wasteful This candle is just ok. The smell is alright but not a true lavender scent. It smells exactly like the hand soap and it also leaves a couple inches of unmelted wax on the bottom when it dies. It says it‚Äôs king burning but I had quite a few issues with it burning evenly.
3,24-Sep-20,4,"nice! These candles are lovely, and smell great.  However, they don't last more than half a dozen uses, and I like to light them for an hour or two every evening."
3,2-Oct-20,1,"Cheap perfume smell Smell is too much like a cheap perfume.  As soon as I opened the jar, the smell was strong. It did not smell like lavender- just strong bad perfume."
3,20-Apr-20,1,"Not a pleasant fragrance I've purchased Mrs. Meyer's Lemon/Verbena Soy Candles-they are a delight.This lavender-NOT SO MUCH!  Very poor-will return. I like the presentation but I gave 5 stars for longevity simply because I would not burn it, it would sit on a shelf FOREVER"
3,7-Oct-19,2,Not good. Too expensive.Not a strong enough scent.Burns too quickly.
3,30-Sep-20,1,One came with glass broke. I enjoy the scent but 1 candle came broken. Have not tried to light the non broken candle yet but I do like the aroma right out of the box.
3,16-Jul-19,2,"Smell is not strong! I believed all the ""Mrs. Meyers"" hype and spent the money on these.  Up close the smell is nice but stand two feet away and you wouldn't notice a thing.  These are very small and definitely not worth the money, you are paying for the name and that's it."
3,5-Nov-18,5,"Smells like grass I recently got into Mrs. Meyer's Basil line, so I knew I had to purchase these candles.To my surprise, they don't smell so much like basil (at least, not to my untrained nose, and they don't smell like the Basil line's distinctive basil smell)- they smell like freshly cut grass!!!Honestly, I like that scent as well, so I'm alright with it. I light them every night to help relax."
3,4-Apr-20,1,Terrible smell I like all other Meyer's products - but these candles smell terrible. Of course smell is subjective but this doesn't smell anything like Lavender.
3,24-May-20,3,Ok... Overpriced you‚Äôd be better off grabbing some from your local Kroger or Walmart. The scent really wasn‚Äôt that great but hey you be the judge of that !
3,11-Jun-18,1,"Cannot use The smell of the lavender was awful with the lid off unlit and with the candle lit. I thought lighting it might make it better, but no. I bought the pair and unfortunately I cannot use either."
3,16-Aug-20,1,Only got one in the package Only got one candle in the package.  The pack was clearly meant to have two candles but it only had one even though it was sealed.
3,2-Jun-20,1,"Negligent packaging for a glass enclosed pair of candles. Smells great, but glass broken into a gazillion pieces. Shipped in a box with no cushion packaging. Would have been a great pair of candles without the broken glass."
3,10-Sep-20,4,"Satisfied I wish the scent was a little stronger, but everything else is A+ and it looks like it will last a long time.  Well done.  For the price, hard to beat."
3,9-Oct-19,2,they don't smell like anything The whole point of scented candles is to mask other smells but these are so weak they don't do anything.
3,17-Jul-20,3,They ok These candles smell a little synthetic and they give me a headache. Not my favorite but they go get rid of strong smells.
3,7-May-19,1,"Horrible scent! This smells Nothing like Lavender, extremely disappointing!  Mrs. Meyers needs to discontinue making this candle.I ended up having to air out my house after burning this candle for just 10 minutes to get rid of the powerful ""fake candle"" smell.Wax is very high quality, this is the only positive comment I can make about this candle."
3,28-May-20,1,"Don't waste your money I love all Meyers products but this one I was very disappointed.  The lavender didn't even smell, the candle didn't last long .  Very disappointed will not buy again there are to many candles on the market not to waste your money on these."
3,4-May-20,2,Overwhelming I don‚Äôt like the smell. The smell is also super intense and I have to blow it out so it isn‚Äôt overwhelming.
3,19-Sep-20,5,"A fragrance favorite in a clean burning candle Clean burning, fabulous fragrance. I‚Äôve purchased multiple times for my own home and for gifting. Always a favorite!"
3,28-Dec-19,1,Doesn't smell like the bar soap I loved the way the bar soap smelled. Even after taking a shower the scent could be smelled in the bathroom. I am disappointed that the candle doesn't smell like the soap.
3,19-Feb-20,5,Very strong scent. I really like the scent and how well it fills a room quickly to cover yucky smells (especially diaper and cooking smells)
3,6-Mar-18,5,"This candle smells more like lemon to me-definitely not lavender but I absolutely LOVE ... This candle smells more like lemon to me-definitely not lavender but I absolutely LOVE the smell and the cute jar. Even when it is not burning, the scent remains in the room. I am addicted to this candle. I want to try other scents but I love this one so much that I don't want to stray. I would highly recommend."
3,1-Apr-20,1,Not a good candle So disappointed in this. They did not give out any aroma and I lit it one evening and literally after burning it for five hours it was completely gone.
3,24-May-18,5,The scent is amazing. It smells exactly like their dish soap and ... The scent is amazing. It smells exactly like their dish soap and cleaner. It burns way cleaner than any other candles I've ever used no black chunks while burning). and it lasts a lot longer as well. I burned this candle for about 6 hours last night and only about a centimeter of wax was gone.
3,2-Aug-19,1,"Doesn't smell like lavender. Can't identify what scent this actually is, but it doesn't smell anything like lavender.  I don't like the scent at all.  I'm putting it in my rummage sale box."
3,4-Oct-17,3,"Doesn't smell like other Mrs Meyers basil products. I was a little disappointed in this product, I love Mrs. Meyers basil scented products but unfortunately this doesn't smell like those. It's kind of similar, but not the same. It's a quality candle and produces a strong scent, just not the one I was looking form."
3,26-Mar-17,5,"Love the fragrance Love the fragrance. It does not leave notes of petroleum in the air like other candles, and this is one of the reasons I like these candles."
3,9-Oct-20,1,"Would not reccomend Candles are extremely strong smelling and synthetic. Lavender does not smell like lavender and my entire house which is quite large, reeked of the smell after ten minutes. Not sure how the reviews are so positive on this product but I will be looking for a refund from amazon."
3,20-Nov-20,5,Smells good and nice quality. Adds a nice smell like all the Mrs Meyers products.  I wish they had more scent options.
3,3-Oct-19,5,Smells wonderful Great candles. Would purchase again.
3,24-Nov-18,5,great scent & last a long time A wonderful candle that is lasting quite a long time. Price is amazing too. Very pleased - will buy more for sure! Took the top off of 2nd one & put in bathroom til I need it. Smells great even without being lit.
3,14-Sep-19,5,"The best candle ever! The most amazing candles ever!  They are long lasting, smell great, and do a much better job and reducing odors than anything on the market!"
3,16-Aug-20,3,Strong sccent I think the scent is very strong.  I am sensitive to smells however so may just be me.
3,24-Feb-18,5,The best! Love these products. Great scents. Good value. I have been disappointed by so many more expensive brands. These scents brighten my spirits and make my home smell lovely.
3,6-Jun-20,3,Smell lovely but not a good value Loooove these scents so much that I still buy them even though they leave so much unused wax once the wick is done. Might buy my own wicks and repurpose all that extra wax.
3,14-Feb-20,5,"My favorite! The scent is wonderful. It smells clean. It doesn‚Äôt look visibly impressive but the quality is great! I order 4 of these candles, in 2-packs, every month on my Subscribe & Save."
3,20-Dec-18,3,"Unsubscribe. ??_?? subscribe and save member ; candle jar was broken upon arrival...Charged for return shipping.Unsubscribe.Honestly the ""Mrs. Meyers"" candles I buy from Publix last longer...Unsubscribe."
3,8-May-20,3,"Smells good - when you catch a rare wiff of it Smells good, when you catch a wiff of it. I burn it for several hours at a time and you wouldn't know it by smell."
3,13-Apr-18,3,The lavender smells like a cheap oil The lavender smells like a cheap oil. I've used cheap essential Oils and really high quality ones and the scent of this candle is definitely more of cheap scent. I can only burn it for a short amount of time before I'm just done with it.
3,14-Aug-17,5,Favorite candles! I always like to have candles lit in my apartment and these have been my favorite of the year! I keep reordering because they smell so good and are a great value for how much burn time I can get from them for the money. They make my apartment smell like a spa or yoga studio which is ideal when owning a cat in a small space.
3,29-Mar-20,5,"LOVE, Love, love Let these candles burn for about 30-45 mins and your whole house will smell divine ! ! Mrs. Meyers everything :)"
3,12-Sep-19,5,Smells so nice I love these candles.They never disappoint.We just moved and these easily conquered the new paint smell.

3,18-Dec-18,5,Love Mrs. Meyers products Love Mrs. Meyers products and this is no exception. Clean burning soy candle in a nice glass that can be reused. Basil is one of my favorite Mrs. Meyers scents. Bought one for myself and one for a gift.
3,24-Sep-20,1,Didn't like the smell This doesn't smell like lavender.  It smells like chemicals.
3,10-Dec-17,5,"The smell is even better in a candle The smell is even better in a candle. I did expect them to be a little larger for the price, but other than that i am happy with these candles. They were shipped in one day! Who can complain about that?"
3,17-Oct-17,5,"but that is why I love it. Put it in a large room and ... This particular fragrance is my fav of Mrs. Meyers.  It is a very very strong candle scent, but that is why I love it. Put it in a large room and the entire house is enveloped with this nice smell.  Will be buying more for Christmas gifts"
3,15-Mar-19,4,"Smells good, not 35 hours Smells good, not 35 hours.. 20-ish."
3,8-Jun-18,1,"Very disappointing When lit, the candle smells awful. It's more of a burnt lavender smell. I can't use these.. I love the hand soap."
3,25-Mar-18,5,"I LOVE this scent from Mrs I LOVE this scent from Mrs. Meyer's. (We also have the room spray) These candles burn for a long time and the scent is strong without being overbearing. Even when not lit, I can smell the candles when I walk into the room."
3,27-Oct-18,5,"My favorite candle! These lavender candles smell amazing, not overpowering. The house smells wonderful, light and relaxing. These have a long burn time and I will definitely be purchasing again."
3,14-Aug-19,1,"Both Lids Dented When I received my order both the candle lids were dented.  I was going to use them as a gift, but can't now."
3,11-Feb-18,5,"Nice scent, long lasting Love the basil smell from Mrs Meyers. These candles are rather long lasting. I burn both at the same time. Slight scent but not very strong and definitely not overpowering"
3,10-Jan-20,5,Smells so good! I love these candles. Clean powerful scent. I keep ordering them.
3,11-Sep-19,5,Lovely! I love these candles! love the smell!! Mrs. Meyers products are always high quality and i wasn't disappointed!!
3,3-Sep-18,5,Beautiful pleasant scent! Last a very long time! I love this candle and this scent. It is very pleasant and light but potent if that makes sense. It uplifts the mood and the feeling of a calm atmosphere. I will purchase more!
3,26-Jan-20,5,"Love!!! My absolute favorite and buy these almost weekly. Smell is amazing, not overly powerful but gentle. Works great for someone who is sensitive to smells."
3,22-Sep-18,3,Cute Candle but Fake Smell We just don‚Äôt care for the smell - it smells like a cleaner with a fake lavender scent. I was surprised that so many reviewers love this scent. It‚Äôs not lavender to me.
3,8-Jun-17,3,I liked the scent but didn't like that the wick isn't ... I liked the scent but didn't like that the wick isn't an all cotton wick. There is a metal wire in the center of the wick.
3,24-Apr-20,2,Ok but not a great scent Doesn‚Äôt smell very clean to me
3,16-Apr-20,1,Waste wax Candle doesn‚Äôt burn all the way to the bottom of the jar. Waste a lot of wax

3,2-Oct-17,5,i LOVE this scent of Mrs i LOVE this scent of Mrs. Meyers. This has become my favorite candle! Better than Yanke to Bath and Body. I can't believe such a small candle has such a strong scent. Absolutely love this.
3,7-May-20,3,"Candles The smell is making me a little sick but, the candle does last for a very long time!!! Nice size and value for my money. The 1 candle alone at the store cost close to $9"
3,7-Feb-20,5,"Best lavender candle! I really love these candles.  The scent is lovely and always the same, this is my go-to candle. And it burns a long time"
3,20-Jan-20,5,My wife loves these candles. My wife loves these very nice pleasant scent.
3,20-Mar-18,3,"PRICE IS FOR ONE CANDLE or we got ripped off Love the scent but it is clearly pictured as two candles and we only received one. I double checked and it's also an answered question on the page that it IS SUPPOSED to be 2 candles for that price, I also checked the other scents that show 2 candles for the SAME price and sure enough...it's for two candles. We got ripped off."
3,3-Nov-19,3,Not worth it It does not really fill a room with the expected smell. Also gets used up faster than expected
3,3-May-17,5,"Best candles ever!!!!! Best candles I've ever used!!!  The scent is light & clean.  They're also soy which means they burn better & cleaner.  I have these on subscribe & save, love love love!!!"

3,20-Jun-17,5,Great scent! Love this soy candle. The lavender is great. It's the only scent I actually like from Mrs. Meyers
3,30-May-18,4,"These are great long lasting candles These are great long lasting candles. I will, however, say that the lavender scent is not exactly what I think of when I think lavender. Has more of a cleaning product smell to it."
3,23-Sep-19,2,"Fake smell It's a strong candle. Fake lavender smell. Does not say ""relaxation"" - says ""I am drowning in a pool of lavender"""
3,16-Jun-18,5,"I really like these. The soy candles burn longer and the ... I really like these.  The soy candles burn longer and the scents have much more ""staying power"" than traditional candles.  It's worth the extra $$$ you pay."

3,19-Jan-20,3,"Okay Scent was okay, a bit nauseating at times."

3,30-Apr-18,5,"The larger size Mrs Meyer's candles are great. Burning this candle in a central location of ... The larger size Mrs Meyer's candles are great. Burning this candle in a central location of a 750sqft flat pleasantly odorizes the entire space. Excellent for bathrooms, too. Love."

3,15-Jul-18,3,"Not lavender scent Specifically bought these for a lavender scent, so was a bit disappointed to see it was not lavender scented.It did have a nice scent... so maybe it would work for others."
3,23-Apr-20,3,Getting more expensive by the minute I like the scent though it‚Äôs not your typical lavender. But it does not burn a full 35 hours like it says and they‚Äôve raised the prices twice in the last month....
3,20-Apr-19,5,Beautifully scented This is my favorite lavender scented candle. The scent is very natural.
3,14-Feb-19,5,Smells so oooh good Smells soooooo good. Gave to my daughters as part of Christmas gift and they loved it
3,10-Nov-18,5,"Soft Fragrance and Even Burn The Basil scent is soft and the soy wax burn evenly. For a long lasting and even burn, trim the candle wick down and burn the candle for at least two hours."
3,3-Jan-20,5,Very nice Nice smell
3,8-Mar-19,4,Very strong scent The scent is a little too strong for me -- and I like strong candles normally.

3,17-Feb-17,5,"So nice to not have black smoke billowing out from a candle to pollute the air! So nice to not have black smoke billowing out from a candle to pollute the air! They could use a little more along the lines of being more aromatic, however. They burn long and also can be used for storage afterwards."
3,1-Aug-17,5,"Love Mrs. Meyers products, use very many Great products from Mrs. Meyers."

3,3-Jan-18,5,Mrs. Meyers never disappoints! Best bathroom candle ever!
3,15-Apr-17,4,Smells nice but expensive This is the best lavender scent I've had in a candle. It's a bit expensive though and the burn hours are not that long.
3,1-Apr-18,5,"Not Overpowering Mrs. Meyer‚Äôs are some of my favorite candles ever because they‚Äôre long lasting and have a scent that permeates the room without being overpowering. I have asthma and can be pretty sensitive to air fresheners and other heavily scented things, but these do not bother me at all. As someone who has trouble sleeping, I find that the lavender scented ones are great for my bedroom. Not only does the lavender help to make us actually sleepy and more relaxed, the candle helps neutralize stale air during the winter months when it‚Äôs too cold to open the windows and air out the bedrooms. (Don‚Äôt pretend like you don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm talking about.)"
3,18-Jun-18,1,One Star They smell terrible and not at all like basil.
3,20-Mar-18,5,"Five Stars LOVE THESE CANDLES, MAKES MY HOUSE SMELL SO GOOD"
3,2-Nov-17,5,Five Stars Beautiful
3,13-Mar-18,3,I love the scent however these candles don't really smell like ... The scent is not as strong as the hand soap. I love the scent however these candles don't really smell like anything.
3,5-Apr-17,5,Five Stars amazing smell!!
3,21-Aug-17,2,Two Stars These don't smell like lavender. The scent is nice enough but is definitely not lavender.
3,7-Apr-18,5,Five Stars Smells great!
3,27-May-18,5,Five Stars best smell!
3,21-Feb-17,4,"Four Stars It's smells exactly like their cleaner, that just isn't what I hoped for out of the candle."
3,28-Oct-17,4,Four Stars Soy candles are the best!
3,5-Aug-17,5,Five Stars These smell great! One of my new favorite candles.
3,9-Aug-17,5,Five Stars Clean and subtle smelling candle.
3,15-Mar-17,3,Three Stars I love this smell after I've cleaned but burning the candle does not produce a strong scent.
3,27-May-17,5,Five Stars Smells great
3,11-May-17,1,"I love Mrs Meyers products I love Mrs Meyers products.  I have the hand soap, hand lotion, multi-surface spray, and dish soap.  This smells like kerosene with a sweet, nauseating undertone."
3,24-Dec-16,5,Lavender smells great Smell just like lavender. Last a good while although they are in a rather short glass container.
3,14-Sep-17,2,"Two Stars bad packaging, the candles were broken, pieces of glass throughout"
3,9-May-17,4,Candles My favorite candles. They are soy and actually make the room smell good. I burn candles a lot and these last about a week.
3,2-May-17,2,"Best description I can give is that it smells like ... We burn Mrs. Meyers candles in office daily (Typically Geranium and/or Lavender scents). However, we decided to try a different one (Basil) and we were questioned several times about the scent of the office. Best description I can give is that it smells like a clean diaper. No one picked up on the ""Basil"" scent it was supposed to have. Too bad! :("
3,8-Sep-18,4,"READ FOR THE REAL & LIFE HACK DANG FIRST WANNA SAY - seriously one of the best smelling candles. I am a ‚Äúprime now‚Äù nut and also a lavender fanatic. When my boyfriend and I ran out of our *other* dishwashing liquid which we have been using for an eternity and buy in bulk (don‚Äôt worry this is still about the candle) we prime nowd the lavender scented dish soap because ours wasn‚Äôt available so using natural products I knew I could trust the brand. THAT BEING SAID: Holy heck, the smell of the dish soap was so good I had to prime now the candle and wOW phenomenal. LIFE HACK GUYS THAT I JUST THOUGHT OF- I have a little candle wax warmer so the scent is amazing (a little sweeter for those who like more subtle lavender scents) so I noticed the candle exploded the scent all through my apartment within minutes and blew it out and poured the hot wax into my plug-in wax warmer (life hack) and it still smells so good and expands its lifespan!! Definitely recommend - only reason I leave 4 stars is bc I got 1 candle same size for $7.39 on prime now - that‚Äôs $14.78 for 2 and it‚Äôs delivered same day for free.... so they‚Äôre definitely ripping you off here but hey trumps our president we are capitalists. I‚Äôm frugal tho, pourin that wax into my cute lil plug-in warmer to get the most out of it. Welcome to 2018 but still the freakin best smelling candle."
3,22-Jan-20,1,"Not a great smell This candle brings to mind a bouquet of 1950s perm chemicals, two day old unemptied ashtray, and just a meager waft of Fabuloso cleaning solution. And no, I'm not pregnant. Mrs Meyer's has some great subtle scents (lookin at you, Radish handsoap!), but this one is just too overpowering and not pleasant. Even used outdoors its pungency is way too pronounced. Recommend folks sniff elsewhere."
3,9-Sep-20,2,"Not worth it Both candles did not last as long, but the 2nd candle I used, the wick started to smoke and started to give me a headache. Also, these hardly had a scent."
3,10-Jan-20,5,"Fresh, clean scent NOT artificial I love these candles! Lavender is my favourite scent, and I hate candles that smell artificial. These candles have a fresh clean scent. My best friend even commented on how nice they smell, and has ordered some for herself!"
3,6-Dec-19,1,They smell horrible! The only issue I have with these candles is the smell.  It's horrible and they do not smell like lavender.  I had to return them.
3,7-Aug-18,4,"Smell takes time to get used to The scent takes some getting used to ‚Äî I read the reviews so I knew it wasn‚Äôt lavender, but still didn‚Äôt like it when I initially burned these, but I‚Äôve started to like it a lot more now that the smell has become a bit more faded with use."
3,6-Jan-20,5,Love that it came with 2 for the price! I love that it came with 2 for the price you pay. Great gift for 1 person or 2 people if you split them.
3,1-Jul-19,5,"LAVENDER FIELDS Most beautiful and relaxing scent! I burn this each each night in my bedroom before I go to bed, makes me calm and relax so I can sleep better!"
3,1-Aug-18,5,"No Need To Waste Wax Left At Bottom Hi, this and the Verbena scent are refreshing for the kitchen where cooking and sink odors can lurk.  For those reviewers complaining about unused wax at the bottom after the wick burns out, Just Use A Knife To Scrape The Wax Chunks & Bits Out & Add To A New Candle Little By Little.  I never have to waste this great product."
3,31-Jan-17,1,I really wanted to like these... I really wanted to like these as I LOVE basil and am looking for clean burning soy candles but this does not smell like basil at all. When unuburned it smells like a chemical lemon and while burning it smells like something rubber on fire or an overheating electronic. I had three different people think that something rubber was on fire! :-(
3,1-May-17,3,"Not a Lavendar Smell, but Nice It's a soy candle, which is hands down much better than your standard wax-based candle, but if you're looking for something with a distinct lavendar smell, keep looking.  This is a mix of lavendar and citrus smells.  It might be helpful outside also, but I'm not sure that it would given the lack of lavendar smell."
3,8-Jan-20,4,Smells great! Fairly plain looking jars but boy oh boy do they smell great! Seems to burn well too.
3,4-Feb-20,1,No scent and smoky You get what you pay for.
3,8-Mar-20,5,Will buy again!! Love this smell! Very strong
3,12-Jun-18,5,These candles smell very much like the other Mrs These candles smell very much like the other Mrs. Meyer's products. The burn time is outstanding -- quite long!
3,4-Mar-19,5,Yes I luv it
3,24-Feb-20,5,"Smell Great Wife loves it, great price"
3,10-May-18,5,Five Stars No beautiful to look at...but smells like a very clean house....
3,31-Jan-17,2,Soy candles are wonderful and good for the enviroment Soy candles are wonderful and good for the enviroment.  But the scent doen't smell like Lavender at all.  It smells like a cleaning product. If its lavender youre looking for.  This is not it.
3,11-Jul-18,5,Five Stars Cannot live without this fragrance. Same goes for the hand soap.
3,27-Jan-17,5,relaxing when your T is too high Subtle but pleasant.  I trust Mrs. Meyers.  Hopefully it won't increase my estrogen.
3,14-Aug-17,3,"Fragrant but short lived. Nice fragrance but they burn pretty quickly.  And when it gets closer to the bottom of the jar, it's harder to light the candle - I had to purchase a long lighter for this."
3,11-Oct-17,5,Five Stars Love these. Basil for days. The scent lingers in a nice light way for days.
3,8-Mar-18,5,Five Stars Very pleasant aroma soft yet constant.
3,3-Mar-17,1,"One Star I thought I was getting 2, very deceiving...."
3,7-May-20,4,Excellent candles..... Excellent long burning candles. Scent is wonderful
4,29-Nov-18,5,"The pineapple evergreen one is the best ""Pineapple-Evergreen candle you say?!?"" I said as I read the description of the candle. I had ordered it for a friend but fell madly in love with the smell. You would assume the scents in combination would have a warring feud lasting for centuries as to who would be in control [of the scent in your nose], much like the Montagues and the Capulets.However, these two scents are like Romeo and Juliet. They compliment each other in ways the world would never have thought possible. Pineapple has a rebellious streak and an unstable past. It used to be a party girl getting wasted each weekend but is looking for a stable relationship while it provides the passion. Evergreen has a pretty steady life ‚Äì working an office job and slowly advancing in its career hoping to settle down and have a family with the ""one"". It has been craving some long term commitment and is ready to give it, but never had the passion there in its past relationships. Evergreen got too bored of cedar and other forest scents who would love to commit but never had that spark.Things all changed when their scents met. Pineapple gives that spark to keep your candle burning while Evergreen provides that support to keep the scent going. A passionate combination!Would buy again!"
4,9-Nov-19,1,?üö®?üö®DANGEROUS PRODUCT ?üö®?üö® SAFETY HAZARD ?üö®?üö®?üö®?üö®If you cherish your home and loved ones then please avoid this product. I left the candle on next to my front door and suddenly saw a strong glare against the wall. The flame starting burning frantically and then the candles glass casing completely burst. The dire almost started spreading but fortunately I placed it in a holder and put it out with a fire extinguisher. AVOID THIS PRODUCT!!!
4,25-Jul-18,5,"Very pleased Wanted to find a candle that would last longer than your average glade candle from walmart or a 22$ candle from bath and body, so i googled long lasting candle and this is what i found. This is my first purchase of this candle. I wasnt sure what to expect with the scents so i picked the wild lemongrass. The smell is great! Not too strong but still makes a noticable difference. Ive never had a soy candle before so ive definitely noticed the difference in life. I cant remember a time ive had a candle last this long! This candle is said to burn for 40 hours so out of curiosity ive kept record of times of burning. Its at 33 hours already with about half an inch left, i see it lasting the full 40 hours, maybe even a bit longer. Very happy with this purchase, would buy again."
4,1-Sep-18,4,"Smells good.  Smaller than I expected The fresh linen has a good scent.  Not too over-powering.  Nothing in the description was misleading, but I guess I expected it to be larger.  Including a picture with hand for scale."
4,19-Mar-19,5,"Tiny Candle, Big Fragrance! I'm pleasantly surprised and very pleased with the candle I ordered. When it arrived in the mail, my husband asked me what I had ordered that smelled so good. The fragrance was obvious before I even unpacked it. The pineapple and evergreen combination is wonderful! Even better, it's not irritating to my synthetic fragrance-sensitive nose or to my daughter, who has asthma/allergies. This one is a keeper and I look forward to trying other varieties of their candies.The candle itself, is as described. It's burning slowly and evenly - no burning down in the center of the candle. The fragrance is most concentrated in the room I'm burning it, but it can be subtly smelled on the other end of our house. It was well packaged and arrived in perfect condition."
4,9-Aug-18,5,"Clean and Mellow I got the Fresh Linen candle and it has the best scent! Very clean, and not too strong like some other brands, it burns low and slow and puts off just enough scent to fill a bathroom or small office, but not enough to give you a headache. The scent is exactly what I look for when I am looking for a fresh linen or clean sheets candle. The label is very simple as well, which means it doesn't clash with any decor!"
4,7-Aug-18,5,Fantastic Candle especially for the price. The candle was brilliant.  It smelled great from the start but not overpowering.  I bought the Vanilla Latte and Pineapple Evergreen and they both were terrific scents.  It lasted approximately 50 hours as I kept track out of my own curiosity.  It burned evenly and even the jar was so simple and elegant looking.Great candle and definitely worth the price.
4,18-Aug-18,5,Nice scent and log lasting I bought the wild lemongrass scent. It has a strong lemon scent without being too sweet. I lit the candle in my living room and could smell in the dinning room and kitchen (about 650 sq ft) so it throws a nice scent without being over powering. I have burned it for about 10-12 hours already and it only dropped about a 1/2 inch so i anticipate it will burn for at least 70 hours if not more as they state.
4,22-May-20,5,"Smelled the candle through the box i got the sexy man candle scent and all i can tell you is that the scent is pretty darn sexy. As soon as i lit up the candle my girlfriend came up to me and asked me what the smell was. I said it was me, she looked at me with the gaze of a hungry lioness and i new right then and there this was the sexiest purchase i ever made. i dont really have a girlfriend but if i did this would have happend."
4,28-May-19,1,Glad my house did not burn down! DO NOT BUY THESE CANDLES !!..The container is a cheap plastic with a circle of plastic on the inside of the top that melted leaking hot wax all over the place. Big mess. I blew out the candle and put the top half way on. The plastic is so cheap that it started to melt. Waste of money. WHO MAKES CANDLES IN PLASTIC CONTAINERS ! I have always had glass holders. Be careful people.! This could have caused a fire .
4,13-Aug-18,5,Perfect candle I love this candle! It is highly scented so you can actually smell the scent of the candle when its burning and it fills the room. The packaging of this candle is so simple and stylish as well that it goes with any style of decor. I also really appreciate that it comes with a lid--I have stopped buying candles without a lid because the smoke from blowing out the candle isn't fun just after you've been enjoying the scent of your candle. I would definitely purchase another candle from this company.
4,16-Nov-18,1,do not leave this alone Candle burned down and the glass shattered. Very dangerous
4,12-Jun-19,1,Bait and switch -reviews r purchased with free gift! This had no scent whatsoever. It lasts a long time but what‚Äôs the point. And the only reason it has so many positive reviews is because they offer you a free travel candle if you give a positive review. This should not be allowed. Definitely would not have purchased!
4,1-Jul-19,3,"Manipulated reviews After all the great reviews, I made the purchase.  Like a lot of sellers, they manufacture high reviews by offering free add-ons for a positive reviews:  in my case, it was a Travel Tin Candle.With that in mind, it is an average product.  Has a light lemon/vaseline scent which is nice but nothing special.  Hope this helps and all the best."
4,12-May-19,1,"Terribly dissappointed! Wouldn't know scent if life depended on it. {pineapple/evergreen} One review said it was good and it sounded different. Definitely a waste, I've had 4 people smell it and no one can identify scent or even if there is one. Other scents maybe be OK, but this is the only one I've bought. Not saying they don't make good scented candles but mine was a waste."
4,8-Jul-19,5,"The reviews speak for itself this candle is fantastic! I absolutely love it! It smells fantastic and makes a great aroma for my wood study room/ bedroom, which is why I chose to go with Vanilla Oak! First purchase and it‚Äôs only the beginning these candles are fantastic. I never really liked candles because yeah they‚Äôre nice and all, but they barely smell. I saw this candle with the reviews and decided why not go for a nice flavor and give it a shot! Very impressed honestly it fits my room very well! My room upstairs is 820 sq ft (wood room) and this candle can easily cover the half it‚Äôs near. The rest of the room after roughly 30-40 minutes will have a subtle aroma, which honestly is perfect for me because I want the candle to still smell natural rather than me walking upstairs and just getting blasted in the nostrils with Vanilla Oak instead it‚Äôs very soothing and subtle, yet somehow very noticeable i can‚Äôt really describe it haha, but you won‚Äôt regret buying this candle at all!"
4,1-Jul-19,3,"Best candles ever...ALMOST-UPDATE UPDATE: While I stand by my original review, I am updating to discuss the wick.Ive ordered at least 7 or 8 of these candles in different scents. The one complaint I have is that the wick is not long enough for the entire candle. U loose at least 25 to 30 percent which is alot, bc the wick isnt long enough.  So i end up trying to add a wick to burn the rest, or putting the jar on a candle warmer..not the same effect.ordered several of these so far and love them. My favorite scents are Tobacco spice and Fresh Linen. I liked the pineapple eucalyptus but it's not as strong. These are clean burning, nice scents that throw off heavy without being too strong. No soot or wick crashing or tunneling as I think it's called. One drawback...these are small for the cost. Theres maybe 6 hours of burning in a 6oz candle..which is a bit expensive bc these are $14 candles.  But it's a premium candle and does kill bad odors fast like when the hubby forgets to take out the kitchen trash..or stinks up a bathroom!"
4,30-Nov-19,1,"Very poor product, Look elsewhere. I was very disappointed with this purchase, in fact, I purchased 2 candles, gifted 1 of them, and even the person I gifted it to did not like this candle.  I know the scent of the Tobacco, Spice & Vanilla, that is what I most often purchase, but I was disappointed with the scent of the candle.  I do wear Tobacco Vanille from Tom Ford so I enjoy that specific fragrance.  I believe this company can do better with this fragrance and they should.Also, just a recommendation, for the price that customers are paying, increase the candle size.  I can go purchase better quality candles from retail stores that sell them for significantly less.  I know that Marshalls, Ross, and Target have great candles in the price point of $6 - $10 and they are double and triple the size of this small candle.Don't waste your money, purchase elsewhere.  I know it's not a great review, but decrease your price point significantly to the value of your candle.  Your candle is small, therefore the cost should resemble the value the customer is receiving.Also, spend more capital on your R&D to develop more satisfying scents."
4,24-Nov-19,1,"Your money, Your choice. I don‚Äôt know you guys ... I don‚Äôt like being negative about products. But I was really expecting major scent from this candle because of the price, and also knew that the candle would be small but not toddler size toy small... kinda disappointed there just for amount of money they cost. I bought two because of the amazing reviews and yes, I have also read bad ones, but I leaned in more to the good reviews and was expecting the best of the best. Yes this candle burns super slow. But the scent isn‚Äôt as strong, I could I just smell it, if I bring it close to my nose, I‚Äôm highly disappointed. I got the midnight in Paris candle and also the pineapple evergreen candle... but I mean I wish I could get my money back becayse I spent $30 bucks for two. This is just my honest review. I‚Äôm glad it worked out for other people tho, it just didn‚Äôt for me."
4,12-May-19,5,"Addicting, delicious scent I'm usually leary of buying candles without smelling them, but I took a leap of faith because of the great reviews and I am so happy I did.  I purchased the Pineapple Evergreen scent, again because of the reviews of it and because pineapple with evergreen was difficult to imagine and so, left me curious.  You won;t be disappointed in this scent!  It's a scent that both men and women would find pleasing, as it's not overpowering yet still a full bodied scent.  It's refreshing and a scent that is calming and lifts your spirit whether you've had  a long day in the sun, behind the desk or have taken it easy.  After an hour of burning, both my husband and myself feel rejuvinated and rested.  It's lovely and I double dare you to try it!"
4,13-Jul-19,1,"The cedarwood + mango = headaches. Don't buy No. 29!! The ""No. 29 Cedarwood Infused Mango"" is nauseating to say the least.The first red flag is the fact that this company lists *ALL* of their candle scents under the same listing (basically the same SKU in the retail world). Thats why you see a bunch of reviews talking about completely different candles/scents."
4,31-Jan-20,4,"Pretty candles, BEAUTIFUL fragrances! I‚Äôve purchased 2 candles by Lulu:The 9 oz Jasmine, Oud, & Sandalwood smells lovely! I‚Äôve burned it probably 8 times so far and there is still a good amount left in the candle!  I‚Äôm very good about trimming the wick every time I use it though. Wouldn‚Äôt call it a super duper high fragrance candle, but the black glass is very pretty and the scent is also.The 6 oz. Tobacco spice & Vanilla is also a very attractive candle and the scent is truly beautiful. My only complaint on this one is it‚Äôs such a small candle to have 2 large stickers on it. One safety sticker on the bottom is more than enough in my opinion. The large square sticker on the back will be very visible when I burn the candle, and it‚Äôs not one of those stickers that peels off easily. It‚Äôs really on there! For a 6 oz. $15.00 candle I‚Äôd like it to be attractive. Overall, GREAT candles. I think they are worth the price (especially w/prime shipping) & I‚Äôm a conscious consumer about how I spend my money.UPDATE: lulu candles has an offer available and they sent me a free 2 oz. tin & I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs the tobacco & vanilla, which I love! It‚Äôs probably my favorite ‚ô•Ô?è Thank you lulu! Nice company"
4,27-Feb-19,5,"Pretty strong scent, but smells great (Espresso Bean) I just bought a few more candles from this place because I liked the first batch I got. The Espresso bean was pretty strong, but I liked it...had a few people compliment the scent as they entered my home. I recently got the Tobacco shoppe scent which is really nice...also got the suede, which is definitely on the masculine side, but it works well and smells good. These also burn pretty slow overall, so I'm a fan."
4,19-May-19,4,"A Beautiful Scent that Fills My Large Bedroom! Finally! This was my second purchase of the Lulu candle in Jasmine, Oud, and Sandalwood, 3 scents I just love. The first candle, which I bought a couple years ago, barely had a scent. I was extremely disappointed, as the scent is WHY I buy candles! But I took another chance and reordered another one. Thankfully, this candle DOES have a discernible scent! I gave it four stars instead of 5 because it isn‚Äôt as strong a scent as I would like, but it does have enough fragrance to fill my large bedroom. And I think my sense of smell might not be the greatest, as others seem to be able to smell things that I can‚Äôt. So when I DO buy candles, I always go for highly scented ones.  This scent is heavenly. I think it‚Äôs the OUD that makes it smell so wonderful. So I do recommend Lulu candles for people who love scents in their candles. I just purchased another one by Lulu since I can enjoy this one so much!"
4,9-Jul-20,4,"Quality scent that lasts! Absolutely obsessed with this Jasmine,Oud, and  Sandalwood candle! The scent is just incredible. If I could buy the fragrance as a perfume, I would. This is the second candle I‚Äôve bought from Lulu and I‚Äôm still impressed. Scent is fairly strong and will linger for a while after the candle is burning (which I appreciate.) nothing is quite as refreshing as when it smells good walking in the front door. Scent is not overpowering and does not cause a headache if you leave the candle burning too long.The candle itself burns clean (no popping or smoking. Packaging is clean and simple and does not detract from a room. I‚Äôm all for buying made in America products when I can and really appreciate the brand. This is the perfect made in America candle."
4,19-May-19,5,"So good that I bought another! I didn't know what to expect from a soy candle, but the scent sounded interesting, so I ordered one.  I'm so glad that I did.The scent is strong.  I'm not saying that it's overpowering, it's strong in a good way.  It really fills the room.  Compared to regular wax candles, this one seems to last longer.  Still, I used the first one so much that I had to buy another.  I'm sure there'll be more in the future."
4,30-Oct-19,4,"Pineapple Evergreen Candle Because of another user's rave review, I decided to get the Pineapple Evergreen scent (although I was very curious about the Sexy Man scent...). When it arrived I was so excited. It smelled DELIGHTFUl. I have been disappointed in lots of candles so I was on the hunt to find one that was perfect (long-lasting, scent that fills the whole room). I was a little disappointed with it because it didn't fill up the whole room with the scent as well as I had hoped it would. But I would still buy from them again. I just might go back to get the Sexy Man candle because the curiosity is killing me. So overall, I love the scent, I just wish it was a bit more potent. And I would buy from them again."
4,7-Dec-18,5,"great fragrance So I'm a candle junkie... I'm always a little weary about purchasing when I can't pick it up and smell it, but I said I can always return it so I pulled the trigger and ordered No 17 Black Amber by LuLu, I was pleasantly surprised, the fragrance is great, not over powering but enough to let you know you have a candle going.. Im going to be purchasing more, probably right after writing this review...."
4,17-Oct-18,5,"Perfect Scent Strength The scent strength of this candle is fresh and perfect - enough to notice easily without being overwhelming.  You can tell while it‚Äôs burning that the ingredients are natural and healthy to breathe.  I use the Lemongrass at work.  When people walk by my office they take a deep breath and comment on how nice my office smells.  My quest for the perfect, non synthetic candle makes it‚Äôs final stop at LuLus?üíõ"
4,21-Oct-18,5,"Great value, people ask where I got them! Great candles! They‚Äôre cheaper than most candles of the same quality but still burn clean and have a long burn time. Plus, they have a simple design, so they‚Äôre more visually appealing than most other candles I‚Äôve bought through Amazon. I‚Äôve bought the fresh linen scent several times, which are great, but I really like the sugared pecan (since it‚Äôs more seasonal). Highly recommend."
4,30-Mar-20,1,"Buyer beware if for gifting! I like to keep gifts on hand to occasionally surprise my husband with so I bought this December 2019 and I've had it in my closet sealed in its original Amazon box until yesterday (03/29/20), well I gave it to him and watched him unseal the Amazon packaging, then he removed the candle company cardboard box the candle was inside of, then he removes the candle from the box, then he removed the lid from the candle and lo and behold there was a long dark brown hair draped across the inside of the candle jar...nasty.No one in our family has brown hair so I know that unless one of our very young children managed to somehow turn into a genius super villain and figure out how to take a piece of hair then dye it dark brown then unseal 2 cardboard boxes to place the hair inside of the candle jar which I truly don't they are capable of at their young age then all I can figure is that it must have been poor quality control from the candle production company."
4,6-Apr-19,5,"Long Lasting Fragrance I bought the 6oz Cedarwood/Mango scent and I love the subtle interplay of the the two aromas. My husband, who has a poor sense of smell, noticed this one and commented on how much he enjoyed it because he could actually smell it. I, myself, have a normal sense of smell, and for me, the candle gives off a very strong scent, unlike other scented candles I have purchased. As other reviewers have said, the fragrance permeates the air in the room for a good hour after it‚Äôs blown out.It is a pricey candle, but I bought another one to try anyway: jasmine/out/sandalwood."
4,12-Sep-18,5,Yummy smell! I knew the minute I opened the box Id love this scent. A lovely small just wafted out of the box before I even had a chance to light it. A+++I got the pineapple evergreen one!
4,4-Jun-20,5,Best candle ever. These are the best candles. Hands down.I was looking for something new. Came across this brand and read reviews. Pineapple Evergreen?! That sounds ridiculous. I have to smell it!10 minutes after buying it I decided it is my most favorite candle ever. Burned it non stop.Went to order more - people must have heard about it because they were out of stock. So I tried a vanilla. YES!!!Put in an order for 4 more Pineapple while they were out of stock and they showed up weeks earlier than expected. It was like Christmas.  You have a lifelong customer.
4,23-Jun-20,4,"Petite Candle With Medium Throw I purchased the 6 oz candle in the Pineapple Evergreen scent after reading positive reviews on this particular scent. The candle is definitely on the petite size measuring just under 4 inches tall and about 3 1/2 inches across. That being said, after burning the candle for about 5.5 hours the day it arrived and another couple of hours just last night, I do expect the candle to have plenty of burn time as very little of the wax has disappeared (assuming the wick holds out). Speaking of the wick, I was a little concerned that as it is a bit off center the candle might not burn well, but so far it hasn‚Äôt presented any issue. The scent is pleasant and not overpowering, although my nose picks up mostly on pineapple and not much evergreen but your experience may be different. I would call the throw ‚Äúmedium‚Äù as I could easily smell the candle in the large open room I was burning it in, but not throughout the rest of the house. Overall I am pleased with my purchase and plan on giving some of the other scents a try."
4,30-Apr-19,5,"Amazing fragrance!!! Last scent I would think to order would be pineapple / evergreen.  The beautiful candle arrived today -- lit it up in the bathroom upstairs and the scent is delicately wafting throughout the house.  I can't recommend this candle more highly but wish I could give it 11 stars.  I can't recommend longevity since it is new but I'll go with other recommenders who said their's lasted 40 hours.UPDATE:  I just received #s 4 and 5 of Lulu candles.  4 of them are the evergreen pineapple because they are so brilliant and provide a light scent throughout the house -- two floors.  We used Linen which is nice but evergreen pineapple is hands down our favorite.  Candle lasts a very long time as I already wrote.  Worth every penny.  Can't rave about the candle, scent, and service enough.UPDATE AGAIN:  Received our new order of two evergreen pineapple.  I can't rave about these candles enough.  No smoke, long lasting, and beautiful, delicate scent throughout the 2 story house."
4,2-Jan-19,5,"Great Smelling and Long Lasting Soy Candle - Wild Lemongrass My wife noticed that all of our previous candles were putting so much soot into the air, so she wanted some soy candles that would not have the black, nasty soot we had been breathing. She bought these and I have one in my office, and it smells so nice, like a spa. And even after you blow it out, it's scent continues to permeate the air for another hour or so. We have bought 4 so far, and are trying other scents from this company!"
4,15-Apr-20,1,"No. 17 Black Amber I am only reviewing the product i specifically bought and have experienced. I bought the No. 17 Back Amber Soy candle 6oz.Made in the USA: During these trying times, i feel it is imperative we support the local markets.Scent: No scentLongevity: Average, i bought this candle thinking the cost may be warranted based on performance, but sadly it is not. You can buy similar performing candles  at half the cost.Burn: Part of the candle experience is the flame and the even melting of the candle wax. The flame is really small (Maybe this is how it last longer) and 1/4 to a half inch of the wax surrounding the flame is left unutilized (Waste).Packaging: Thought it was glass but it appears to be a hard clear plastic container with lid. Labeling consistent with trendinessOverall i would not recommend this candle for the above reasons. Maybe it was a ""bad"" candle, but i'm not willing to spend the 15 dollar again to find out."
4,29-Aug-20,5,"Lives up to the hype! Love it! I purchased the small (8 oz.) one to try, since I was skeptical about the scent, but very curious after reading reviews. I have a fine sense of smell, so chemicals, cleaners, even candles with artificial scents give me a headache or make me feel nauseous. I do love candles however, and am constantly searching for a way to keep things fresh in certain rooms of the house. Nice packaging and looks well made. This candle came out of the box with a strong yet not overpowering and very pleasant fragrance. I still wonder about the first person who thought of putting pineapple with evergreen, but it is very pleasing to the nose!"
4,31-Oct-20,5,"Superior quality! (Seriously better than dyptique!) I can honestly say these are probably the best candles I have ever purchased. I am a big lover of beautiful, fresh scents in my home. For many years I found most candles to be pointless, however, as the scent never spread (I could only really smell them when the candle wasn‚Äôt lit and I put my nose to the wax). A while ago I decided to try dyptique given the brand‚Äôs popularity and, while the scents delivered in both quality and how far the scents carried, at about $80 for a small sized candle the price was very steep. I bought 3 nonetheless because they were the only ones that really did what I expected. Fast forward to a few weeks ago when I stumbled upo Lulu candles and, given the reviews and price (a mere fraction of the dyptique candles) I decided to give it a try. First I purchased the jasmine infused bergamot. I was absolutely blown away! The 9oz is quite sizeable, the smell is heavenly, and the scent permeated throughout my entire living room and beyond. What‚Äôs more is the candle is so long lasting, burns nicely and doesn‚Äôt leave they uneven wax buildup on the edges (which is a pet peeve of mine and affects the candle over time as the wax drips down from the sides and causes the flame to weaken). I never thought I would get so excited over a candle but it truly is superior quality. I even bought this jasmine and green tea and I think it smells even better, as if that were possible. Kudos to this business for such an amazing product and I know I will be a customer for years!"
4,21-Oct-20,5,"It's like sitting in my favorite coffee shop, pre-pandemic I've been working from home since March. I've been making my own coffee at home since March. I decided I wanted to try and become a ""candle person"" but I'm so sensitive to scents in general. Most candles smell too ""artificial"" to me, or too strong, and I end up getting a headache right away. Enter the ""Espresso Bean"" candle by Lulu. With the soft espresso scent, when I close my eyes (and ignore the screaming children currently fighting over who gets to play with Mom's phone) I'm immediately transported to my favorite coffee shop, in precedented times, when we could sit in a coffee shop relaxing with a coffee made by someone else and maybe even chatting with a friend. Ah, simpler times. So, if you have been stuck at home since March and wish you were working outside of the house, get this candle. The Lulu candles also make great gifts, even the 6oz is very substantial, comes in a classy glass jar with a metal lid with silicone gasket (so it's quiet and secure)"
4,6-Dec-18,5,A seductive scent. Recommended! This is a lovely and enveloping scented candle that has a good throw without being overbearing. I love that the candle is made from soy wax without any chemicals involved. And the packaging makes it easy for gifting.  I will be buying more in the future as I am quite pleased from this Lulu Candle.
4,27-Feb-20,4,"An honest review This was my third purchase from the vendor. This is a beautiful and sleek candle that is perfectly giftable. Smell is long lasting and burn time forgiving. However, I do not know what on earth the hype is on this particular scent (Jasmine, Oud, and Sandal Wood). I for one like muskier smells (a big fan of men‚Äôs cologne) and I was deeply bewildered by this particular scent. It was not long until I realized it smells just like my late grandmother‚Äôs home and her daughter‚Äôs home. One may call it a sophisticated aroma but I would it‚Äôs very ‚Äúold lady‚Äù and borderline burlesque. MIND YOU: the more I smell it the more I can begin to tolerate its mature, powdery make up, and I‚Äôm determined to finish the candle to the very end. However, by all means will I only restock on Pineapple Evergreen so my home smells fresh and upbeat than the intense notes this candle delivers."
4,18-Sep-20,5,"Pleasantly Surprised! Great Pineapple Evergreen Scent + Excellent Value! I have to say, I was a bit skeptical about the Pineapple Evergreen scent at first - I couldn't really imagine these scents working all that well together... but fortunately it's an amazing combination! Initially, this candle leans more pineapple (especially right when you open it), but as the candle burns, the throw leans heavier on the evergreen, which I love. (I tend to prefer clean, crisp, fresh, and woodsy scents over fruity scents, so I was thrilled with the evergreen notes).I'm also impressed with the burn time - I got the smaller size, since I wasn't sure if I would like it, and it has lasted a surprisingly long time! Overall, very happy with the looks, scent, and value of this candle, and will likely re-order the larger size. Definitely recommend!"
4,29-May-20,4,"Great candle but not the scent I was looking for I‚Äôm a very discerning candle junkie. I love high end dyptique candles and I bought this after reading sooo many reviews on its similarity to le labos Santal scent.  It‚Äôs a great candle but if you‚Äôre looking for a similar scent to the high end ones I don‚Äôt think it smells anything like them.  I also ordered the pineapple evergreen and I loved that one. Will def reorder that scent. For the price these are great candles, they just didn‚Äôt meet what I was looking for in scent similarity."
4,23-Jan-19,5,"FINALLY!  I FOUND IT This candle is AMAZING!  I have searched high and low over the years for the most appealing, fragrant candle.  This is it.  I've ordered two more just this week with many, many more to follow.  I wish the price point was lower; however, I am willing to pay a premium for the fragrance.  It fills up a whole wing of my home.  I will definitely buy many more and will check out other scents in the line as well.  Bravo!"
4,11-Dec-18,2,"The Worst!!!!!! When this candle arrived I couldn't believe how tiny it is. VERY TINY. Also, it's not very fragrant, I got the lemongrass based on other reviews. Only has a faint smell. Skip it. I do not recommend."
4,1-Nov-20,5,"Pineapple Evergreen ?üçç?üå? I spent an hour researching ‚Äústrong scented candles‚Äù and their reviews. I never purchased a candle that I wasn‚Äôt able to smell first either. So Lulu Pineapple Evergreen was purchased after I read all the great reviews on it!And I am not disappointed!It definitely smells like pineapple ?üçç ... and there‚Äôs a supple hint of evergreen ?üå? ..  I really like the weird combination of this & it‚Äôs a very fresh scent. It‚Äôs as strong as a yankee candle, if not stronger. I‚Äôve had it lit for 2 hours already, and barely any wax is used up!So I had to order another one, but I‚Äôm going to try a different scent.I got my order the next day. They even give you a coupon code for a free travel can. So I‚Äôm very impressed with that! I‚Äôll continue to buy and try these odd scent combos!"
4,6-Feb-19,5,"Smells real nice Soon after lighting the candle, some delivery guys came to my house and the first thing the guy said upon entering was that it smelled real good in the house. This is the Jasmine, Oud, and Sandal Wood version. In fact, he said it twice. The smell permeated the whole house, and even smelled nice unlit.  The candle burn-time didn‚Äôt last as long as I would have liked, especially for the price, but I will be ordering this again."
4,26-Jun-20,2,"Bummer in the Summer My sister in law had this on her Amazon list so I didn‚Äôt pay much attention to the details. It‚Äôs pretty small for $15. It‚Äôs a little bigger than a votive candle and in a nicer jar. It smells fabulous and I know this because when it arrived, my whole house smelled like a man! This is because it melted all over the box due to the lousy packaging and shipping even though the people packaging the parcel knew it was shipping to Las Vegas in June!!! I guess I should have thought about that, but other candles have arrived fine."
4,19-Aug-20,5,"Long-lasting candles and well worth the price I am very picky about candles, and have always shopped for them in person so I could smell them. The pandemic made that difficult, so I turned to Amazon. I read lots of reviews, and these sounded promising. I ordered the 6 oz because I figured if I didn't like the smell, it isn't a big commitment. Although it's a small candle, the cotton wick means it burns much more slowly and the flame burns ""low"" to the wax so it releases more fragrance than candles with a tall flame. I've burned this candle for 12 hours a day for a week, and it's not even a third of the way gone. So even though this candle is more expensive than what I might pay for a normal candle in a discount store, it is much cheaper in the long run when you calculate burning time. The scents are also amazing! I bought the crumb cake (vanilla/cinnamon notes), pineapple evergreen (sweet and tropical tempered by subtle undertones of pine), and tobacco vanilla spice (reminds me of the smell of pipesmoke). All of them are even better than I expected, and permeate my whole house. So happy with these candles!"
4,13-Mar-20,3,"Hmmm? I purchased two of these candles, so I have averged the rating. One of the candles was a definite ""5"".  The scent was wonderful, it lasted a reasonable amount of time, and it burned evenly and cleanly.  I'm not sure what was wrong with the second one., but I'm rating it a  ""1"".  The scent started out ok, but once the candle was approximately half burned it began to send up black smoke, and it smelled awful.  I immediately blew it out and did not relight it.  I don't know what would cause such a major difference with two candles bought at the same time, but I don't think that I will purchase these again.  I  also purchased another size and same scent of this same brand, so I hope that it will work out better.  I really loved the first candle!"
4,21-Nov-20,5,"The Unicorn of Scent: nice smelling, not too strong and doesn't hang in the air for days Yes, I really appreciate how long this little candle burns and yes, it is packaged nicely so it looks nice too. But there are plenty of other soy, craft candles out there who hit these marks. This is the ONLY candle I've found that doesn't try to commandeer your sense of smell and leave a lingering odor (that doesn't smell the same as the candle burning).While burning, this unicorn of a candle provides a lovely scent without overpowering. It compliments rather than covers up. When the candle isn't burning, you don't smell it. It's perfect for bedside reading or on your desk while endlessly Zooming.Thank you Lulu Candle for getting this right. I'm a customer for life!"
4,17-Jan-19,5,"Amazing I just got this, and have yet to test out its overall durability, but it smells absolutely wonderful and I can already tell this is going to be a better candle than the ones that I have because of it being soy. I can breathe happier with this candle than my ones from bath and body works. Definitely recommend! It is a little on the pricey side for a relatively tiny container, but it is overall worth it."
4,28-Nov-19,1,"Does not smell good Initially, I thought this soy candle smelled good, but them it seemed to have a chemical smell.  Did not even light it - as I don't like the smell.  On the label it says ""this candle generates $3 donation..."" towards a group of their choice.  I would rather have $3 knocked off of the price - which is very high for a 6 oz candle!  I choose to donate to groups of my choice.  I don't like being 'forced' to donate if I want to purchase the item.  Giftable?  Yes, I suppose so, but 6 oz is very small. I returned it."
4,4-May-20,5,"THE best candle Okay. I have a few points that I'll make short and sweet.Pineapple and evergreen are a great pair, and it's a match made in heaven. I took a gamble but took the plunge and I have zero regrets.I've had this candle burning for over 12 hours, and it's hardly been used up. Maybe about 1/8th of the total candle. I usually use B&BW, and I always felt that I have to ration the candle to enjoy it longer. NOT with this candle. Soy has changed my candle life.The packaging is cute, and simple. Very minimalist, which I LOVE.Shipping packaging was perfect, there was no damage, and it was carefully packed in paper.If you want a great smelling candle that will burn for a long time (seriously, this is gonna last you), then you should get this candle."
4,21-Jun-20,5,Very happy and I‚Äôm picky! Smells great! We could smell it even when it was still boxed. I do not like overwhelming smells and get headaches but this doesn‚Äôt do that ironically. My husband said he wanted to eat it because it smells so good-lolEspresso bean is what we bought. Not too sweet or strong but very fragrant. Great container too.
4,20-Jan-19,5,"FAVORITE candles The candle is on the smaller side but these are still my favorite candles! I‚Äôve ordered many of the scents: sugar pecan, fresh linen, pinapple evergreen & blueberry cobbler (this one being my all time favorite. i‚Äôve ordered the blueberry at least 4 times now & even bought it as a gift for two people who also loved the scent .5/20/20: Tried the lemon & vanilla. This brand of candles never fails me. Every scent is amazing & the candles last a while."
4,15-Oct-19,5,"Why pay more for any other candle?? I am in LOVE with LuLu candles. I used to spend 3x the money on Dyptique candles before finding LuLu candles on Amazon. They have similar scents and the candles look just as classy / cool on display.My ""Go-To"" scents are Tobacco, Spice &Vanilla; Jasmine, Oud & Sandalwood, Amber; Rose & Sheer Musk and Pineapple Evergreen (depending on weather) I always make sure I have extra stored away because I never want to use any other candle again."
4,3-Jan-19,3,small for price Candle smells nice but I was looking for a bigger candle at a better value.
4,22-Jun-20,5,"Finally, a coffee scented candle I've been on the hunt like Goldilocks. Either the candles do not actually smell like coffee, or it's some sort of sweet vanilla or caramel scent. This is exactly like opening a bag of freshly roasted beans, but it's close enough for me to buy it again."
4,14-Sep-19,5,"Pineapple Evergreen is Surprisingly Complimentary I read the reviews and couldn't really believe it.  But now that I've tried it, indeed the Pineapple Evergreen is something unique and nice.  It's currently late summer / early fall, so this isn't quite the perfect scent for the season, but I can imagine this being perfect for winter.  It's that hit of Christmas evergreen with a woody and piney heart, but just enough tropical sunny pineapple to provide the fruity top notes.  Certainly worth trying."
4,12-Feb-20,4,"Really packs a punch! I like to light a candle as soon as I get home from work at about 6 pm until the second I start falling asleep at around midnight (it‚Äôs a problem) and I was in the market for a longer-lasting candle that wouldn‚Äôt disappear in a week so I bought a 6 oz size to test it. I found my candle! I don‚Äôt know what magic is in these things, but I‚Äôve been using this candle for about a week now and it‚Äôs barely even dented the top of it! Seriously. The pineapple evergreen is definitely more pineapple than evergreen, so I‚Äôll probably choose something a little fresher/less sweet smelling next time (personal preference), but I‚Äôm so pleased with the quality!EDIT: Changed my review from 5 stars to 4. I just bought wild lemongrass, thinking it'd be more fresh, as before I mentioned the scent was a little too sweet for me. The smell is SO sweet and strong, it makes me nauseous. If you're not sensitive to sweet smells, this candle will absolutely last SUPER long and is worth the money, but at this point I'll have to throw the candle away because I can't even bring myself to test it out again. So kind of a waste of money for me."
4,10-Apr-19,3,"No real smell This candle does not really give off a smell. If you get really close to it and sniff candle, you can smell a great scent. However, it is not like most candles that give a wonderful smell while it is lit or after. It is organic and chemical free or so they say. Yet, I would not spend the money on it, since it is expensive and has no smell. Not really sure how all the other people are smelling a scent from the candle."
4,30-Aug-20,2,"Meh, boring weak scented candle. Honestly this candle is not great at all. It smells strongly of plain wax (I know how ridiculous that‚Äôs sounds since it‚Äôs a wax candle lol) but hear me out -  every time I order something from a company and it includes a card that says they will send you a free gift if you write a review it makes sense how such a mediocre product has such a high rating. This is just a basic boring candle with a very weak scent. Hard pass, will not be ordering again. I‚Äôd rather splurge on my more pricy candles that actually smell good. For reference I ordered the black amber and it smells way too sweet to be ‚Äúblack amber‚Äù"
4,3-Nov-19,5,"Excellent overally, but I wish they were more affordable! These are pretty good candles!  They last longer than you'd expect by their size, and the scents are of good quality.  This particular fragrance (Sexy Man) had too much of a vanilla-like hint to it for my taste.  I *HATE* vanilla, but I actually liked the candle overall.  So the hint is subtle.  I have also had the Wild Lemongrass scent and vastly prefer it!While these seem to be reasonable priced in comparison to other scented candles, it can be a bit expensive to burn these things regularly.  I have found myself wanting to use them very sparingly so as to extend their value.  I will keep buying them, but I wish they were more affordable for regular use.  I think the 6 oz. lasted me less than a month, and that was with burning it for about two hours a day as a rough estimate."
4,5-Apr-19,3,"Bought Sexy Man Scent Mostly As Joke Gift, Smells Good But Is Much Smaller Than Expected Picture is a regular sized shot glass for size reference. Wanted to get the ‚ÄúSexy Man‚Äù scent for part of a friends bday gift, did not expect it to be SO small for $15 but it does smell quite nice. Just very disappointed in the size. For $15 I expect a decent sized candle, and you could certainly find a great nice big one (that is still a soy candle) at TJ maxx for that. This is puny. It says slow burning but it doesn‚Äôt give you an approximated burn time. My bet is it really doesn‚Äôt last long. No one wants a candle that only lasts a few uses :/"
4,8-Aug-20,3,"soapy (linen) and sharp (pineapple) on first scent, not thrilled, may grow on me.  The linen candle struck me as soap.y; pineapple candle was sharp and assailing. Was looking for a clean, strong, and lovely scent - may be too much to ask?I have PaddyWax No 11 Ralph Waldo Emerson.  Love RWE's  poetryfrom the Boston Hymn:God said, I am tired of kings,I suffer them no more;Up to my ear the morning bringsThe outrage of the poor.The candle scent is not up to his legendary poetry but it is a lovely, clean and strong scent.(I loved Kith's vapor candle by Malin/Goetz perfect for a bathroom or just for a strong clean scent - they are now sold out and waaayyy overpriced!) I also have Yankee Candles (not strong but pleasant) and other brands that are NOT strong despite their reviews"
4,14-Apr-20,5,"Candle from the heavens This candle is it. The candle is what you need in your house, whether it be your room, your laundry room, your bathroom, or your basement. All my friends know that I am crazy for candles. They call me Candle Dan, the candle man. This Fresh Linen scented candle is everything I thought I need and more. I've been sleeping so good and just been so happy since I got this in the mail. And it couldn't have come at a better time. Through the trials and tribulations that have ensued due to the COVID pandemic, THIS CANDLE has been the light that I needed."
4,25-Mar-20,4,"Jasmine & Bergamot - not my ‚òïÔ?è I had this scent as a body wash from L‚ÄôOccitane and was obsessed!  Unfortunately- I believe the scent is only available intermittently... so I was glad to see the same combo in this candle.I have it lit now, the smell is actually.. so-so.I‚Äôm glad it doesn‚Äôt really smell like cheap generic deodorizing sprays.  It has a distinct undertone of citrus to it (bergamot) but it‚Äôs different than the body wash version I had of this scent.I‚Äôm actually very picky as I‚Äôm one of those people that get headaches easily if they are too overpowering.This one is kind of borderline with me, which might be a good thing that I may not have to light it so often as the scent is strong enough (and a big plus since the candle is on the smaller side based on price!)I wanted a more ‚Äúfresh from the garden‚Äù scent - and as this one is not too bad and the quality seems decent, I actually will not consider getting this same scent again."
4,21-Nov-20,5,"Pleasant candles I got Spa and Pineapple Evergreen scents and both smell great. The Spa is a little more subtle and lightly perfumed. The Pineapple Evergreen is stronger and goes beyond the room. The pineapple evergreen is really unique and pleasant. It‚Äôs not something I would normally select but I‚Äôm glad I gave it a try. Both candles have good burn times, I usually burn for 2-3 hours a time and no issues, still have a lot remaining. Definitely would consider these as gifts too."
4,13-Jul-20,5,"wow wow wow sexy man candle i bought this thinking its just another candle....they delivered it and it was sitting in the front of my building for 2 days, i heard all the other residents in my building saying it smells so good in the mail room! come to find out it was this candle! the smell was coming of out the box and package!!! i am def in love with it so far i havent turned it on bc i am saving it for when i have special guest but i already know it is going to smell amazingThe only down fall is that it did NOT come with a lid"
4,8-Aug-20,1,"SMELLS LIKE SOAP Unfortunately, I did not take heed of my nose when these candles first arrived.  I thought they smelled exactly like SOAP......but, when you buy a candle, you usually light them.  And, I did and the scent was the same as my first bewildered whiff.I am writing this to other buyers so that they will know that if they are repelled BY THE FIRST SNIFF of a candle......ask for a return.  Because, if you light the candle, it is yours.Also, if it was sold on Amazon Marketplace, you might have to pay for the return.After buying TONS of candles from Amazon and loving every one of them, This is a dubious name, Fresh Linen, fora candle that smells only like SOAP.  AND, I might add, they were rather expensive to smell so bad."
4,29-Sep-20,5,"Very powerful scent for such a small candle I decided to purchase this candle due to the unique scent combination, and honestly didn't realize how small the candle was until I received it. Given that it isn't too cheap, I was immediately a little skeptical about the value. However, I am happy to say now that I have fully used the candle, I have no complaints!The scent is powerful and the candle is long lasting. It's high quality which makes up for the size. While this scent combination was fun to try, it's not in my typical realm for scents. With that being said, I enjoyed using it, and would love to try other scents from this Company now that I know how high quality it is.I recommend for candle lovers who enjoy vanilla or tobacco scent!"
4,5-Oct-19,1,Waste of time and money For the price of this candle it burned for about 10 minutes. And now it keeps going out . There isn‚Äôt any smell because the candle doesn‚Äôt light !!!!!!!! Don‚Äôt buyThey also send a little card that says write a review and they will send you a free tin candle he‚Äôll no not worth it buy your self a doller store candle much cheaper and you will enjoy it
4,26-May-19,5,"Honestly surprised I have some experience with candles, and all the better-known brands. I was not expecting to say 'wow', but I did. The scent is fresh-smelling, not artificial, and it fills up a room. I can even smell it walking up to the door of my apartment, which is lovely.It is a rather small candle, but I've been surprised by how little it has gone down even after about 12ish hours of use. Other candles 3x the size somehow don't work nearly as well and certainly don't last as long as this one.I'm a little sad I didn't buy these earlier. I didn't really trust candles that I couldn't smell in person, but took the chance anyway. Glad I did. Will purchase a few other scents to try"
4,4-Jan-20,5,"Holy wow Buying a candle without sniffing it in person first was a risk, but it totally worked out for me this time. The Amber, Rose, and Sheer Musk II is a rich scent without being too heavy, and it has surprisingly great staying power. I burned it for about four hours last night (two hours in the living room, two in the bedroom) then lidded the candle and put it away--and now, 24 hours later, the whole apartment still smells amazing. I hadn't expected the scent to be so long-lasting.My only complaint is a super minor one: even after burning for several hours, the wax around the edge of the jar still hadn't melted, so I wrapped an ugly little ring of tin foil around the top half of the jar to encourage it to melt fully. I love the jar's appearance, and hope that I don't have to resort to the tin foil trick every time I light the candle. (Even if I do, though, the scent will be worth the temporary eyesore.)Can't wait to try a few of their other scents, too."
4,9-May-20,4,"Very good but flawed. This was a good product.  I enjoyed the scent--I found it homey and not too sweet.  A self-proclaimed candle hater that claims they ""all make the house smell like a cathedral"" even came into my office to see what smelled so good.  This candle is small but mighty and the scent easily fills up multiple rooms, even with the window open.  The one main flaw that I found was that due to the placement of the wick and the relative size of the jar a lot of wax was left on the side.  I felt that this was wasteful especially since it was $15 for the 6oz candle.  Pictures attached."
4,13-Aug-19,3,"Smells good but weak, does not last very long for the price The candle smelled good, but not very potent. You basically have to put your nose right up to the wax to really appreciate the smell, and it does not fill the room when burning either. Lasted somewhere between 45-55 hours, which is not bad considering its size, but less than what was expected and I don't really think it's worth the price. The candle itself looks nice and the flame burns bright and creates a nice atmosphere. The wax burned evenly without messing with it and left none to waste.PROS:-Smells good-Container looks good and flame creates a nice ambience-Wax burns evenlyCONS:-Smell is very weak, underpowering-Burn time is less than expected (around 50 hours)-Not worth the cost"
4,16-May-19,5,New found love Love love love the fragrance and the candle....i like that it really is long lasting...the fragrance has this subtle undertone and this is probably in my head but it is pretty calmingWhat I really love is that when you blow out the candle it doesn't leave that burnt smell or that black smoke ruining the fragranceThis feature alone has won me over...considering this would be a fixed cost for me what I would really like is some price adjustmentsWhat I would really really hope is for t
4,28-May-20,5,"The perfect fragrance for any place Buy, Buy, Buy....... It's the perfect addition to any place in your home. From the minute you open it from the box, the fragrance just keeps lingering. From the minute you light this beautiful candle the whole ambiance of the place changes, it makes everything seem so beautiful. It's perfect for any nook and corner or the dinning table or the coffee table or even your patio or garden. The fragrance is just PERFECT!It will make a beautiful gift for any occasion. I would have given it more than 5 stars cause this definitely deserves more. Can't wait to buy more of this. Its worth every penny, in fact its not that expensive for what you get in return. So if you are thinking of buying this, don't think much...... just BUY IT!!"
4,27-Aug-20,5,"LONG-LASTING SCENT!!! I received a LULU candle as a gift several months ago. It was THE best gift ever!! I love it! It is called NO. 14 Jasmine, Oud and Sandalwood and OMG,,,,it is such a lovely fragrant. Yummm.....it just keeps burning and burning. You really get your money's worth. So, I decided to order one for myself. I chose the Tobacco and Vanilla. I love the earthy scent of the tobacco with just the slight sweet scent of the Vanilla to balance it out.I will continue to keep buying LULU candles - they are of exceptional value, and are well-packaged when shipped."
4,19-May-20,5,But for your lady love Got this for my lady so she could ‚Äúsmell me‚Äù when I am away for work. She said she looooves to lite it when she lays down to ...... when I am away and says she instantly starts to think of me. Says it reminds her of me getting ready for a red carpet event I had to attend when we were first dating and I spritzed the back of my neck with a men‚Äôs parfum. She said the smell of sitting next to me in the ‚Äútiny Porsche‚Äú on the way to said event comes back to her and the butterflies she was feeling. I wondered why we always have the most amazing nights when I use that parfum.... so needless to say I lite the candle randomly myself while we are home and wait for her to start getting flush and that grin of hers to happen!
4,5-Oct-20,5,"Smells great, lasts long. My fiance loves coffee and purchased this candle, so I was skeptical (I used to work at coffee shops and I hate the smell of stale coffee now), but this candle smells delicious! It smells a lot like the vanilla latte powder that you can get at those gas station auto latte dispensers. This candle also lasts a long time! We've burned it probably 15 hours now, and we only went through 1/3 of the candle. Definitely good quality."
4,19-Dec-19,5,"High quality and smells wonderful This was the first Lulu brand candle I ordered and I'm very pleased with it.It comes in a very attractive jar that looks good in the room and most importantly it smells heavenly! I think the Tobacco Spice and Vanilla is my favorite of all. Its a nice, warm, pleasant scent. Sweet without being too cloying. I liked it so well I ordered another right off the bat and I'm sure this will be a regular at my house.Its made from quality wax and burns nicely too"
4,3-Jun-20,5,"Great Gift, Doggy Aproved! I found this product by searching for ""lavender gifts"" on Amazon. My best friend's birthday is coming up and she absolutely loves lavender, dogs, and candles, so I simply couldn't pass this up! The smell is perfectly fragrant, not too strong, but just enough to make the room smell a little bit like more like a garden. I also loved that a portion of the proceeds from this purchase benefit Furr a Cause, Lulu Candles' initiative to help rescuing abandoned dogs. The candle is the perfect size to place in a bathroom, bedside table, or anywhere else that could use a little flower power. As you can see in the photo, my rescued dog Polo approves! Highly recommend, will be buying from this brand again. Thank you Lulu!"
4,25-Mar-20,4,"Tobacco, Spice & Vanilla smells fantastic, but doesn't quite fill a room with scent This is probably the best scent I have ever gotten in a candle. That being said, it isn't as strong as I was hoping. I left it burning on the corner of my desk for 30-45 minutes and couldn't smell it while sitting at my desk. Regardless, it's a great scent. I'm hoping that if I burn it longer, the scent might get stronger. Would purchase again.UPDATE: At the time of writing this review, I had been in my room for the entirety of the candle burning. After I blew it out and left the room, I came back several hours later and noticed that the Tobacco, Spice, and Vanilla scent was still there! Strange that I couldn't smell it while burning but the smell definitely lingered afterwards. Not sure if I prefer this since I couldn't smell it while burning, but nonetheless I am happy to report that the scent does linger even though its not too strong."
4,6-Oct-20,4,"Wonderfully scented candles in small, clear reusable jars with lids We ordered No. 4 (Lemon-Vanilla Bean), No. 5 (Fresh Linen), and No. 6 (Wild Lemongrass). All three scents are mild, not overpowering and very nice (our favorite is the Wild Lemongrass). We've not yet used them, but look forward to doing so up to 4 hours at a time per the instructions on the back. These arrived in excellent condition and look nice on display. We've since become buyers of 100% beeswax candles, because of possible chemicals involved with processing soy candles. We've also learned to verify the term ""100% soy"" as soy candles without that criteria could contain a host of bad stuff we'd prefer not to burn indoors given health concerns for humans and pets."
4,7-May-19,5,"Great long lasting candles I have tried out a few of these candles now. My favorite scents so far are the Pineapple Evergreen and the Lemon Vanilla Bean. They both have a really pleasant smell and I've gotten compliments from friends visiting my place.The candles last a long time which surprised me considering their size. I have noticed that the candles start off with a strong scent, but as they burn down it is not quite as potent. Also, the scent does not spread super far from the candle; one candle is good to make a small room smell nice, but you would need multiple candles for a large room. Not a super big deal since the candles smell pretty nice in the areas they do affect.My only other critique is that the 6oz candles come with a cover while the 9oz ones do not. It would have been nice to have a cover for the 9oz candle so I can safely snuff the candle when I'm done with it."
4,21-Jul-20,2,"Great Scent for Lockdown The best thing about this candle was the scent and it looked simple and slightly elegant. the scent was  Fruity and clean. The candle though is another story. The wick would not stay lite. The candle would not burn to the edges. One night when it was lite, the whole top of the candle began to burn, the whole wax top not just the wick. I had to put a plate on top of it to put it out or else get some marshmallow and have a campfire roast. It was a problem candle, to stay the least. It was dangerous, actually. I lamented it's loss but had to throw it out as it was just to hazardous to continue to burn. Great Scent though. Beware and if you get it, DO NOT LEAVE IT ALONE. SERIOUSLY!"
4,22-Aug-19,2,"This One Smelled Funky- Black Amber I bought several different scents from this Brand & I REALLY Liked all the other scents!  I got different ones because you don't know which one smells like what through the computer -duh.  I will give those a good review.  But I'm warning people this one smelled like sweet, burnt hair oil.  I gave it away. YOU CAN SAFELY GO WITH ANY OTHER SCENT.As for the candle ITself, it lasts a decent amount of time, comes with a handy sealed cover, and has a reasonable price.  The larger ones definitely are a good value for the money and look pretty in a black glass jar.  I did find myself trimming the wick to avoid smokey residue in the air but that's normal with all but the most expensive candles.  Will buy again, just not this scent."
4,30-Mar-20,5,"It works! Unfortunately, the stove hood in the house where we're living is not ventilated to the outside; so, the odors of anything we cook on the stove linger in the house when it is too cold to open the windows. We had tried a few candles we already had, but, as soon as we blew them out, you could smell the odor from dinner. When I saw this candle, I figured it was worth a try...AND I was right! It does a great job of dealing with the odors if you burn it while you're cooking; and, since it's soy, it does not smoke or leave a residue as some other candles will. I will definitely buy another one. I love the fragrance also! :)"
4,23-Oct-19,5,"Great value, great scent that makes the whole apartment smell great. This candle is great. It's my first soy wax candle and I'll be sticking to them from now on. The smell is incredible and I had this candle burning for about 2 hours in my bedroom and my entire apartment smelled wonderful. It's the first candle I've had to actually make the entire apartment smell nice. It comes with a nice kid and very stylish labeling/styling. I think it looks great and it smells even better. I can tell this candle should last awhile as long as I have the self control to not burn it all the time. I got the Tobacco Spice and Vanilla scent and it is really great, I plan on trying the pineapple evergreen next."
4,5-Jun-20,5,"Sweet coffee smell I bought the Espresso Bean scent. I could smell the candle as soon as I opened the box (it was still packaged and there was a separate part of my order in the same box, so the smell was pleasantly strong). It smells very espresso-y and a little sweet; it‚Äôs a strong smell but not overwhelming. I have it in my bedroom and the scent will easily fill the room when lit. I‚Äôve burned it for a total of ~12-18 hours and it has only used ~1/2 inch and it‚Äôs retained its scent. Very happy! Would be a nice gift for someone too!"
4,31-Mar-20,5,"High quality candle!!! DOES NOT SMELL LIKE MEN's COLOGNE. It still smells good though. But we all know what cologne smells like. This is definitely more of a candle-y (wax) smell.First off - you need to already be a pretty clean person. This may be a light scent but it is very smooth, mellow, and makes a statement.  It is easy on the nose but it fills a room. This isn't a candle to keep on for a while. Maybe just during an evening or when you want to make a statement as soon as someone new walks into a room.Back to being ""clean."" Really, you just need to have a place that doesn't already smell bad. Or is not covered with odor that you are pretty much blind to. --- Like how those febreze commercials used to be when describing what WE smell versus what OTHERS smell... ""this is what you smell"" versus ""this is what your friends smell"" and then the car turns into the dumb and dumber Dog car. You get me? With that said - this candle will be perfect for a living room or a bedroom. It is too seductive for an office! Lol! Unless you're into that...OVERALL - pricey, yes. But it's worth it. I wish it was a bit bigger though."
4,24-Oct-20,5,"Great Scebt with a Clean Burn! I was a little skeptical the first time I purchased these candles since they're a little pricey (6oz for $14.99), but decided to go for it anyway. The candle arrived quickly, well packaged, and undamaged. Upon opening, I instantly noticed the AMAZING smell and I was hooked (I purchased Sexy Man.) This candle burns so clean and for the size of the candle, the scent really carries/lingers. I typically light my candles daily for a few hours at a time, and a 6oz candle usually lasts me a week or two. Since my first purchase, I have bought 4 more times. I would highly recommend!!!"
4,28-Jul-20,5,"Caramel coffee scent, not too overpowering, looks modern and sophisticated This is my first scented candle and I really like it! I love the coffee shop smells and got the expresso bean and I'm very happy. The candle is not too big, about a size of a fist (slightly bigger), the design and the label is very sleek, vintage and modern. It looks good too. This one smells more like caramel than coffee, so it'll feel more sweet than that baked, deep coffee scent. Only con I'd say is that it's not too much product for how much you pay, and that when putting off the candle there can be some black smokes (not too serious). Overall I'm very happy with the purchase!"
4,9-Nov-20,5,"Love the smells and burn times! I can't get over the Sexy Man candle. I love it and have given it as gifts many times.  These candles have been the longest burning I have found from Amazon.  They have burned evenly if I burn them long enough.  If I only burn for an hour, I have had a few (3 times maybe) where it hasn't burned evenly.  It's been self correcting when I leave it burn for several hours after that.Since working from home, after I clean up the kitchen and shift over to start working, I always light the candle.  It will burn for at least 4-6 hours (M-F) and still last about 3 weeks/month"
4,25-Mar-20,5,"Great scents, great quality Brown Sugar and Oud scent is my fourth Lulu Candle ‚ÄîI had to look up ‚Äúoud‚Äù ‚Äîit‚Äôs a lovely, calming layer of floral (I think) that adds a level of maturity to the brown sugar scent‚Äî- my other three were apple/cinnamon, sugared pecans, sexy man‚Äî these look like small, one evening candles, but they last and last and infuse the air with pleasant scents‚Äînot like walking into a Hallmark store scent or into an incense saturated record store‚Äîthe scents are just pleasing, boyfriend isn‚Äôt sputtering because they are too girlie. In short, I love scented things and these candles are special favorites of mine."
4,18-Dec-19,5,"This is my sexy man, I melt with this candle This is a part of a Christmas present (so I don‚Äôt know the longevity) and I‚Äôve been looking for the ‚Äúperfect‚Äù scent for my Boyfriend (admittedly sprung)... and after many scent overloaded holiday shopping headache missions my gf said she was tapping out on helping me find the perfect manly but, non Teakwood, leather, or cigar smoked flannel scent... (no offense to teakwood actually like it but it‚Äôs not what I wanted) I wanted the scent memory I have of him, on a fresh Saturday morning, after our showers, ready for our day, that moment when you hug your man and its a mix of his clean fresh laundry t-shirt, a light cologne and hint of vanilla... I just melt!!!! I loved this scent so much I‚Äôm literally buying 2 of the 9oz now (I bought the 6oz originally) so I can keep one and gift him two..."
4,14-Apr-20,5,"The BEST coffee candle I've ever smelled in my life! No joke. I've been looking for a good coffee scented candle to make my home office feel a little more like a coffee shop (since all of them are closed right now). I've purchased 3 candles that claim they are coffee scented. They lied to me. They all smell like baked goods and candy. I was a little hesitant to order this candle online without being able to smell it. But let me tell you, I am SO GLAD I did! This is the real deal folks."
4,10-Apr-20,2,Dislike the smell - No. 14 I bought this because I read it smells like the Le Labo Santal candle. It doesn‚Äôt. It smells like an old lady perfume a little bit. Gave it 2 stars because it‚Äôs not the candles fault it doesn‚Äôt smell the right way. It‚Äôs also covered in stickers about not leaving a burning flame going. I can‚Äôt get them off without leaving a sticky residue all over the candle. If someone doesn‚Äôt have enough sense to blow out a candle before walking away then they shouldn‚Äôt be allowed to buy a candle in the first place
4,29-Jul-19,4,"The ""Fresh Linen"" fragrance is fresh indeed! FULL TRANSPARENCY:  I was motivated to write this review (which, at the time of posting is entirely honest) by the manufacturer's promise of a ""free travel tin candle!"" as a reward.  I will be certain to update this review if I have any unpleasant experiences as I burn this candle to it's end.The fragrance is well crafted and complex with subtlety in mind.  The scent is pleasantly present both while just sitting and looking nice on a shelf, and while alight, but hasn't at all overpowered the (10' x 15') room it's in.  I've only had mine burning for roughly 4 hours since I've received it (shipping took 2 days in my case), and I was truly surprised by how little of the wick and wax have been spent thus far.  First impressions are quite positive.  Only gave 4 stars until I see the candle through to it's end."
4,30-Mar-20,1,"Waste of money, no scent. The reviews made me so hopeful that I almost just bought 3 on a whim but I am SO GLAD I didn't.I bought the Lavender Musk and it has literally no scent when you first smell it.No biggie, I thought if I lit it then itd be more promising.The wick on this candle is short and hardly burns. I had the candle burning for an hour and a half and there was a very small pool of melted wax around the wick and that's it.Again, zero scent."
4,17-Aug-20,5,"Nice scent This candle has a nice scent and has lovely packaging. My husband has alergies and wanted a candle that was all natural so I chose this soy candle with one of my favorite fragrances which is coffee ""Espresso Bean."" It's not overpowering but it's a nice scent that I can have in my office as I work that smells great but not ""too much"" for my husband. It's only the first day that I've used it so I can really speak to the longevity but there's no reason to expect that it won't burn well since it's fine right now."
4,18-May-20,5,"Best Value! This is my second purchase from Lulu Candles. The first, Pineapple Evergreen, pleasantly reminded me of my vacation to Hawaii last year. The scent filled my large room, surprisingly, from such a small container. It was clean and slow burning too, so it was a clear win all-around. My second purchase was the larger 9 oz Jasmine Oud Sandalwood. I‚Äôm happy to say the quality is consistent, I couldn‚Äôt be happier having purchased both. Lulu Candle has gained a customer for life. I hope they never stop doing what they do best!"
4,15-Sep-20,5,"Smells like real coffee I saw a candle I wanted at Anthropologie that was espresso scented.  It was more expensive than I wanted to pay at the moment.I'm glad I found this one on Amazon.  It smells just how I wanted it to - like real espresso, not a sickly sweet fake latte scent.  I'm using it as an air freshener in my new car.  I just take the lid off, I don't burn it.  It doesn't give me a headache the way perfumy air fresheners do.  Coffee bean is one of my favorite fragrances.  I don't drink coffee but I love the way it smells!  I will definitely try other scents!"
4,5-Mar-19,5,"My new favorite candle I have loved soy candles for years. I‚Äôve got allergies and I‚Äôm scent sensitive, but these candles are amazing. I got blueberry cobbler and I could smell it through the packaging while still in my mailbox ?üòÇ?üòÇ Surprisingly it wasn‚Äôt an over powering smell considering how strong it was. I‚Äôm definitely going to order more. Just keep in mind that the blueberry cobbler is pretty strong, but I love it ?ü•?"
4,23-May-20,5,"Amazing fragrance, long-lasting, clean ingredients I ordered the 9 oz candle in Juniper Leaf. I find the smell to be AMAZING! I'm not well-versed in scent descriptions, but this is a pine-like smell reminiscent of Christmas. Regardless of the holiday, it carries a fresh, crisp smell I can imagine myself enjoying year-round. Having previously purchased a Lulu candle, I am confident this too will prove long lasting. I know that my last candle burned significantly longer than those cheap gems at Trader Joe's and it was less than a 1/5th of the way down... which would've been a whole candle had it been Trader Joe's. If I had to guess, a 6 oz candle lasts about 30 hours (2 month use, 3-4 hours/week, 4.35 weeks/month). I'm expecting another 12-15 hours from this one (9 oz). I recommend the buy and will be purchasing again, though trying out new scents."
4,8-Jun-20,5,"Just a dude buying a candle... So I'm just a dude on the hunt for decent smelling soy candles to keep my pad smelling fresh since I'm probably a little old for incense or body spray doubling as air freshener. I came across the Lulu candles and the reviews looked decent and what can I say, I like the label and font too so thought I'd give one a shot. I almost bought the Fresh Linen scent but after reading some reviews I was intrigued by the Pineapple Evergreen aromatical concoction.On arrival, I lit the Pineapple Express, I mean Evergreen candle and was pleased enough by the overall scent. I prefer milder scents and definitely not big on overpowering aromas from candles, incense, cologne, soap, body wash/spray, deodorant, laundry detergent or, (god forbid) potpourri or meatheads at the gym so the Lulu PE candle passed that test with no headache or smoky, burning wick either.I'd rate the Pineapple / Evergreen ratio at around 75 / 25 with pineapple being the main note and evergreen very subtle. The pineapple is close to the limit of aerial sweetness for me and I'd actually prefer a closer to 50 / 50 ratio for a little more rugged outdoors-iness of the evergreen scent. Overall, I'm happy enough and will probably give the Fresh Linen a shot next."
4,15-Aug-20,5,"Devine When the candle arrived, I was surprised how small it was. When I started burning it, I was amazed how Devine the smell is, how long lasting it is. I purchased it a while ago and I burn it a few hours a day. Less than quarter of it is gone. If you like coffee, you need this in your life. It is doesn‚Äôt take a lot of space, but it packs quite a punch when it comes to the smell. It even smells when not burning, which I appreciate. Sometimes I leave it open on my night stand just so that I can wake up smelling coffee. Highly recommend."
4,11-Dec-19,5,"Beautifully balanced fragrance and a stronger throw than many candles that cost more The scent is AMAZING! The throw isn‚Äôt as strong as I had hoped- (still pretty darn strong though - better then yankee) and the reviews on how strong of a throw were the reasons why I purchased it. The candle is very small- but I knew that based on the customer pictures and etc. so far I really really like it, and only time will tell if it was worth it (based on how many hours I can get of burn time) Will probably buy more!Update: I have bought 3 candles total now and they are all amazing! These snd benevolent candles are the best easily!New update: I am obsessed with these candles! Can‚Äôt wait to buy them in every scent and gift them for this holiday season!"
4,18-Aug-20,5,"Pineapple Evergreen Smells Spicy (in a good way) It‚Äôs really difficult to buy a scented product online. Especially when you‚Äôre as picky as I am. This scent seemed to be the most popular, so I gave it a try. I typically only like spicy and natural scented candles. Nothing sweet like vanilla or cookies. Nothing like linen or ocean breeze. Nothing floral. If you feel the same, go for the pineapple evergreen! It‚Äôs actually a spicy scent...something I would burn during the fall months. Kind of reminds me of Bath and Body Works‚Äô ‚ÄúLeaves‚Äù scent. I‚Äôm on a mission to rid my house of a chemicals, so I‚Äôll definitely be trying other lulu candles."
4,19-Nov-19,5,"Great purchase ‚Äì¬†will be rebuying other scents for sure. In true prime fashion, the item showed up in no time. The packaging was well thought out and safe. The scent I got, Fresh Linen, is very clean and that's what I wanted. I will be trying out some other scents but I was looking for something that didn't say ""oh what's that great smell?"" but more of ""wow it smells clean in here."" The candle achieves that for me. I can't say much about longevity since this is the first day using it, but it seems to be going well. You always have to make sure to cut the wick about 50% before you relight ‚Äì¬†I think that's what most people make the mistake of doing (or not doing), and end up killing the life of the candle by like 30%. Overall very satisfied with the purchase. Great price for the item and great gift item too."
4,27-Jul-20,4,"Original, natural scent with good staying power I wasn't familiar with this company at all but was pleasantly surprised to find a quality candle on Amazon. The scent I ordered is called ""jasmine infused bergamot"" and it is precisely that what it reminds me of. I think the bergamot gives it a slightly ""clinical"" smell, but it also slightly warm and exotic, the latter was what I was expecting. I would probably not order the same scent but would definitely like to try others. The smell has a good permanence in rooms such as bathroom or a small bedroom. A nice find!"
4,30-Jan-20,5,"Clean Linen Small but Mighty Purchased 6oz Fresh Linen. Smells like clean laundry or basically laundry detergent to me. Smells good though. I was taken back by how small the container is but I didn‚Äôt put any thought into what 6oz really looks like. Almost sent it back because of this but then read the long burning reviews so I assume I‚Äôll get my monies worth(remember ladies it‚Äôs not about the size but how good it performs;). The aroma fills up my 1 bedroom 800sq/ft apartment nicely. The candle size is maybe 3.5‚Äù tall by 3‚Äù wide, single wick."
4,23-Aug-20,4,"Great Smell with Vanilla base note Nice packaging and smell. The base note is vanilla with some sharp notes. I knew from the other reviews that is is a very small sized candle, so no surprises there. It only takes 4-5 minutes for the room air to be fragrant. It is hence is possible that this small jar will last you long. I have subtracted 1 star because I would have liked it to be bigger.Overall - Great Candle! I would buy it again."
4,31-Oct-18,3,"Lasts, but where's the scent? Let's just say... This candle has a very subtle lemongrass scent. I was looking for a candle that was a bit stronger, especially if lit for several hours (which it was). I asked my boyfriend, upon arriving home, if he noticed any scent in the room and he said no! That's when I knew I was not crazy nor were my olfactory glands malfunctioning.To be fair, this candle does last a LOOONG time."
4,7-Aug-19,5,Good quality candles with a long burn time I bought these candles because my husband is allergic to the bath and body works jar candles with strong synthetic fragrances and would always complain about my candle lighting habit. Not only does he tolerate these candles well as they dont aggravate his allergies and/or asthma but he actually enjoys the fragrance which is relatively light and not overpowering. (I bought the pineapple evergreen scented candles but will be trying a few more scents since these got the OK).
4,18-Aug-19,5,"Nice scent that isn't overpowering This candle is so perfect for a relaxing scent. It permeates through the space without being overpowering. It appears to be lasting quite some time, but I haven't timed it. I would definitely purchase another and explore the other scents. I ordered the fresh linen and it really does smell like freshly washed clothes."
4,26-May-20,2,"Leaving the Lid on this Candle I was curious to know what ‚ÄúMidnight in Paris‚Äù would smell like so I ordered it. Having never been to Paris before, I can‚Äôt say if this is light, but according to this candle, a midnight in Paris smells like old people. My son said it smells like diapers and old cologne, and my fianc?© said it smelled like an old man powdering his genitalia at the gym (I didn‚Äôt ask how he knows what that smells like). Needless to say, I‚Äôm not a fan of this particular fragrance at all‚Äî maybe other fragrances smell better."
4,27-Jul-20,3,"Definitely odor killing. This candle is VERY strong This candle is great for very stinky homes or very large homes because it is VERY STRONG. I live in a normal city apartment and have a cat. Our apartment isn't smelly, or at least doesn't require a scent this strong. I had it lit for maybe 5 minutes, with all my windows open, before I had to blow it out because the fumes were a lot to handle in such a tiny space. Great candle overall, but caution that the scent is pungent and overpowering. Probably best for homes/apartments that are very large or very stinky."
4,11-Nov-19,5,"Strong scent, attractive candle I love this candle!  I specifically bought this scent because it is meant to eliminate odors and I have two cats.  I wanted a cinnamon candle, but thought this one would be close enough - unfortunately it smells more like apple cider than cinnamon, but that's okay.  It's very strongly scented - I've been burning it on my coffee table but I think I need to move it farther away from me because the smell is so intense.  It does live up to it's odor-eliminating promises.  Very attractive package too.  This candle also gives a part of it's sales proceed to animal charities."
4,26-Oct-19,5,"Perfect bathroom companion I'm not an expert among the candle community, but my girlfriend has slowely help me explore this area. She recently convinced me to buy one myself, but little did I know the true meaning of this ploy. It turns out that I can leave the bathroom with quite an unlovely scent, therefore there was a problem that needed a fix.This candle smells pretty good! The melting wax runs down the sides of the candle like lost tears in the moonlight while I fearlessly drench my enemies down the deep shallow waters of glory. Not too hefty, not too gentle. Just right. The goldilocks enigma.I'm eager to explore new scents after trying Fresh Linen even though I've yet to complete the longevity test, but so far so good. I would recommend this candle."
4,8-Oct-20,5,"Pineapple Evergreen is the perfect WFH candle! I've been trying to make my house more cozy and pleasant since we are constantly at home nowadays.  I purchased three different scents of this candle:1. Pineapple Evergreen --  I love ""tree"" scents but they are usually specially for holiday.  The sweet pineapple balances the woods evergreen nicely.  Its not overpoweringly sweet, fruity, or woodsy -- the scents are nicely balanced. I find this candle energizing and it put it in my home office.  Highly recommend!2. Jasmine, Oud, Sandalwood -- purchased this as its listed as a dupe for the pricey Le Labo Santal 26. Now, because of COVID, I have not smelled the actual Le Labo candle in a long time BUT this is a pleasant candle for the living room that gives off a nice aroma even while its not lit.  Not super sandalwoodsy and heavier on the oud in my opinion.3. Lavender Musk - Was looking for a lavender candle for my bathroom and found this option, which is specially to cover up pet odors.  We have a litter box in the bathroom so I purchased this.  It does smell nice and helps cover up the litter box odors even while not lit - however - the ""musk"" scent is more powerful than the lavender."
4,20-Oct-20,5,"Just what I wanted Smells exactly like what it‚Äôs labeled. Very powerful pleasant scent. Small but mighty! Permeates the room. Love the neutral label design I got the blueberry cobbler- smells kinda like blueberry yogurt. I paired it with the sugared pecans which smells like butter, sugar and salt and softly roasted pecans. Together they smell heavenly. I also got the lemon vanilla. Which is so lovely. It is quite lemony without being like a cleaning product. The vanilla comes thru right behind the lemon. It is like a follow up smell. Does not smell like food but not perfumy either. It just emits this strong, tangy scent followed by a smooth vanilla after smell. Will be getting more of all three. Ordered lemon biscotti also- can‚Äôt wait to smellThat one!!!"
4,22-Nov-20,5,"BUY TOBACCO SPICE AND VANILLA !!! i LOVE this candle. i never write reviews because i really don‚Äôt feel like it. i got the tobacco spice and vanilla and i‚Äôm obsessed with it. the candle is small but it fills you room with a beautiful scent. i have had mine for almost 4 months now and it‚Äôs only half way done. let me tell you i light it a lot too. i had to buy another one the other day just because i love this product so much. highly highly recommend!!!! plus it just looks so dang cute :,))"
4,30-Nov-19,4,"Ideal gifts for those who loves Paris It‚Äôs powdery scent - some traits of Chanel‚Äôs No. 19, which is definitely the Paris theme. Reminds me of Moulin Rouge somewhat and French designers stores.The scent was unfortunate on weak side but the name of midnight communicates the subtlety of powdery scent. On Breezy night - subtle powdery perfume comes from somewhere in Paris... indeed.Also, I like the idea of natural ingredients - soy base and cotton wick.Bought one for a gift and one for myself to try to see and enjoy Parisian scent as we are big fans of Paris.Perfect for any type of gift occasion- for those who are Paris lovers."
4,18-May-20,4,"Smells delicious Let me start off by saying I typically never write reviews. I always read reviews before I buy something,  so I figured I should start now ?üòÇ I love candles and a friend recommended these candles to me, so I decided to give a try. I ordered the smaller crumb cake candle (wasn't sure I would like it so I chose small). Y'all I could smell the candle from inside the bag!!! Lots of times candles smell good but don't put off the same strong scent when lit....this does not disappoint. I will be ordering again for sure. My only con, which is my fault since I didn't read the dimensions was the candle was much smaller than I anticipated. The true test will be how long it lasts as I light candles every day!!!"
4,1-Sep-20,5,"Espresso Bean- like walking into a coffee shop... Mmmm I would describe this scent as 'pure deliciousness'! It's a lot smaller than it looked online, but the bright side is that I'll be able to try a different scent sooner rather than later?üòâ.The scent I purchased is Espresso Bean. Im The candle is a lot smaller than it looked online, but the bright side is that I'll be able to try a different scent sooner rather than later?üòâ.The scent I have can be over overpowering in a bedroom with the door closed (and will definitely mask any smell due to its potency). But in a larger room, it's perfect and makes you wanna snuggle up in front of the TV with cookies and milk ?üç™?ü•õ."
4,27-Sep-20,3,"Tuscan Tangerine: all soap, no citrus The jar and label are classy and clean, the scent is incredible saturated and strong, but omg, Tuscan Tangerine smells nothing like tangerine (or anything I associate with Tuscany) and it just smells like soap. I couldn't even say that it smells floral; it just smells like old-lady soap. Really disappointed because a few minutes burn has filled up my great room with the worst scent. If this had really been a citrus scent, I'd be in heaven..."
4,10-Nov-19,3,"Lemon and Vanilla Bean received smells nothing like lemon or vanilla. I've purchased two of these candles. The first was pineapple and evergreen, which was ok, but after burning a while it was a little too strong for my preference. So I decided to try the lemon and vanilla bean. Just received it, and it really smells like a strong ""fresh linen"" scent, which some people really like, but I can't stand (gives me a headache like walking down the detergent aisle at a grocery store). No trace of lemon or vanilla at all... Maybe it was mislabeled? I don't know. Just disappointed, because they do look very nice and seem like they probably last decently long."
4,17-Oct-20,5,"Surprisingly Autumnal Like many other reviewers, I was surprised by the pleasing combination of scents: pineapple and evergreen. It reminds me of fall! I was glad I took a chance and ordered this for a fresh scent to my home. I love fragrance and how it can transport a person to a different place; a memory. It doesn't even need to be lit to smell the scent. I have been enjoying the scent wafting over since I got it (yesterday)."
4,4-May-19,5,"Love these soy candles! I love everything about these candles! Made in the USA, hand poured and pure soy... what‚Äôs not to love? They burn for a very long time and they burn evenly which is important. The scents I‚Äôve purchased so far have been wonderful. I‚Äôm currently hooked to blueberry cobbler and lemon biscotti. Every time I light them it smells like a bakery. The simplicity of packaging is clean and minimal. Although they seem small they pack a punch and fill the entire house with fragrance. These would make wonderful gifts as well. Overall I‚Äôm 100% satisfied and would recommend these to all candle lovers who appreciate a quality product."
4,5-Dec-19,1,"Very faint scent, but advertise as a speciality scented candle. I wanted to purchase a candle that had a great scent and that could create a nice aroma in a room. I purchased two of these candles.  The scent scent is very faint (on both) and does not create an aroma in the room which Is part of the advertisement by the vendor.  THe scent is barely recognizable (very weak) when you walk directly up to the flame. Also, the flame (wick and wax) does not even provide a good flame. I threw both candles away."
4,2-Dec-19,5,Love!!! Great Quality! I bought this candle (Candied Pecans) for myself and absolutely LOVE it!!  It burns for a very long time and has a wonderful smell. I have a really large kitchen/dining area and the whole room smelled lovely.I loved this candle so much that I bought it again as part of a gift for someone. Highly recommend!
4,8-Jun-20,5,"It's Just Really Good I searched long and hard for a citrus candle that would steal my heart, soul, and replace the $1 one I found and couldn't find an easy way to buy again without going into a store, because I'm super depressed.This candle (the lemongrass one!) is a delight. It's scent is strong, very strong, but not overwhelming to me. I'm usually super sensitive to scents, which is why I'd usually rather just set a piece of wood on fire and watch it for a few hours, but I just really wanted a citrus candle, and I can't read, but I'm pleased with the results.If you have issues with candles and allergies, this candle will likely be okay for you. I've had no snotty nose or coughing or sneezing. It's just a very strong smell! Pleasant, but strong.So far, it's lasted several nights of be burning it. Long lasting, good smell - like seriously, this'll fill up your whole house with the smell of lemongrass.Overall, girl who is sensitive to candle smells has been able to use it, 10/10, fills a room with lemongrass, you will never have to worry about pet smells ever again because I have five nasty poo hand cats and I can't smell a thing over the powerful smell of lemongrass shoving itself up my nostrils.thanks for reading I appreciate you go get that candle, bud"
4,3-Oct-20,4,"Perfect Scent, Kind of Small I love Nag Champa incense but my 93 yr old mother lives with me and can‚Äôt tolerate the smoke. This little (one of the reasons it lost a star- size) candle has my sitting room/studio with the constantly lingering scent.  I hope it has burning longevity but at 6oz I‚Äôm not counting on it. Giftable because it‚Äôs simple without any overly decorative packaging. Fits any decor. My only complaint is price. A bit costly for its size."
4,11-Aug-19,5,"Smells so good! Love the Pineapple Evergreen scent! It‚Äôs sweet, fresh, and brightens up a room. Burns pretty slow from what I can tell but I‚Äôm no candle expert.Roommates didn‚Äôt care for it too much- said it smelled strong even when no burning. I think they are just over sensitive and picky. You can faintly get A whiff of it when not burning but nothing crazy- they just like things their way ?üôÑAlready bought more!"
4,30-Jul-20,5,"Well worth the money- best quality candle I have ever found. Let me begin by informing you that I am CHEAP. I had knots in my stomach as I submitted my order for a $14.95 candle. Upon arrival, my own inspection of the candle confirmed the raving reviews of the product. The candle is VERY slow burning while emitting a perfect intensity of fragrance. $14.95 turns out to be quite the bargain for this candle, simply because it has the capacity to noticeably out-last other candles.I purchased the Cedarwood-Mango scent and love it. The light fruitiness and earthiness of the scent complement each other very well."
4,9-Aug-20,5,"Happy place. I have just started to appreciate the effects of candles since being home so much. The pineapple evergreen is a very nice scent, similar to volcano (another popular, more expensive candle I have purchased recently). I have also purchased sandalwood mango and it's nice too, a little less fragrant than the pineapple. I would agree with the claim that these are highly scented candles as you can smell 5-10 minutes after lighting. Seem to burn evenly too."
4,9-Feb-20,5,"Smaller than I expected, but packs a quite pleasing punch Lit it for about four hours earlier and it barely went down. Which, in my opinion, means great longevity. I thought I had ordered a bigger one, but I may just be confusing it for a different brand, so I was kind of unnerved by how small it was when I first opened it. It's definitely bigger than those tea lights or those little cheapo candles that come in gifts. It's a good size, just I woudn't call it large or medium. But it seems to last forever."
4,11-Apr-20,2,Awful cheap artificial smell I got the Pineapple one and it smells disgusting. It has a cloyingly sweet smell. It‚Äôs really really gross. I have a friend who got another scent and it was too strong also. I will not be rebuying this brand because they scents are too strong and very cheap smelling.
4,7-Apr-19,5,My new favorite candle! I looked at so many candles on Amazon before deciding to give this one a try.  I chose it because it was a great price for the size and I thought the scent (pineapple evergreen) sounding intriguing.  I'm so happy I did!  This is a beautiful candle--I'd feel really good about gifting this to someone with it's really pretty white jar and clean black and white label.  And it smells even better than it looks :)
4,27-Feb-20,4,"These candles are great! 3rd purchase! This is my third purchase of a Lulu Candle. This time I got the Black Amber. I find that it smells like another scent but just can't put my finger on it. It's pleasant, but I don't find it as strong as my first 2 which were the tobacco one and the lemon one. But, I still think these are great candles and release a nice amount of scent without being overwhelming which is nice and unexpected from a candle its size. Yes, I get a free smaller candle for writing this review, but as I always say, I wouldn't want another one of these candles if they weren't good so this is my honest opinion."
4,10-Dec-19,2,"Great throw, horrible scent. This is the foulest smelling candle I‚Äôve ever encountered. It smells exactly like cheap perfume, it‚Äôs so cloying and overwhelming. It reminds me of a rich lady with horrible taste who smells like she bathes in her crappy parfume. Anyway, if you like cheap perfume scent that will fill your home, this is the candle for you!"
4,13-Dec-19,5,"Best candle purchase... Lemon biscotti for the win The lemon biscotti is heavenly!!! I lit the candle and went upstairs to put away laundry. After about 15 minutes I was shocked I could actually smell the candle from all the way downstairs. Like other reviewers, I didn't want to fork over $20+ on a Bath and Body candle so I gave this line a shot and am so glad I did. It has been burning for about an hour and the wax hasn't moved down at all like most other candles.It smells like lemon cookies... I'm a huge fan."
4,29-Jun-19,5,"Potent, long-lasting I bought this to replace the Lemon Verbena candle they used to carry, and (I think?) it was discontinued.Quickly became one of my all-time favourite candles, and also, scents. It is quite potent. Sweet, clean, lemony. Fragrance lingers after extinguishing; you can also smell the candle itself after it has been melted down a bit. Lasts a good while. Wick doesn't always burn totally clean, but it is hard to notice. I keep one in several rooms.Would absolutely gift this to someone who enjoys scented candles.10/10 will buy these again."
4,3-Apr-20,3,"Too Sweet I was really looking forward to this candle due to all of the high reviews, however, I wasn‚Äôt that pleased. First, it‚Äôs very small for a $20 candle ‚Äî height of my palm. The smell, though may be good to some, is nearing on too sweet. Mine arrived without a lid which I would have loved if it was included, but maybe they can add that later on. I personally wouldn‚Äôt purchase this scent again."
4,21-Jan-20,4,"Lovely scent This candle has such a lovely scent. Clean, simple, and relaxing. It is small for the price, but with that said I‚Äôve been burning it for the majority of 2 days and still have 2/3 of it left. This could be due to the slow burn. If you like a candle with a sizable flame or solid burn, this isn‚Äôt your candle. The burn is very slow and the flame at times looks like it‚Äôs barely lit. I give the throw a 7/10. It fills up our large bedroom after about 30 minutes. Overall I would recommend!"
4,17-Feb-19,5,"A coffee lovers dream The candle is AMAZING ! I LOVE coffee so this is a coffee lovers dream candle. I just wish for the price the candle was bigger !It is slow burning. Yet, the aroma fills the house in such a short amount of time!The pictures are of the candle next to a grande cup. I believe I bought the 9 oz"
4,23-Dec-19,5,"Pineapple/Evergreen is CHEERFUL! I was enticed by the idea of ‚ÄúPineapple Evergreen‚Äù. My holiday guest here in Colorado is from Miami so it sounded like a fun fusion. As soon as I opened the shipping box I could smell it and it was SOOO GOOD! Sweet AND grounding! I haven‚Äôt lit it yet but its perfume is already bringing a very cheerful vibe into the house!Let me add, now that it has finally burned all the way down, that it lasted for TWO MONTHS! I usually burn a candle 2-3 hours at a time and lit this one at least once a week. Today I am shopping for a new scented candle and came straight to the Lulu selection because I know for a fact that the quality here is excellent."
4,30-Aug-20,5,"Smells Wonderful! I just received my candle and as soon as I opened the box, the fragrance filled my space.  It is a little smaller than I'd hoped and I wish it had a lid, but I think it will provide a wonder fragrance without being lit...so maybe it's better to not have a lid.  I enjoy the ambiance of candles during the fall and winter months but so many have toxic ingredients.  I'm hoping this brand will be my new alternative."
4,20-Nov-20,5,"LOVE the scent! Great candle. The Pineapple Evergreen totally delivers. I was skeptical at first, thinking that one of the scents HAD to overpower one of the other and wondering which would stand out when lit - but they legitimately meld together so beautifully. It's neither too tropical or too piny, making this a year-round candle. It does get a little strong/sharp when you let it burn for a couple of hours, but I just use that as my signal to blow it out. The scent lasts well after the flame is put out, and I even find myself catching whiffs the next day when the candle is unlit and just sitting on the table uncapped. I will absolutely be repurchasing Pineapple Evergreen (and in the larger size) when the time comes to replace mine. Thank you LuLu!"
4,11-Jan-20,4,"The scent of Laundry I've been searching for a candle for a while that gave me that reminiscent smell of laundry and I think I've found it. It bring backs memories of falling into bed with fresh sheets and everything feeling so serene. Once this candle runs out, I will definitely be purchasing again.Pros:smells like laundrystrongly scented, even without burning itCute designCons:I found a hair upon opening my candle (kinda weird and random but definitely a con)It's smaller than expected"
4,21-Nov-20,5,"Could so many people be wrong? Nope! The rave reviews stating how pleasantly surprised previous buyers were by the pairing of pineapple and evergreen were spot on. While I would have tried the brand based on my love of candles (likely rose or vanilla scents), I would have never purchased this scent on my own. Others obsession with this fragrance led to curiosity and I was not disappointed. Note: Previous to this purchase, I‚Äôd bought a different brand and experienced issues with burning the wick. I purchased a candle warmer/hot plate so as not to waste quite a bit of money. After the 3rd burn of this candle, the wick was too close to the wax to burn again so I switched to using the warmer and we‚Äôre still enjoying it!"
4,6-Jul-20,4,"Lemon Vanilla Bean review ?üçã Burns pretty clean compared to paraffin candles(like a popular Yankee).The scent itself is very pleasant. I was expecting more vanilla in the scent, but it's more like a very light sweet lemon with the smallest hint of Vanilla. Overall it's not bad and you won't be overwhelmed by this scent. If you like a kind of tarty lemon scent...with the ever so smallest amount of vanilla to make it a bit more homey, this would be it."
4,6-Aug-20,5,"Amazing cherry pipe tobacco fragrance! I received this scent in a trio gift last Christmas an absolutely fell in love with tobacco spice and vanilla. The  pineapple /evergreen was also great. I haven't tried the last one yet. Tobacco spice i a rich warm scent with a hint of cherry. This reminds me of cherry pipe tobacco which was sold in the store I worked in as a teenager.It is also similar to the Margot Elena fragrance Kabuki, which is my go yo fall fragrance. This will be my go to fall home scent! I would recommend this as a gift. The scent isn't annoying to my husband who is very sensitive to fragrance. So very happy to have found this!"
4,4-Aug-19,5,"I Gaurentee if your looking for beautiful Candles, LuLu is it....FACTS!! FORGET ABOUT Yankee Candle, and HOMEWORX By Harry ?üëé?üëé  OMG LuLu Candles are #1  ?üëç?üëç FACTS!!!!

4,23-Jul-20,5,Smells Yummy I love Lulu candles the crumb cake scent is my favorite because my boyfriend loves coffee cake and it literally smells the same as if you were to walk into a bakery I also love that there‚Äôs soy I will not even buy a candle anymore unless it is sore I love Lulu candles the crumb cake sent is my favorite because my boyfriend loves coffee cake and it literally smells the same as if you were to walk into a bakery I also love that their soy I will not even buy a candle anymore unless it is because of all the chemicals in other candles. Thank you LuLu!
4,27-Jan-20,4,"Yup, this candle lasts longer. It really does burn slower than even my Yankee candles. I'm OK with paying a premium as long as they deliver what they promise. So ... Longevity? 100% yes. Giftable? 100% yes. Scent? 90% yes. I was desperately hoping to find a candle with a nice fresh citrus (orange/lemon) scent. Their Wild Lemongrass smells uh-mazing, but not quite as crisp as I was hoping for. I think I can smell the tiniest hint of vanilla, but I still highly recommend it."
4,3-Feb-20,5,"initial thoughts & final review. My room has been top notch lately. Being that I'm very proud of maintaining it, my next idea was to give it a scent. Naturally, my first option was to check amazon. I browsed some candle products and ended up with Lulu candles. Shortly before deciding, I glanced through all the fragrance options. Many varieties to choose from; most of which are quite  intriguing....I figured I'd buy one for starters and if I'm satisfied. I'll order consistently to test all scented candles.  So far, so good. I highly recommend. My first purchase was ""Cedarwood Infused Mango"" Verrrry niceee. Earthy with sweet tones. Thank you!"
4,22-Mar-19,5,"New favorite candle! THE SMELL. Wow! Never would have considered ""Pineapple Evergreen"" before, but thought it sounded interesting and took a chance on it... just delicious. Like fresh cut greens and fresh pineapple juice- A perfect scent for the season change and the sun starting to come out; clean and sweet! Plus, jar is stylish, and candle is indeed decently slow burning. Will be purchasing again!"
4,27-Jun-20,5,"DO YOUR SELF A FAVOR TRY THE PINEAPPLE AND EVERGREEN!!!! I normally go for the woods-y scents like eucalyptus and sandalwood... but this one called me. I thought the combination of pineapple and evergreen sounded different. I took the leap and purchased it. I received it last Saturday, as we were packing to head up to big bear ..we were seconds from missing the delivery ?üöö. So we took it up to our Cabin in Big bear for our little family get away ..  when are host to our cabin sent us the directions to our Airb&b  , it was up this dirt road that led us to our Cabin on EVERGREEN !! I immediately started to burn it .. because how coincidental!!!  After an hour aNeighbor came over and asked us what that amazing scent was ...we were out side grilling but the candle was inside burning... she smelled the pineapple & Evergreen through the the Tri-tip and dogs we were grilling .. I showed her the candle .. she took a pic of it and said that was the best scent ever witnessed in bear bear .?üòâ"
4,22-Sep-19,4,"Love the scent I love this candle for a couple of reasons:1.  It has a lovely, clean scent.2.  It is a soy candle. (Not the unhealthy smokey kind).3.  It burns nicely. Just started using it so I do not know how long it lasts.The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it's a little on the small side, for the cost of the candle. Otherwise, I love it."
4,9-Jun-20,4,"Pretty but maybe I just don't know what Linen smells like. It smells a lot like hotel laundry detergent. Which some people might like, but for me it's a little plasticy. I didn't know how big it was but it's smaller than I expected. The label is cute. It would make a good gift for someone you don't really know."
4,3-Oct-20,1,Second purchase- candle wick wont stay lit This is  Second review for these candles. I bought some more for myself and they would not stay lit. I don‚Äôt know if there is a different WIC being used now or watt but I could not keep any of them lips they were easy to light but they went out about 15 minutes later. I like to burn my candle most of the day so I had to keep reloading. I returned them with a refund from Amazon but I was disappointed
4,6-Mar-19,5,"Long burning & smells great I usually purchase NEST candles, which I still love, but these candles are my second favorites, especially given the price difference. I received the Espresso scent as a gift. I fell in love with the aroma and was amazed by the hours it burned ‚Äì it lasted almost twice as long as my NEST candles. Purchased the Amber, Rose & Sheer Musk and found the scent was much more subtle, but burn time consistent. Nice simple packaging. Great candles. Great gift. Plan on purchasing other scents."
4,21-Jul-20,4,"Amazing scent and burns clean. A little pricey but worth it compared to other candles out there My daughter purchased one before the virus pandemic started and I was diagnosed with cancer. Because I‚Äôve been home ALOT, I started burning this and the scent filled my house with pineapple and made my hard days a little better. The scent is amazing! My only only only issue and not a complaint really because I can deal, but the wick always gets a big ‚Äúhead‚Äù that I have to pull off before lighting again. No matter how long it burns, even for ten minutes... I trim the wick down etc. other than that, no black soot so that is nice. Pricey for sure but during these crazy times it‚Äôs worth the price sometimes for sanity. ‚ù§Ô?è LOL a thought I actually posted this, after buying three more I am bringing it down a way big NONO. The wicks still suck and the last two burned so black I had to wipe the inside of the glass to be able to feel ok about what toxin went into my lungs. Not a wimp, I enjoy lots of toxins and have lived for a long time. Not willing to spend the funds on this."
4,24-Oct-20,5,"Amazing fragrance I can‚Äôt speak to the candles longevity since I received it yesterday, but the fragrance is out of this world!  Right now, I‚Äôm burning Fresh Linen and it‚Äôs exactly that...the smell of sun dried linen.  It‚Äôs absolutely lovely.  Not too strong, but just enough to infuse my home with an amazing freshness.I also purchased the Pineapple and Evergreen scent, mainly because of the unlikely pairing.  What a combination!  It‚Äôs a bright, fresh, fruity fragrance with deep forest-y tones.Love, love, love!"
4,16-Mar-19,5,"Smells great, attractive I was looking for a nice looking candle that also had a strong scent, but not one that was overly fake, floral or sweet. The combination on this is very nice, slightly floral with a warm undertone from the sandalwood and oud. Even gives of a faint Great for a more gender neutral decor with it's black glass. Classy looking."
4,5-Jan-20,5,"Great Smell, Awesome Quality Was looking for a candle that provided a ""manly"" scent that would fill up a the ktichen and living room area of my home.  This product is great!  The candle has a great scent, and the life of the candle is great as well!  I have burned the candle so far, 4-5 hours for 3 days and the longevity of the candle is great!  I am glad to have found this supplier and candle, as I will make the a recurring shipment to my home to ensure this scent is maintained in my house!  Great product, and I highly recommend the purchase!"
4,9-Sep-20,4,Love a candle you can actually smell when it's burning! Just got the apple cinnamon 6oz.  It's small but it has a great scent that isn't too overpowering.  There's a fine line between being able to smell it burning and it being so strong that you can't burn it for long.  I like to keep candles burning a lot of the time and you can't when they're too strong.  This one feels like it would be a good one to light when you have company coming over especially now that it's almost fall.  I didn't pay attention to the size when I ordered it and so was disappointed when I opened the box until I saw the other thing I didn't notice which was that a donation will be given to animal rescue!  That makes it worth spending a little bit more.  And by the way I was ordering late at night and tired and thus all the inattention!!  Looking forward to trying some other scents.
4,29-Mar-20,2,"Not fond of the fragrance I acknowledge it is difficult to buy a scented candle online. That said, I chose this candle in the Jasmine, Oud & Sandlewood fragrance because I had read multiple reviews claiming it is a close dupe to a very popular, much more expensive candle I enjoy. This is not even close. It is fairly strong although I can‚Äôt pick out any of the three named scents. Honestly the fragrance reminds me of a powdery dryer sheet."
4,28-Jan-20,5,Living room smells like a coffee shop I was skeptical about how well they could replicate a coffee scent in a candle. Not anymore. I got home from work and asked the wife did you just make coffee? That's when she pointed out the candle I bought and forgot about. It is that strong and accurate of a coffee scent. Also definitely seems to last a lot longer than her other candles. Been going for a couple hours and it's pretty much where it started. I love it!
4,22-Dec-19,5,"This scent is sooooo calming A friend had a Lulu candle burning in their home so I went online and purchased 3 of the Tobacco, Spice & Vanilla scent. I've had many other candle brands, but this one is my favorite. The scent is so clean. It lasts a long time and simply puts me in a zen space."
4,2-Dec-19,5,"POWERFUL FRAGRANCE! LOVE LAVENDER MUSK! This is my second time purchasing a LULU candle! I don't treat myself often enough to the simple pleasure of lighting a candle but while I was on vacation I brought a LULU candle travel tin with me and used it almost every day. I was gone for 10 days and there is still some candle left too! This fragrance in particular, Lavender Musk, is so calming and relaxing, and it permeated my entire large AIRBNB condo. I loved lighting it at night and then, even after being gone all day, I would come back and my condo still smelled like Lavender Musk. I just ordered the 6 oz but would have gotten a larger size if it was available online. LULU candles aren't very expensive but they smell like a million bucks! And FURR a GREAT cause! LULU please make travel tins for purchase. I would stock up and give them away as gifts. Thank you!"
4,18-Aug-20,5,Love LuLu candles & scents My daughter gave me the smaller LuLu with a pina colida smell & I immediately went to Amazon & bought the Lemon & Vanilla Bean scent. I was slight disappointed it didn‚Äôt come with a nice lid like the one my daughter got me (pic on right). I smell more lemon than vanilla bean but it‚Äôs not overwhelming. Love LuLu candles. My daughter also bought more for friends birthday. Great candles!
4,4-Mar-19,5,"Can't say enough about this candle We absolutely love these candles!  The most recent one we purchases arrived right before we where leaving for dinner.  We opened it up, lit it right away and let it burn while we where out (I know I know you aren't supposed to do that but the candle is inside glass so I didn't worry about it).  When we got home a couple hours later the whole house smelled amazing and the candle barely had a dent in it.  Can't recommend highly enough."
4,19-Mar-20,5,"Best Candle Ever! I absolutely love the No. 31 Lemon Biscotti soy candle by Lulu Candles!!! I am very sensitive to fragrances and strong smelling products/candles, but this candle is absolute HEAVEN!!! It is slow burning, smells divine and my husband hasn't complained about the fragrance either, which is a huge plus! My only complaint is there was only a 6 oz. size available, no larger, but hey...I'll take it!"
4,19-Nov-18,3,"Strong candles These are great! I got several scents and they make the whole room smell. Only downside is that you can't smell then in a store, and since they are strong it would be unpleasant to get one you don't like because it's not easy to ignore the scent.Update: they are great the first several hours you burn them, but not after that. The scent somehow gets a lot weaker and the wick doesn't burn well so it turns into a tiny flame that almost gets burned out by the wax. I got several smells and it happened to all but one candle."
4,29-Sep-20,4,"Awesome scents I originally purchased the Espresso Bean candle because I was curious about the scent.  It did not disappoint! It smells just like a coffee shop!  So I picked up a couple of more scents: apple cinnamon and sugared pecans.  These scent are also amazing.The wick of the apple cinnamon is burning weird (it's only burning the bottom half of the wick so the flame is tiny) and not spreading the scent as well as the other candles.  I will buy this candle again and give it another chance to see if it was just this one candle.As for the sugared pecans, I had it on and my 19 yr old nephew loved it so much he took it to his house for his room. so now I'm having to buy one.  The whole family agreed this one is an awesome scent."
4,13-Jul-20,5,"Ordering some more! Last year, I got rid most of the candles at home because we got tired of their scents and weren't using them anymore.  About a month ago my husband decided to order this candle (sexy man) for his office. I didn't like the idea of spending $15 in a small candle that we were not going to use and I almost asked him to return it... Well, it turns out he has been using it almost every day for the past month and oh my! it smells SO good! he only lights it for a few hours and the whole house gets this amazing scent. It does smell very similar to the perfume Sexy men 212, which I love. Also, although the container is small (we got the 6oz one), it lasts a long time! so the price is worth it.Since it was my husband who ordered the candle, I din't realize there are so many different scents and... well, I am now ordering another scent for the living room."
4,7-Apr-20,5,"Great quality. Great scent. Great candle. Slow burning, great smell. This is at least my second Lulu candle. Of coursse the downside of ordering a candle online is you can't smell it first. But fortunately their fagrance names are pretty accurate, so as long as you have an idea of what you want, you WILL probably be very pleased. The quality is really top notch. I can't imagine anything they could do to improve on it. ABSOLUTELY FIVE STARS."
4,16-Sep-20,2,"Love the smell...disappointed with the quality The headline really says it all. I really like the scent of this candle. For a small 6oz it really fills the room. However, it needs a much thicker wick as it is burning straight down the middle and wasting a lot of the candle in the process. My guess is it's wasting at least 40% of the wax. I'm willing to pay 15 bucks for a small candle, but I expect better quality."
4,21-Feb-20,5,"Yasss. I just got this candle and it is so. good. I hate buying candles online because there is such a disconnect between scent and peoples‚Äô reviews but the Linen scent of this candle is wonderfulllllll. I have bought and returned at least 3 candles hoping for a good, ambient scent to change my house‚Äôs scent from m‚Äôeh to ‚Äúoooooh!‚Äù This is the one. If I was brave I would try other scents but for now I will definitely reorder the linen once it is low."
4,22-Apr-19,5,"Incredible smell and long lasting for the price! This candle is AMAZING. I had a similarly scented candle that I bought at a very high end boutique and was looking for something similar that didn't cost $50. This candle delivers! It has almost exactly the same scent, and I've been burning it non-stop since I bought it, in 1 week it's only gone down about 1/4 of the way! Our whole house smells amazing (even though I'm burning it in just the bedroom) and it is warm and inviting. Definitely great for yourself or for a gift!"
4,2-Nov-19,5,"Best fresh linen scent ever! This candle is AMAZING!! We‚Äôve all seen ‚Äú fresh linen‚Äù scented everything, but this candle REALLY smells as if your linen sheets have dried outside in the breeze of a sunny meadow. I LOVE LOVE LOVE it, and I lit it the first bight, which scented up my whole bedroom in no time. I was amazed too, at the slow burn of the soy wax, which makes this a must have for all my friends s as t Christmas. I just ordered a second one for me!"
4,8-Sep-20,5,The best candle ever Wow! I've tried so many vegan candles on Amazon and this one is by far my absolute favorite. I could smell it before I even opened it. The ocean one is my absolute favorite it smells really good and fresh. Doesn't fill the whole house but will fill up a room. Toxic free and doesn't give me a headache or annoy me after a while with it on. I highly recommend it.
4,2-Oct-20,4,"Great longevity, Pineapple Evergreen overhyped I wasn't a huge fan of Pineapple Evergreen. The candle lasts a good long while... Will stick to soy candles now, don't think the longevity is a characteristic of only this brand. The scent permeates the area more than other brands (Chesapeake Bay) but I wouldn't consider it a room-filler.Would try the candle in another scent. I was a little put off by the price, but I've learned I can't go as cheap as Chesapeake Bay.Significant amount left in the bottom. I'll get it out and melt it on a warmer."
4,7-Oct-20,3,"Inconsistent quality We've purchased half a dozen or more of this candle in particular (pineapple evergreen) and some have been amazing. The longevity isn't too bad, especially considering we work from home and they're burning in several hour increments throughout the day. But the latest candle burnt real dirty and created a lot of soot as you can see on the inside of this candle pictured. But what's worse is that the candle just cracked wide open in several places allowing the remaining wax to leak all over the countertop. It was probably burning for 3 to maybe 4 hours at the point that it suddenly cracked. I'd also say that 1/2 of the candles that we've purchased kept a strong smell after several burns. So again, inconsistent quality."
4,30-Jun-19,3,"Not impressed with the quality/smell Ehhhh... for the price I was expecting this to be super good smelling and just very nice quality! But honestly I'm not very impressed-- this candle doesn't smell that great NOR is it very strong smelling either! I can barely smell it! :( I was very excited for this, but I'm rather disappointed. Oh well! That's the risk you take when you order stuff like this online (aka you can't smell it before you buy it!!)"
4,7-Oct-20,4,Very nice fragrance. A cap on the jar wldve been a good idea!! Its pricy for the size. But very pleasant smell. The packaging is attractive as well. A top/cap WOULD hv made it in to a nice jar later. Giftable..but again too small for what you pay for it. Cant comment on the longevity because I just got two of these yesterday. Giving it 4 STARS for the price! It can be and should be a little bigger. Like atleast 12oz IMHO.
4,23-Jul-20,5,"I love these candles! I love the blend of the blend of the three flavors in this candle, its just fabulous!  I gifted this one to my girlfriend for her new home and she just loves it as well.  I was impressed with the packaging and the beautiful glass container (as some candles are ugly but these are great).  I like that its a bit larger and even happier that I bought two so I could keep one for me."
4,17-Nov-20,5,Light scented and good packaging. Packaging was great. Very secure. No damage on delivery. I could smell the candle as soon as I opened the box (before taking off the insulated packaging paper on the inside of the box). I was expecting a stronger scent after burning the candle. The sent is mild but adds a nice fragrance to my home. I'd try their other scents to see which is my favorite. This was my first purchase..
4,30-Oct-20,5,The best candle I have ever purchased! This candle smells just like sugared pecans!  Opened the box and immediately lit the candle.  It‚Äôs small but completely fills the entire first floor of the house.  I‚Äôm going to order two more for gifts!!!
4,10-Jun-20,5,"A SHELTER IN PLACE TRIP TO HAWAII! I absolutely love my Lulu Pineapple Evergreen candle. I just did a mini makeover of my bedroom/sanctuary and the candle is the perfect addition. The fragrance is very fresh pineapple, just like a drink, pie, or fruit salad I've experienced in Hawaii. We had to cancel our trip to Kauai because of C-19, but this is a much less expensive way to get the ""feel"" of one of our favorite spots on the planet! Don't hesitate to treat yourself with Lulu!"
4,26-Jan-20,3,"nice scent for a small room only Bought the wild lemongrass candle and it smells nice up close but you barely smell it fill the room. I dont think id buy it again because i barely notice the scent in a big room such as my tv room. I then placed it in my small office and in there i could smell it better as the room is a lot smaller. So the scent is a nice one, i just wish it would be stronger to fill up a big room. So for now it makes my office smelling nice."
4,12-Jul-20,5,"Aesthetic & Aromatic This candle has a very nice scent, and it also looks fantastic in my bathroom. Although it's a little on the expensive side as far as candles go, the fragrance more than makes up for it. If you're on the fence, just buy it - you won't regret your decision. Bear in mind that by leaving a review, you are also offered a free ""travel tin"" candle."
4,22-Aug-20,5,"Amazing scent, fast-burning This candle smells amazing! I got the pineapple evergreen sent and I already plan on buying more when this one gets low. The sent fills any room quickly.Update: I had this candle for 8 days and it was done..this was not slow-burning as advertised. I would suggest lighting it for 10 min and then blowing it out. It's not a candle you can leave burning for longer than 10-15 min."
4,22-Apr-19,5,"SMELLS AMAZING Love the smell of this candle. It smells very similar to the chateau marmont hotel candle, which i love, but retails at around $50. This candle really smells great, makes my whole living rooms smell lovely. Will def purchase again. Very pleased with this purchase. Thanks!"
4,9-Jul-20,5,"Probably one of the best candles I've ever had... at a price Honestly my review is 4.5/5... I gotta accept it the candles smell REALLY good, it's the right amount of fragrance to, it doesn't overwhelm you but you can feel it. My problem here is value, even though this is one of the best candles I've ever had probably, $15 for 6oz seems is really pricey, I know this is not the most expensive candle in the world, but still is on the expensive side if you do cost per oz. worth noting, it's not a fast burn but still it's not that much wax, I'll prob buy it again at 9oz.On the other side the glass and sticker are  nice, I use this not only for decoration but I need it to be nice and blend in without disturbing the rest of my accessories, these febreeze stickers are horrible (also that's a $3 candle lol). This one has a nice sticker and glass design."
4,5-May-20,5,"Smells like home! This candle smells amazing. I purchased the sugared pecan candle and its the perfect blend of warmth and sweet. It's a lovely powerful scent without being overwhelming. You can smell it, but it's not too much.. I really dislike when I purchase a candle, walk in the room it's burning in, and can't smell it. This fills my small home with warmth. Totally recommend this if you're looking for a homey, warm, cozy scent."
4,22-Aug-20,5,The best smelling candle I have ever bought. I'm not exaggerating. I bought this because it seemed like a good scent and I needed to get something in quick before I received the candles I usually buy. This is my new staple. I lit it in my bedroom and you can smell it on the whole first level! Plus it's been going for almost 5 hours and I can't even tell if the wax level has gone down. Highly recommend.
4,24-May-20,5,"like I‚Äôve died and gone to heaven Not to gush overlong about a scented candle, but this might be the best thing I‚Äôve ever smelled‚Äî and it‚Äôs lilac and morning glory season here now, so those are strong words.  I‚Äôve purcased the lemon biscotti scent, and it smells not only if lemon, but if buttery crumb, like a key lime pie cooking in the oven.A fraction of a star off for being smaller than one might expect for the price.  No matter, this candle is worth it."
4,22-Nov-20,5,"Smells exactly like a laundry room, in the best way possible! (Fresh Linen Scent) I really enjoy candles and am always on the lookout for new soy candles to try. I had already enjoyed Lulu's Jasmine Infused Bergamot candle and wanted to get a new candle with a more ""everyday"" scent...something I could light that would just make my house smell clean and comfortable, but not necessarily like I just lit a candle. Lulu's Fresh Linen scent does that, after you burn it for a bit the room just smells like you did all your weekend chores and can spend the Sunday afternoon relaxing.  As for the candle itself, it burns cleanly: just what you would expect from a good soy candle. The candle comes with a proper lid too, so you don't lose the scent over time. I will continue to buy Lulu candles because they are 2/2 in terms of scent and performance!"
4,29-May-20,1,"Lost a steady customer. Very nice scent! They could last a little longer but will order again.Update:I. Love. These. Candles! Please, please, please, do not ever discontinue these! You have a lifetime customer in me!2nd update: Why, all of a sudden do I have to dug a trench around the wick for it to stay lit?Final update: you've lost a customer. I just threw away a cake with at least a third of the wax still unmelted. Why? Because the wick burned away. Also continuously have to empty melted wax in order for candle to remain lit.For almost $15 per candle... NOT WORTH IT!"
4,13-Apr-20,5,"Smells light and fresh - Fresh Linen First off, I wanted to say that I did not mean to buy this one. I initially bought the best seller box of 3 but they were out of stock, and my boyfriend picked the fresh linen instead. I like stronger scents but this one is nice if you're looking for a basic, clean, light smell. By the way it burns, I can tell this has pretty good longevity. The wick burns slowly. It smells nice and has a pretty aesthetic. It would be a nice gift and I look forward to trying out the other scents."
4,15-Oct-19,5,"Love this scented soy candle -Pineapple-Evergreen by Lulu Okay I am a scent lover!!!  I LOVE all things scented.  However, I also like to go green as much as possible and feel bad to buy cheap products that destroy the environment or are toxic to my family from all those heavy chemicals and cheap perfumes or scents.  I wanted to try a new candle for fall/winter and change it up a bit, so I started checking Amazon and Google for reviews.  The #9 Pineapple-Evergreen Lulu candle had good reviews and I liked the idea of it appealing to a man or a women.  Well, I am not disappointed one bit.  It is a REALLY pleasant scent.  Not too fruity or woodsy --just an amazing balance of scents that blend together very harmoniously.  I love it and am going to send one to my sister to brighten her day.  It's a perfect gift for any woman.  This will be a repeat candle purchase for me."
4,19-Jul-20,5,"Amazing Smelling Candles I was gifted a Lulu candle for Christmas this year - the Blueberry Cobbler specifically.  It is the best smelling candle I have ever had.  I've gotten compliments from my upstairs landlords on how amazing the candle smells, as well as from visitors to my apartment.  I decided to treat myself and purchase the Blueberry Cobbler candle for myself as well as the Espresso Candle.  I absolutely LOVE both but think the Blueberry Cobbler may be my favorite for its distinct, delicious aroma.  I highly recommend these candles for their amazing smell!"
4,23-Jun-20,5,Love them! I have tried several brands and Lulu Candles are my favorite. You can totally smell them and when you blow them out they don't smell like smoke. They go by faster than I wished but that may be because I am obsessed and I light them all the time.
4,25-Oct-20,3,"Not impressed Smells great, but doesn‚Äôt smell up the whole room. Really only noticeable within 5feet from candle. The candle also does not burn evenly. I made sure to burn for 3 hours my first burn and it still hallowed out instead of evenly. Pretty bummed as I think most of these reviews were inflated in order to get a free travel candle. I would not purchase this brand again."
4,5-Jun-20,4,"Nice fabric scent but it doesn't burn well It smells nice, just as fresh linen smells like, but it doesn't burn well. You can see that it won't burn the sides, essentially making a well in the middle.I can see why others complain about the glass breaking. This glass is considerably thinner than other candles I've seen, so you do need to limit the time you burn the candle for to avoid the glass breaking."
4,18-Aug-20,5,"Smells very nice I first got the candle in the mail and it had melted and hardened again, and the wick was gone.  I contacted Amazon and was sent a new candle.Very nice smell- the lemon and vanilla are a great mix.  It had a pretty strong scent to fill the room.  Not sure about the burn time, because I have only burned it once.It doesn't fully burn all the wax around the sides- but other than that, I like it."
4,18-Apr-20,5,Small but packs a scent punch! When this candle arrived I was very disappointed when I realized what a 6oz candle looked like. ?üòÖ Again when I lit it and the flame was so tiny I thought this thing is a dude! What a rip off!But I took it to my office anyway which is where I intended it to go. I lit it when I got there and by the time it was time to go home the wax was still at the top and the whole place smelled AMAZING. This thing packs a scent punch for sure and is definitely a slow burning candle. I think I would purchase again. ?üòä
4,8-Jul-20,5,Freaking love this sent These are great. I know they are a little small for the price but honestly if you want a quality candle this is what you are paying for which is exactly what this is. The smells is amazing by the way. I‚Äôm a guy so I really wanted some that smells more like men‚Äôs cologne and not fruity or flowery. Love this sent. And it looks great and sleek too. Great little candle.
4,8-Dec-19,5,"Great Candle - No Headaches I got the pineapple evergreen candle and I really like the scent. I wasn't sure about having the house smell like pineapple, but it is really nice. (although, to be honest, I only caught a couple of glimpses of the evergreen scent) It has a great throw, the scent permeated the house very nicely, but it didn't give me a headache, which scented candles sometimes do. I like it."
4,28-Jun-20,5,"Pretty good, small but smells great Honestly never bought a candle without smelling it first. I wanted to get free shipping and bought this and now it‚Äôs my favorite I light it every morning when I get ready. I wish it was bigger :( heard reviews about them blowing up and catching fire which is scary but I am always in the room when it is going and I‚Äôm halfway through it with no problem. I probably will only let the wax get so low b4 I throw it away super thick glass so not worried"
4,19-Sep-20,5,"One candle good candle can change your life! I have to say I've had this candle lit all day, minus the night when we're sleeping for 3 days now and it hasn't barely used half of the candle.  It really is exactly as is stated and smells most wonderful, who knew!  This is now my go to candle company.  Well worth the money, and they package it like you are receiving a gift.  Just beautiful!"
4,20-Jun-20,5,"Smells like heaven I'm in LOVE with this candle and am going to order more when this one runs out! I have the lemon and vanilla bean scent and it smells just as good as it sounds. There are care instructions on the back of the candle (always trim wick, don't light for more than 4 hours at a time, etc) Trimming the wick will make your candle last so much longer!!! It's not a huge candle and isn't meant to be burning all day, so keep that in mind. The quality is fantastic and I love that its soy."
4,7-Jul-20,4,"Cute and clean smelling I just received this candle and really adore the clean look and smell of it. I gave it 4 stars because I expected it to be larger than it is. I‚Äôve become used to the 3-wick candles from Bath & Body Works so thought this would be a little larger because of the higher price. That aside, it‚Äôs a great candle that would make a really nice housewarming gift!"
4,26-Aug-20,5,"So good I have to assess whether or not visitors are worth burning it for! These candles - Amber Rose & Musk and Lemon Vanilla - are my absolute favorite right now.  I burn plenty of candles routinely.  But, these...these are so good I tend to save them just for myself.  I keep one bedside and light it about an hour before bedtime.  The scent of these is luxurious AND the throw is impressive.  This is where the value lies.  While smaller than the famous 3-wick candle at a particular larger retail store, this candle permeates the bedroom...and seeps down the hallway.  Is there anything worse than spending money on a candle only to find you have to be thisclose to it to take in the scent?  The jar and labeling are also very nice...making a wonderful gift.  Do yourself a favor...buy this.  Start with the Lemon Vanilla and you will be hooked!"
4,9-Jun-20,5,Love this candle! This is my first Lulu candle purchase and I know it won't be my last! The candle (even the small 6 oz) definitely does its job of carrying a really nice smell throughout our home. Scent = 5 stars. Longevity = 5 stars (We have been burning it almost every day for the past 10 days and it still has a lot left to give!). I can't wait to try the other scents but for now I am loving the Lemon Vanilla Bean! Itis a very fresh (not sweet) scent and doesn't bother my allergies.
4,24-Nov-20,1,Cute The scent is amazing! The label is precious! But this is the most expensive tea light I've ever purchased in 30 years of life. You know when you spend too much on something and you get and it you're extremely disappointed with it and feel sick that you spent so much money on it and you just have to promise yourself to make better purchases with your money in the future? Yeah that's how this candle makes me feel.
4,6-Nov-20,5,"Perfect Study Aesthetic I like to imagine I am Oscar Wilde, sitting by the window in my wingback chair scribbling away a love letter to my dear Lord Alfred Douglas and - oh, what is this? Am I smoking a cigar indoors?Absolutely not!That would be my Tobacco and spicy Vanillas scented candle that waivers in the moonlit night. Yes, as I sit by the dying fire reading my own novel and sipping brandy I can savor the smell of smoky and sweet tobacco without ever having to ruin my linens or books. It's like wandering among the dinner club in the evening without all the stuffy disgruntled elderly men. Just me, my swet books, and a delightfully smoky-sweet candle."
4,27-Aug-19,5,"Most Amazing Candle Ever! I was at an event this weekend and they had this candle burning, it was the most amazing thing I had ever smelt. I took a picture of the label and ordered the candle right away. My mom ordered the wax melts in this same scent and she said they are just as amazing."
4,20-May-20,5,"Smells great, looks great! This candle with its minimalist black label on white glass looks great on my coffee table and the fresh linen scent is spot on! I have found myself wondering who‚Äôs doing laundry then remembering it‚Äôs the candle on a few occasions which is ridiculous because I don‚Äôt even have a laundry machine in my apartment!Full disclosure, I received a lil card with the candle I ordered promising me a free tiny tin travel candle for writing this review but everything I‚Äôve said is the truth and I wouldn‚Äôt have spent this much time/effort to to get a free tiny candle if I didn‚Äôt like the one I ordered in the first place."
4,2-Jun-20,3,Not a fan of the scent I bought this item based on a review. I heard it was a dupe for Santal33 by le labo but it definitely is not. The look of the candle is nice and it goes with my black and white decor but I don‚Äôt think I will burn it because I‚Äôm not a fan of the scent at all. It is probably because I was expecting a completely different scent but I‚Äôm not a fan nonetheless.
4,16-Nov-20,5,"Scent so true to nature! What beautiful candles! The scents are so realistic - the lemongrass makes you think you are standing in a lemongrass field in Thailand. The lemon and vanilla bean smells like a cookie fresh from the oven.  The jars are simple and boxed in a way that would make a great gift. My only complaint is that I wish the candles were a little bit larger. That being said, I'd still buy them again and look forward to trying more of their scents."
4,22-Feb-20,5,Simply the best candles!!! So around Christmas i decided as a clean linen scent fanatic to order several candles from different companies to compare which scent was the best. LuLu candles not only smelled the best but burned the longest and even proved to give their scent strongest while not burning. They are more pricey in comparison but you get what you pay for 100%.
4,16-Jul-19,5,"Amazing soy candle! I was looking for soy candles to replace all of our paraffin candles due to health concerns. After scouring literally thousands of reviews, I settled on this candle in the Pineapple Evergreen scent. OMG - it smells INCREDIBLE! I was hesitant at first because I can't stand fruity smelling candles, but the trusty reviewers swore that it wasn't overpowering, and I'm so glad I got it. It's hard for me to describe the scent but it's definitely not the horrid sweet fruit smell that wafts out from places like Bath and Body Works. It's not overly perfumey - it just fills our living room with a wonderful smell. I can't wait to buy more!"
4,3-Jul-20,5,"Favorite for a candle snob I'm very particular about candles-- they have to burn well, last long, and have a pleasant scent that's strong enough to permeate my 1,800 sq ft apt. This candle checks all my boxes! I saw this on my friends instagram and the unique pineapple evergreen scent caught my attention, its very unique. After using it for hours on end it finally ran out yesterday, so I'll be reordering in a different scent . Love this brand!"
4,19-Nov-20,5,Made my house smell like Christmas! The box that the candle comes in was Saturday and cute! I‚Äôm going to use the box for a Christmas gift (gotta love something you can reuse ‚ôªÔ?è). My mom came over and said my whole house smelled like Christmas! She wanted to know what smelled so good. I had to show her which candle it was. Super happy with my purchase. Just got it yesterday so I can‚Äôt speak much to the longevity.
4,5-Nov-20,5,"Absolutely Addicted! I've now purchased 3 of these candles because the scent is simply incredible...I've ordered the Tobacco Spice & Vanilla, which is very fragrant & fills the entire room with the most wonderfully rich, delicious aroma! Friends & family that have come over are in love with it, too! I especially like that the candle is soy, chemical free & slow-burning....worth every penny! I'll be ordering these for years to come!"
4,29-Jun-19,5,"your nostrils are in for a treat 'Black Amber' is not a mere candle scent; it is a most divine olfactory state of being. When the first wafts of heaven itself hit you, upon unboxing this small gift from God, tears of joy will fill your heretofore sorrow-filled eyes, and your faith in the human experience will be restored. I know this, because I took this journey myself. I write to you now, dear reader, on the Other Side. I don't know what 'Black Amber' means, but I know what lies in store for those who find the courage to make this irrevocable purchase -- pure nasal bliss. Dare to sniff."
4,3-Sep-20,4,"Nice! I can't remember what website I was on but it talked about great Amazon buys and this company was mentioned ...in particular the pineapple wintergreen candle.  There were so many positive reviews that I thought... I've got to try this thing and see.... I have to admit it is a great scent!  You have this wonderful tropical pineapple scent mixed with wintergreen which reminds me of Christmas ...an interesting combination but it works.  Strong smelling, I live in a 2 story and I can smell it upstairs and down...Be prepared to spend... I purchased a 9 oz candle for almost $20... But as they say ...you get what you pay for...and I was very pleased with this candle so I don't feel my 20 bucks was wasted."
4,12-Jun-19,5,Absolutely the MOST amazing scent EVER!! Somehow the scent of this is able to be expansive without the thick heavy perfume smell other candles can have.  I burn it in one room yet my entire place becomes enveloped in the soft fragrance.  And I agree that it does burn slowly.  The times I have walked away and forgotten to blow it out showed how slowly it burns.  Never at any point did the scent feel overwhelming.  Love love love it!! Will definitely be buying more!
4,16-Jun-20,5,"Smells great, lasts ages Immediately after opening the candle, I was thoroughly impressed with its excellent scent. From the size of the candle, I expected it to burn out relatively quickly, but after two 3-hour sessions, it has barely melted off, and fills my living room and kitchen with a warm, masculine scent that perfectly masks the underlying scent of 3 sweaty dudes living here.I will be purchasing more candles from this company."
4,26-Aug-19,5,Small But Mighty! I got the scent Tobacco Spice & Vanilla & it is AMAZING!!! Perfect scent for end of summer/beginning of fall. It is a small candle but it gives scent to a pretty large area!! I have only had it a few days but it seems it will last quite a while!
4,17-Oct-20,5,My favorite new fragrance I was worried that for the price this candle wouldn't last long.  But it does.  I try to burn only three hours at a time but even at that was amazed that my first one is still going.  I picked pineapple evergreen mostly out of curiosity but its an absolutely lovely scent which fills the room.  Came back for two more.
4,19-May-20,5,Just like Coffee! As soon as I opened our mailbox I could smell the enticing scent of the espresso bean candle package! I bought this for work and so I put it in my car (in the garage) on Friday. When I opened the car door Monday morning it smelled so good. I have burned it once so far and it looks like this should have a good amount of use. One of my coworkers thought there was a pot of coffee on since my office isn't far from a small kitchenette area...whoops she was a little disappointed there was no coffee to drink.
4,12-Mar-20,3,"They offer compensation for reviews The candle came with a card that offered a free additional product in exchange for a review on Amazon.  You are supposed to send them an e-mail with a link to your review, and they'll send you a smaller extra candle.The candle itself smells nice, seems to be slow burning, but came with an ugly safety sticker that uses a really tacky type of glue that remains on the glass after you peel it off."
4,12-Oct-20,5,"This takes me back to 1969-  Just Lovely! Midnight In Paris candle by LuLu was a surprising find for me.  I read the descriptive scent and decided to try it and when I received it, I couldn't believe my senses!  Way back in time in 1969, my Mother, Barbra Bettis, worked for the El Paso Herald-Post.  The editor at the time decided to send Mom to Vietnam for the summer to interview ""hometown boys"".  It was a dangerous time and we 3 girls were inconsolable.  We knew we would miss her terribly and to remind us that she was ever-present, Mom took 3 handkerchiefs dabbed with a bit of her signature perfume for us to keep under our pillows.  LuLu's midnight In Paris has the beautiful scent just as Mother's did!  Thank you for the trip down memory lane! --Suzan Chilcoat"
4,10-Aug-20,5,"So good! I purchased both the amber, rose, and sheer musk, as well as the jasmine, oud, and sandalwood. These candles burn forever! The throw is perfect, it makes the whole house smell good without being too overpowering. I was so impressed with the throw for the size of the candle. The jars are a beautiful simple design and show well in our home on top of smelling great. I will definitely repurchase and keep this in mind as gifts in the future! Great product."
4,14-Apr-20,5,"When you miss the smell of the coffee house! I've found myself missing the aroma of coffee beans at my favorite coffee house.  After reading numerous reviews, this one was recommended as actually smelling like coffee.  It does! I also like that it's soy, so it burns much cleaner.  I don't think it will last super long, but it's way less expensive than my trips to Starbucks!"
4,12-Oct-20,5,WILL BUY AGAIN! Oh my god! This candle is really great at smell and longevity. I personally like this sandalwood smell. however the scent might be strong for some of you with sensitive smell as you are able to smell the scent of the candle EVEN without it being lit. Smell is really strong but I do like it and will def buy again.
4,7-Apr-20,5,"The Candle I Have Been Looking For I have tried a lot of candles in my lifetime including very expensive ones by Diptyque and I have to say I think this is my favorite candle of all time-pineapple evergreen is an amazing combo and I can't believe this is the first time I have come across it. I do not like flowery candles and I tend to buy citrusy ones but sometimes they are too clean and not romantic enough. This small candle fills the first floor of my house with a delicious fragrance that definitely smells like pineapple, the evergreen aspect is much more subtle. I also bought the Wild Lemongrass and there is a floral note in there as well. I can't wait to try other fragrances. I love the simple, classic packaging and the price point is perfect for hostess gifts!"
4,24-Sep-20,5,"Meh.... First of all, I love these candles. I have my favorites....but wanted to try a different scent for ny kitchen. The Lemon biscotti sounded just right. To be honest, its scent was not as authentic as the others I've tried. It's rather run of the mill cheap smelling. Don't let that deter you from buying from this company, though."
4,10-Sep-20,5,"Smells amazing,  Pineapple Evegreen ! I ordered and received very quickly the pineapple evergreen in the smaller one wick size. As soon as I received it, I lit it and was simply amazed at The scent! The combination of pineapple & evergreen is so uplifting to the senses, and that little 6oz  candle immediately infused the air in a large room with that magnificent scent!  Most of the jar candles that I own take about 20 minutes before You actually smell the scent‚Ä¶ That was not the case with this candle it was almost instantaneous. I absolutely love it and is now one of my favorite candle brands and particularly the pineapple evergreen.  You won‚Äôt be disappointed"
4,12-Apr-19,5,"Lovely! I really didn't want to break down and buy a whole ""essential oils"" kit, but I recently experienced a Lemongrass essential oil at work.. and I just had to have more! - found this highly rated candle and thought I'd give it a shot!! Glad I did because it smells amazing, which is always iffy when buying scented things online! Happy with the price for the quality and quantity. Would buy more if there were more scents. I'll be on the lookout for future scents!Jasmine, gardenia... please? :)"
4,6-Oct-19,5,"Adorable candle So I ordered this candle as a gift, and it smelled so good that I contemplated keeping it for myself. I didn't, BUT I did send a link to my husband and told him this would make a great surprise for myself. The jasmine and apple had such a great balance and the scents blend beautifully, imo. I was a little surprised at the size of the candle (I thought it would be a little bigger). Everything about this candle is adorable and it's perfect for a gift bag for someone. I will absolutely be ordering again- for both gifts and myself!"
4,18-Apr-20,5,"Long lasting and powerful scent My biggest problem with candles is that they smell great in the jar but you can barely smell them in the air once you burn them. These candles deliver a powerful strong scent! I can't get enough. I've tried a few different scents - Fresh linen and Pineapple evergreen are my favorites. They're pretty enough to give as a gift, but I keep them for myself!"
4,15-Jun-20,5,"All the scent of  Nag Champa none of the smoke! I love Nag Champa incense but thanks to asthma I can't burn them anymore. I decided to take a chance on a candle. It smells just like the incense. My apartment smells wonderful and I'm not wheezing. It also doesn't carry as much as incense so my apartments neighbors won't complain, old house with 4 apartments so smoke travels."
4,4-Apr-20,5,"Jasmine, Oud & Sandalwood is AMAZING! Smells amazing, but also burns very slow which I like. It isn‚Äôt too intense of a smell (I got the Jasmine, Oud & Sandalwood) but it also definitely fills the room. When you leave the room and walk back in, you notice the difference and I LOVE that. That‚Äôs super important to me!"
4,7-Oct-20,3,"Wild Lemongrass > Pineapple Evergreen I've always been a fan of Lulu Candles, specifically the wild lemongrass scent. After burning through two of my lemongrass candles, I thought I would be a bit more adventurous and try another scent. The pineapple evergreen definitely intrigued me, and I was pleasantly surprised by all the positive reviews it had. You are immediately hit by the scent when you unpack the candle, and I'm not really sure if it was what I am usually a fan of. It smelled a little too strong and sweet for my taste, but definitely will still burn it and if I like it more then maybe I'll come back and edit my review. However, lulu candles is still one of my favorite, affordable brands, and their candles always look so so elegant!!"
4,20-Feb-20,5,"Smells heavenly!!! I just got 2 Lulu coffee candles in the mail to replace another brand I usually get... and wow! These actually smell a lot more like coffee! :) I‚Äôm a little scared of some of the reviews that talk about these candles exploding... but it does say on the candle not to leave it burning for more than 4 hours, so hopefully as long as I follow the safety rules it will all be ok!"
4,8-Jan-20,5,"A-Plus What should a ""Sexy Man"" candle smell like?  According to the person I bought this for, it should smell like this candle.  Bit of a tricky one, but they hit it out of the park.  Candle seems to burn nice and clean, and it's a good size, not too big and not too small.  Price was right.  All in all, I'd buy another one, if she asks me to."
4,14-Nov-20,1,"the candle is fragrant only upon opening If your idea of a ""holiday"" scent is cloves then you might be happy but the candle is not fragrant while burning. The box packaging is pretty - but the ugly white sticky warning label on the glass is unsightly and difficult to remove. I've gotten much better candles for this price- wouldn't recommend..."
4,17-May-20,5,"Smells great! I just got the jasmine-infused bergamot, and I love it! The design is clean and it fills my room well. I enjoy it a lot. The soft flickering flame brushes against my memories in a longing manner, yearning for the soothing comfort of the past yet fighting for a future that is fervently filled with a burning compassion. The jasmine scent drifts through the air, kissing my skin like a mother who lost her child while fleeing in the chaos of a dictator's regime. The faint yet passionately tender hint of bergamot flirts with the trace of jasmine infusion, foregoing my burdensome worries as it holds my hand gently and whispers sweet nothings as it carefully guides me back home."
4,13-Jun-19,5,"Love these candles! I lit this the moment I unboxed it. It was very fragrant, but not overpowering. Very nice design and has an elegant look. I bought 4 and I hope they last a long time. After three hours, it still looks brand new, so I'm sure I'll be using these for months to come."
4,26-Aug-20,5,"Pineapple Evergreen=Yummy I just placed my second order.  I live in Flagstaff so LOTS of pine trees.  I couldn't imagine this combo but it's been amazingly fresh.  My first order was a small and I just received 2 larges.  The scent, while not over powering, is strong enough for a big room.  I hate a candle I have to stand next to to guess what the scent it all about.  So far the small has had some longevity.  The candles are simply packaged ( a bonus) .  All and all a 5 star for me"
4,17-May-19,4,"No.5 - Beautiful Clean Light Scent I purchased the 6oz. No5 Soy CandlevFresh Linen. I purchased this candle because of what I thought would be it's linen smell. I opened the jar which has a seal underneath it's lid. INCREDABLY FRESH SCENT. I love this! It is so refreshing. light and smells very clean. How.did you do this? I am very pleased with product and plan to comtinue to purchase it. Lovely smell, perfect size. I am so glad I decided to give it a try!!"
4,22-May-20,2,"Doesn‚Äôt smell like ‚ÄòAmber‚Äô Super disappointed. I‚Äôm not one to usually buy a candle online without smelling it first but I figured I couldn‚Äôt go wrong with Amber scent and I can‚Äôt go out shopping with the pandemic. It smells more like baby powder which is just ... not cute. It doesn‚Äôt have much of a throw, either (which in this case is fine given I‚Äôm not fond of the smell)."
4,7-Jun-20,5,Love these candles This is my second LULU candle I‚Äôve purchased this week. I purchased the Pineapple Evergreen and now the Lemongrass. I love them both. They smell amazing!! I love the look of the label which is clean and non distracting. I am always looking for non toxic candles and found a new favorite brand. I will be purchasing clean linen next :)
4,24-Oct-20,5,"Damn that's a fancy candle I found this candle while hunting down a Le Labo Noir 29 smell-alike. Now, this doesn't smell like Noir 29 (I think that's my fault for choosing the wrong scent -- got Jasmin and maybe should have gone for black tea if I was trying to get close to Noir) but it does have the *essence* of a Le Labo scent...? Like, it just smells FANCY in the way that all Le Labo scents just smell FANCY. This is by far the nicest smelling candle I own, and I'm definitely getting more."
4,13-Mar-19,5,"Quality Candle ~ Beautiful Fragrance I like this candle because the fragrance is very subtle. There is no black marks around the rim of the candle. It burns slowly.  It makes the house smell so good!  It came in a box that is securely package, which is perfect for wrapping as gift. Most importantly, it doesn't give me a headache like other candles do! Highly recommended."
4,21-Apr-20,4,"Great throw from such a small candle! Really great throw from such a small candle. The scent is nice but not very interesting. I‚Äôd buy this brand again, though, as the quality of this candle seems very good - although it is expensive for the small size. Still - you could get a larger candle for the same price that wouldn‚Äôt have half the scent throw."
4,28-Jan-19,5,"Great Candles These candles are amazing!  I read some of the reviews and bought the 6oz of Pineapple Evergreen and Lemon Vanilla Bean.  Both smell wonderful and put off a wide range of scent.  They also appear to be long lasting as the description states - over the past week, I've lit one of them each night for 4-5 hours and the wax has only gone down a little bit.  I also love the labeling and that they come with a lid.  I will definitely be buying the other scents once these burn out.  Would highly recommend."
4,27-Dec-19,4,"Small but mighty Ordered this to try and replace another Fresh Linen scented candle we loved.  However, even though we like a candle that throws the scent so it can be smelled beyond the location of the candle itself, this candle's fragrance is just too strong for us, hence the three and four starred rating. After it is lit, we can only keep it burning for about 15 minutes at a time."
4,12-Oct-20,5,Scent is great! The 6oz. size is close to a large votive/ small jar if you were to compare it to the candles of the Yankees. My son loves the Mary Jane scent.  The wax kept putting itself out though. The Pineapple evergreen has an AMAZING smell and seems to be burning slow enough. Will update once it burns down.
4,5-Jul-20,1,"""Fresh Linen"" was overwhelmingly floral Purchased the ""fresh linen"" scent and it came off as an extremely strong floral smell. It was very overwhelming and gave both me and my spouse a headache. We threw it out. Cannot speak to the other scents in this collection,  and the overall quality of the packaging and actual candle seemed good,  but for us the smell was just very abrasive."
4,10-Oct-20,5,"Pungent Candle! I was pleasantly surprised at how much I can smell this candle! For the price, I was really hoping it was something that would actually smell good in my house. I bought the Jasmine infused Bergamot and I don't think that really describes the smell, it's a little more perfume/soapy, but it's still a pleasant smell, and I smell it immediately. You take a little gamble when you buy a candle without smelling it, but take your best guess, these candles are worth the $$."
4,25-Sep-20,5,"Clean smell, powerful little candle! Heard about this candle from a local blogger and had to give it a try. I'm a candle lover and purchased the Jasmine, Oud and Sandalwood scent. I love the natural smell - doesn't seem too flowery or overpowering. I wouldn't recommend putting it in a small room though, as the scent may be a bit too much for those prone to headaches, but great for a living room or kitchen area. I love that it is eco-friendly soy wax. I haven't been burning it long enough to review the burn time but so far so good and lots of compliments from guests. I'll be purchasing more!"
4,18-Mar-20,4,"Cozy and Clean I'm very happy to have found this brand of candle.  I've recently given up on Yankee Candle after several scentless candle purchases.  What I love most about this candle is the scent. I love the tobacco smell.  It is cut with vanilla as most tobacco candles are.  That is the least thing I like about it - vanilla.  Meh.  Otherwise, the candle can fill a room.  It also comes in a shiny gold container which some may like... I will check out other scents."
4,5-Feb-19,5,"Very nice soy candle I'm very pleased with the Pineapple Evergreen scent--it's mostly pineapple with a hint of background evergreen. I've burned it for 25 hours so far and it looks like it's burned about 1/2 way. With the lid off, I can smell it as I walk by, which I like. Very happy with my purchase and would b"
4,25-Nov-19,5,"Amazingly scented even when not lit! Have never tried these candles, but a friend recommended them-I bought 2, 1 for me and 1 for my sister-we were both amazed at the scent when the candle was just opened!  We lit them and they have a beautiful flame and beautiful scent that is similar to an aroma therapy candle.  I have an unlit one next to my chair, and it continues to give a steady hint of the flavor even when not being lit!  Delicious product!  Will be buying many for gifts!"
4,16-Apr-19,5,"Pretty modern looking candle Candle was packed carefully, & shipped quickly. It's a great looking candle & it smells up the entire living room, however I am not happy with the scent I chose. It has a strong cinnamon smell to it that I simply do not like, and did not expect, kind of smells like Cinnamon gum. Gonna try another scent."
4,2-Apr-20,5,"Strong scent! Although I was initially disappointed about the size this candle really does pack a punch! I've been doing quite a bit more cooking and I wanted to get a candle to cover up the ""cooking smell"". The fresh linen scent smells fresh and clean and while it may border a bit on the overpowering side for me, it doesn't burn my nose like the candles that use cheap fragrances. I would definitely shop Lulu's candles again!"
4,14-Jun-20,5,"Longest lasting candle I have ever used I‚Äôve been a long time customer for a brand named candle company and I‚Äôve never been as satisfied as this brand when it comes to the scent and it‚Äôs longevity, for the price.*true story* I lit one of lulu‚Äôs candles as I was cleaning my 600sq ft studio, and left to take out the trash. As I was walking towards my door from the hallway I noticed a wonder scent and thought to myself ‚Äúwow it smells wonderful‚Äù little did I know as soon as I opened my door, that wonderful scent was coming from my own apt.Longest lasting candle I have ever used, and will never purchase from any other company ever again! ‚ù§Ô?è‚ù§Ô?è"
4,8-Dec-19,5,"Will definitely buy again. Purchased Amber rose and musk - Exactly the sent I was looking for. Very feminine. Soft, sensual and earthy. I LOVE IT.No chemical smell while burning or when putting out."
4,22-Sep-19,5,This jasmine candle is perfection! Both my clients and I love these candles and I use one daily.  The scents are always great (any lemon scented one seems to be the fave of clients) and they last very long.  They burn clean and come with a great cover you can just put in when you want to put them out.  I just added this jasmine one in the photo to my collection of Lulu candles and the scent is amazing!
4,30-Apr-20,5,"Great scent but limited supply Loved both the Midnight in Paris and Pineapple Evergreen candles, but disappointed in the availability of these candles. Midnight in Paris doesn't have any availability in bigger sizes and is out over a month to be back in stock. Wish they were more readily available, I'd buy again - great, powerful scents and slow burning!"
4,18-Sep-19,5,"fresh linen smells so good! Just purchased the lulu candle in the Fresh linen scent! So glad i did. The scent is not overpowering but is very refreshing. It doesn‚Äôt burn as black in comparison to the yankee candle. Can‚Äôt speak on the actual longevity of the candle, but I‚Äôll have it lit for an hour or so 1-2x a day just about everyday and it has barely made a dent in the wax in the month or so I‚Äôve had it! The fragrance carries throughout my 1 floor apartment. I absolutely love this candle and will be purchasing more!"
4,9-Aug-20,4,Lemon & Vanilla Bean Yummie The scent is amazing purchased as giftsFor when I visit people for dinner as a thank you but realized these don‚Äôt come with lids that was my bad so if you want a lid check the other candles they come with lids other wise I like the glass it came in and the look is clean the scent is beautiful I will likelyKeep these and use myself since they don‚Äôt have lids and write An update review when I use it .
4,2-Oct-20,5,"Very happy and just as described I bought this to help with the smell of our cat and it has not disappointed. The scent is not overwhelming, it‚Äôs slow burning, and once this one is out we‚Äôll be getting another. I wasn‚Äôt sure about the price because it did seem steep for a small candle but the longevity will be worth it."
4,7-Sep-20,5,Real coffee aroma I love the aroma of coffee of this candle! It‚Äôs perfect for autumn.  It‚Äôs so real and delicious without being overwhelming.  I bought it as a gift for my daughter and she loves it.  This candle is a great  present for coffee lovers.
4,29-Sep-20,1,"Exploded jar and set fire to a nearby book! Be careful! On my second time buying this product, the candle was burning toward the end of the wick when the jar exploded and was white hot, shattering glass and soot everywhere and catching a nearby book on fire. Luckily I was nearby and acted within seconds, but if I had stepped away from the room, all of my belongings could have gone up in flames. Do not buy this product! If you already have, be extremely careful and keep a close eye on it while in use!"
4,30-Oct-19,5,"Nice lemon scent I previously reviewed this candle and only gave it 3 stars. I feel  my review was a bit premature. I love this candle! The lemon scent slowly permeates the whole house and is divine. I wanted something zingy, and I got it. Many have complimented me about the great scent. It burns evenly and slowly. I will definitely order this again."
4,6-Sep-20,4,"Lemony in a sweet way.  Fresh Linen not so fresh. Scent is very lemony, but a little sweet.  Not tart.  Have to drain off excess wax or it will extinguish itself. Rather small.Ordered Fresh Linen, but it doesn‚Äôt small like that.  VERY sweet.  I moved it about 10 feet away.  Tolerable.  So, if you like a strong scent, you‚Äôre good"
4,7-Sep-20,4,"Strong and good smell! These candle scents are strong! I can smell the scent even when they're not being burnt-- but it gives my room a nice Abercombie and Fitch type of smell, which I actually enjoy. I had expected the candle to smell more floral with Jasmine, but it had more of a masculine, musky smell in my opinion. Even though it's not the exact smell I was looking for, I still like it! It's been great to light when I'm taking a bath or watching a movie in my room, good vibes~"
4,4-Mar-20,2,"This smell is not pleasing Love this candle line. This particular smell was horrendous. Between myself, my husband and two kids, I light candles nightly. This smell was unanimously thought to be awful so bad I couldn‚Äôt keep burning it. Even if I don‚Äôt prefer a smell, I will keep the candle lit. Other candles in this like however are amazing! The quality, scent delivered etc. don‚Äôt give up on the line, just this smell."
4,3-May-20,5,"Wonderful Purchase - Elegant Scent I absolutely love this candle. For one it is soy so it‚Äôs safe to have around my pets. It‚Äôs a beautiful scent and definately wouldn‚Äôt consider it just a holiday one. Smells of Clean Crisp Linen, mixed with a bit of the Forest, just a wonderful soothing aroma! I would love to try other scents."
4,7-Jul-19,5,"Awesome I‚Äôve received so many compliments about this candle. I bought the pineapple evergreen and I‚Äôll probably buy it again.UPDATE: I've purchased this many, many more times after this first time. even gifted it to a friend. Needless to say, its become my ultimate favorite. the smell is phenomenal and easy going. Not strong and musky like some would think when they read ""evergreen"". its also not sweet. its nice and soothing."
4,17-Feb-19,4,"On trend candle that would be hard for anyone to dislike If you like minimalist decor, clean, no frills design, etc, you will enjoy the aesthetic of this candle. It's not frilly or gimmicky, but it is stylish in an understated way.The scent is light, not overpowering.I would certainly recommend this candle. My only beef with it is that it is a bit small for the price."
4,5-Aug-20,5,"Beware hot weather when shipping Love this; smells great, lasts forever, is a little smaller than the pictures lead you to believe, but that's ok because this thing burns forever (if you keep the wick trimmed). I'm only leaving a review to warn that this candle will be a gooey mess if you have it shipped during summer months. Bring it inside asap, set it upright, and give it a few taps on top to help level the goo. Do NOT take off the lid, because several hours of soy wax will come with it if you don't let it settle and re-harden first."
4,15-Jan-20,5,"SO GOOD! As a person who enjoys scents like most lavender candles, and Bath & Body Works' Mahogany Teakwood and (the discontinued) Black Sand collections, this candle absolutely hit the spot!  Super clean, pleasant, subtle but steady - almost like a great men's cologne that lingers.  I honestly did not expect this candle to smell as good as it does.  I was looking for a sensual aromatherapy scent for the bedroom and this absolutely did the trick.  Will definitely buy again - may well be my new favorite of all!"
4,7-Apr-20,5,"Smells up the whole room! This is one of my favorite scents ever!!! It makes the entire house smell like a warm cup of coffee! It also looks so simple and classic. I have now bought two of these candles. Also, makes me happy to know they are made from natural ingredients. Officially my new favorite candle brand!"
4,19-Aug-20,1,"Bad smell I was so excited to get this in the mail. I couldn‚Äôt wait to put this in my room as a relaxing aid which is much needed in my life right now. However, when I took the lid off to excite my senses I was immediately disappointed. I still gave it a shot by lighting it while I took a shower, giving it a chance to fill my room and change my mind. Nothing changed. It smelled like lemon cleaner but not the good kind. Very chemically smelling. I don‚Äôt think I can return it after being used and I don‚Äôt think anyone would want it. It was expensive so bummed I spent that money with this outcome. They did leave an offer for a free gift if u leave a review which I thought was a nice touch."
4,12-Jul-19,5,Quality Candles with Unique Scents at a Reasonable Price! These are fantastic camdles! I bought.The Pineapple/Evergreen and Mango/Cedarwood and they are both winners. Great summer scents! The woodsy notes balance out the sweetness of the fruit. Both the mango and pineapple smell real and not fake or perfumey. They burn  nicely and last a long time. I really like the packaging as well. The black apothocary-esque labels are very chic. I will be trying Wild Lemongrass next!
4,30-Oct-20,5,"Our favorite office candle I love these candles. I burn them in my office and the whole suite loves the smell. No 9 the Pineapple Evergreen is my favorite  but the Jasmine, Oud & Sandalwood is heavenly as well. They burn slow and even when burning but they also are great on the candle warmer. Wonderful gift items too."
4,23-Jul-20,4,"Smells Very Fresh! This candle has the light fresh linen scent that is perfect for summer time and the 'fresh clean' smell. I was looking for candles to fill the room for a house warming party, and this did the trick. The only reason for 4 stars is the candle is a little smaller than I expected, but still gets the job done.PS. - I am a candle OBSESSED person! I usually get the bamboo scented NEST but realized I need to cut down on $$ when buying candles :)"
4,23-Jun-20,5,"I love these candles! A bit pricey, but I'm a fan and customer going forward. Used (and smelled) No. 5 and 4.Updated 8/17Still LOVE these. I've recently used 9 (Pineapple Evergreen) and 18 (Espresso Bean). I have to say I'm totally hooked on the espresso one. It's instant coffee shop as soon as I open the top"
4,23-Nov-20,2,"Okay I googled longest lasting candle and this one came up as a contender.  I burn candles all day and this one's longevity wasn't highly impressive for the cost. I typically buy cheaper candles and they give off a stronger scent, but don't last as long. I don't mind a candle that doesn't last vs. price and smell."
4,25-Apr-20,2,"Barely any scent. The size was pretty much what I was expecting it to be, so I was happy with that. It also burned nice and slow. I gave it 2 stars though because I was not very impressed with the scent strength. The scent itself is not bad since I absolutely love ‚Äúfresh linen/cotton‚Äù scents, the scent was super weak. I got this candle based off reviews and I did see that people said these were not overpowering, which is fine by me however I couldn‚Äôt smell the candle scent at all when it was burning. Also I‚Äôm not sure if mine was supposed to come with a lid but there was no lid either."
4,9-Sep-19,5,"Unique, Fragrant, and Small but, Powerful These candles are small but, fill the room up with such a pleasant smell that can take you back to such happy memories. This one particular makes me think of the love my grandmother had for the smell of pineapple candles. The combination is unexpected but, perfect! We have bought various scents and gifted to others. Those that received them then come back and tell us how awesome the candle is! We will certainly be buying more. I am on my last one of my stockpile!"
4,30-Oct-20,4,"Best smell ever Okay, so the smell of this candle is AMAZING! My favorite scent ever. (I got tobacco spice) the only bad thing about the candle (at least in my experience) was that it burned unevenly and the wax started like pooling so it drowned the wick and it just won‚Äôt burn. I guess I could try scooping some of the wax out but I feel that sort of defeats the purpose of the candle. I definitely would get this event again though - maybe I just got a faulty one!"
4,4-Oct-20,5,"Finally!!!! The perfect candle scent and slow, clean, burn. So, yesterday, I spent, (and I‚Äôll use the word literally) hours, trying to find a candle that had great reviews for scent and burning time. I know, a little obsessive but, candles don‚Äôt come cheap anymore and it is very important part of your home.Thank goodness I found this gem! LULU...Congratulations! A slow burning, clean, candle that smells beautiful. I am not ashamed to say I walked around inhaling the aroma, before I lit the candle,  for about 10 minutes.After I finally lit the candle, it is a perfect blend of pineapple and Christmas. Subtle yet strong.Thank you!!!!! I will be back and you have a customer for life."
4,25-May-20,5,"These are perfect I got these while on deployment. It smells insanely good. I‚Äôve ordered them over and over again, gifted them to friends, my girlfriend, and my mom. The pineapple evergreen is one of my favorites, along with the lemongrass. The juniper leaf is perfect for Christmas time. And I just got the sandalwood which smells great. The 9oz candle lasts a ridiculous amount of time."
4,20-Jul-20,5,"Makes the whole room smell great! This is my second Lulu candle. These scents are soooo delicious and luxurious smelling. I love the simplicity of the design as well. Well worth the price. The Pineapple Evergreen is the right balance of natural and sweet, it‚Äôs not too perfumery. The Blueberry Cobbler is my guilty pleasure candle when I get home from work."
4,16-Aug-19,5,"Pineapple Evergreen - SO DELISH I was very hesitant buying this candle scent, but wanted something new that wasn't too perfume-y. I'm very much a lavender candle girl. This scent is amazing. I'm not done burning the candle yet, but I can tell it will get close to 40 hours. My fiance is not a big candle fan, but he loves the scent of this too. It's not too perfume-y (or ""girly"" in his words) and not overbearing at all. I can't wait to buy more!"
4,7-Jan-19,5,"Lovely Candle! I bought the Oud & Sandlewood candle, and I was going to gift it, but I couldn't!  I will have to buy another one for this person because I fell in love with this candle!!  Smells wonderful!"
4,24-Sep-20,2,"sent melted broken candle and smells nothing like lavender I didn‚Äôt mean to purchase two candles but 1 of the two candles was completely melted with residue found all over the package as well as no way to light it, look at attached. Melted candle also has black curly hair inside, gross."
4,5-Aug-20,5,"Wonderful scents! This was my first time buying this candle and I bought the pineapple evergreen and the vanilla oak. The candle seems to have a good longevity, although I only just got it so I can't speak to the longevity. Nonetheless, the scent of the vanilla oak is really nice. It's not too overpowering yet you can smell it well when lit. I also can smell the scent without it being lit, but simply open on my dresser. If you are looking for a sweet, yummy scent, the vanilla oak is a good one. I also bought the pineapple evergreen based on the reviews (because I was a skeptical by the name), and it is true what the others said. The pineapple evergreen is AMAZING!"
4,17-Mar-19,1,Hardly any scent Barely any scent unless you smell it up close.  I bought it because it said it was highly scented.  I have a small sitting area and I couldn't even smell it in the room when I came into it.  Unfortunately I had to return it so I was very disappointed.
4,12-Sep-20,5,Best candle on earth! This is the best candle on earth!I bought 2 for my daughter and her husbands anniversary coming up. I had a LuLu in the past and knew they were good. But I wanted a good coffee scented candle! I paid quite a bit through another site and thought they were bigger! I ordered this one for myself through amazon. I‚Äôve been burning it ever since! The picture shows 18 hours of burning !  Not straight and I trimmed the wick but 10 hours one day( I went out and forgot it) and 8 yesterday! They do not recommend u do this!Anyway if you need to gain weight burn this No 18 Expresso Bean it smells so delicious it makes you hungry!
4,7-Jun-20,5,Best smelling candle...EVER! I could smell this candle before I even opened the box it came in. It was love at first sniff. It's honestly my favorite candle ever. The smell fills my whole office.If you like the smell of coffee shops - you NEED this candle.I will absolutely be repurchasing!
4,25-Jun-20,3,"Did not like the scent I had such hi hopes for this scent because I liked their lemongrass one. I thought this scent would be true to name ‚Äúlinen‚Äù which should smell clean and fresh, but it just smelled like a bar of ivory soap, which has a bad smell. I will just order the lemongrass one from now on."
4,9-May-19,1,":( Don‚Äôt know if I got a bad batch or not, but this candle didn‚Äôt smell like what I expected at all. To me it smells like axe body spray and gives me a headache, even when it‚Äôs not lit. Overall I‚Äôm really disappointed with my purchase :("
4,22-May-20,5,"Nice small candle! Linen Scent is great! I bought the 6oz Fresh Linen scent - it smells great!  It seems more appropriate for a family room or bedroom.  I had intended to use it in the kitchen, but I'm going to try a different scent for there. The candle burns evenly and cleanly - I really like it.  I plan to buy more as gifts."
4,17-Aug-20,3,I love the scent but the candle came melted. The candle smells wonderful and is slow burning so it will last awhile. Unfortunately when I received my candle is was completely melted to the top of the lid and unusable in that state because the wick was completely covered in an half inch of wax. Wax was stuck to the lid of the jar. I heated the candle in pan with hot water to make the candle remelt so that all the wax fell to the bottom of glass jar again. The candle is now usable. I probably should of sent the candle back but the effort to do that would have taken more time than the few minutes it took me to remelt the candle. I am sure this probably had to do with the candle being mailed in August.
4,21-Feb-20,5,"MOST POWERFUL CANDLE ON EARTH I have bought many candles in my life but this Tobacco, Spice, & Vanilla candle is best and the strongest I‚Äôve ever tried. The smell fills the room and even smells days after you blow it out. Most other candles don‚Äôt even come close. I just wish they made this candle in a larger size. My girlfriend comes over and even she is in love with it! Try it! You won‚Äôt be disappointed."
4,9-Apr-20,2,"Expensive & Burns fast Horrible smell, I wish I could return it and get my money back for $20.00 a candle(4), however after burning for 5 hrs I‚Äôm down to half already so now not able to return. I will donate the other 3 candles I purchased to my 75 yr old neighbor. Never again! 0.5 out of 5 stars."
4,19-Aug-20,4,"Scent disappears quickly! I really love this candle. The label is very much my style and the smell was initially great, exactly like fresh linen straight from the dryer. The only downside is that after a few uses I noticed that the scent vanished and I could only smell a waxy type odor. It‚Äôs unfortunate because I still have 2/3 of the candle but the scent is not enjoyable anymore."
4,7-May-20,5,"Fantastic cute candle ! Wow! I‚Äôm impressed. I‚Äôve had trouble finding reasonably priced and delicious smelling candles for a long time. Very pleased just what i was expecting quality wise. The dimensions of it surprised me a bit. The size i ordered is a shade smaller than a typical candles size :) love it. I like the simple appearance of the candle as well.  I ordered the lily scent, which i haven‚Äôt burned yet, and a ginger grass scent. Ginger grass smells clean. A scent some may not prefer but for a clean freak like me. I really enjoy it."
4,26-Apr-20,5,Finally a candle that WORKS‚ô•Ô?è Beautiful candle with great smell. Used one in study where my sons cat had an accident. We could hardly walk in room. Completely made room smell clean and NO MORE BAD ODOR. Will buy again & again ! Finally a candle that works and I have purchased so many other Brand‚Äôs .
4,2-Feb-20,4,"Wild Lemongrass smells great The candle smells great- just got it today. Have it on right now and can tell that it will burn evenly and slow.Took a star off because i didn‚Äôt receive a lid with the candle. Having to turn off the candle and then smoke blowing out is not ideal.If all goes well, i‚Äôll continue with the brand."
4,3-Apr-20,5,Spot on Scents! I got my candle today (Cedarwood Infused Mango) and I love it!. I have never bought a candle online before so I was worried the scent wouldn't smell like it was described as. The candle smells not only like it's described but better! I kept looking at the packaging and saw it was hand poured in the USA which was also a pleasant surprised. Not sure if LuLu candles are a small company but i'm guessing so because the care in the product. Once I'm done typing this review i'm going back to pick out 2 more scents to try!
4,13-Apr-20,5,"Smell is fantastic! I read other reviews on the Pineapple Evergreen scent and was shocked to hear how nice it smelled to them.  So I gave it a try and it is really nice!  Soy candle is great too as I'm vegan.  All in all, I'm excited to see how long these last as I just got it a few days ago!"
4,24-Jul-20,5,Amazing! Smells just like it‚Äôs supposed too! Burns nice and slow Really impressed with this little candle! Smells just like it‚Äôs supposed too! Burbs nice and slow and heavy on the oils love it! Thank you!
4,20-Apr-20,5,"Amazing scent! I ordered espresso bean and black amber and I love them both! Espresso bean makes my house smell like a coffee shop! It‚Äôs a perfect morning scent. The black amber is a great musky scent, but it doesn‚Äôt fill my apartment the way espresso bean does. For the price of the candle, that is a bit disappointing. I would still order more candles from this company, though. They do last a while, but wish they lasted a bit longer for the price. Overall, great candles"
4,4-Nov-20,4,"I prefer this over Candy smelling candles ! I was afraid the glass of the candle was going to come in broken, but luckily, it came all on one piece.  I quickyl opened my order and lit the candle. After 5 mins of leaving the room, I can smell the warm scents of vanilla and the spices. The tobacco smell is not too strong, which makes it better for those who are not into a woodsy type of smell.I gave it 4 stars because the issue way the way the wax was poured into the jar, appeared uneven, when received. Otherwise, I cannot tell if it's 100 percent soy wax or not (just because my bf broke the fan switch and I cannot tell how the wax melts evenly or not."
4,14-Nov-18,5,"New fav candles! I was afraid to order a candle without smelling it but I‚Äôm so glad I did. It makes my whole apartment smell amazing. It‚Äôs a natural smell, not chemically or artificial in any way. I got lemongrass and I would get it again. Can‚Äôt wait to try new scents! Burns slow as advertised. Husband loves it too."
4,21-Jun-20,5,"10/10 would recommend The scent is pretty faint until its lit. Then it smells great, burns a long time. My husband hates candles that smell like desserts, but I dont want my house smelling like mens cologne or something ""manly"". This one is very neutral and pleasant. Smells like an expensive store"
4,17-Apr-20,5,"Nice soy candle for gift Bought one for me and one for a gift. The black box and gold jar is very nice. Smell is excellent to fill a large downstairs. The pineapple evergreen is a very sweet smell. Sadly, I don't smell anything evergreen about it. Next I'd like to try the espresso bean."
4,29-Jun-20,5,"Beautifully scented and strong! An excellent quality candle that you'll LOVE in your home Beautifully scented and strong! An excellent quality candle that you'll LOVE in your home.  We have a 3000 sq foot home and I am burning it downstairs. You can smell it upstairs too.  The Vanilla Oak is a nice, clean, warm scent.  This candle packs a punch and I recommend it."
4,4-Jun-20,5,"Yes!! I love, love, love this candle. I have a one bedroom condo, and you can smell it throughout the whole condo. Nice, light, but strong enough to smell throughout your home. Longevity seems fine. Sometimes I light it or use the jar warmer. I will definitely buy this product again."
4,6-Apr-20,2,"Not worth the $$$ First of all- slow burning my REAR END! I received this two days ago and have been burning it for about 2 hours each day and it is already 3/4 of the way down. Scent is fine, but nothing to write home about. If this was a $5 candle I would not really care, but considering the price point, size, and apparent ‚Äúlongevity‚Äù that they are advertising I simply cannot recommend. Would greatly appreciate a refund."
4,3-Jul-20,5,FANTASTIC candle! I LOVE the pineapple evergreen candle! It has such a pleasant fragrance to it and it helps me relax after a long day. I am pretty picky about candles and wanted something that will last awhile and didn't have a strong smell to it. I light it at least 3 times a week and I've had it for over a month now! I will definitely be ordering more!
4,21-May-20,5,"Still in love with these slow and strong burning candles! My second time buying from Lulu, I loved the first candle so much I got the larger size this time. I light the candle in my bedroom and can smell it all the way down the hall in my living room, yet not an overpowering scent. Will definitely buy from again. The only criticism I can say is I would like them to put a description of the scents that dont plainly say what they are. For example, what does sexy man smell like, or midnight in Paris? I'd like to try other scents out because I love this (and the free sample they sent) but dont want to get something I wont like because the description is vague."
4,27-Sep-20,5,"A wonderful addition to any room This candle burns beautifully and smells nice. I like the simple, understated label. The nag champa is strong enough to be noticed but not overpowering and not heavily perfumed. The Tobacco Spice and Vanilla smells AMAZING. I'll definitely purchase more!"
4,2-Oct-20,5,"Amazing & Relaxing Candle! This Lulu Lemongrass Candle that I ordered from my Amazon Prime is absolutely amazing!I have been searching high and low to find the perfect Candle, and this one is absolutely wonderful, smells so pleasant and refreshing, enlightening my entire Home with its peaceful and relaxing scent, has been lasting me a long time and I light it every single day and the Glass Jar that the Cadle is in is so elegant and matches my Home Decor.What a special Gift to myself and I intend to buy additional ones for my Sisters and Nieces as part of Their upcoming Christmas ?üéÑ Gifts.Thank you so very much!Kind Regards m,Katie"
4,17-Nov-19,4,"Candle smells wonderful. Read full description. No lid. Love the scent. I guess I didn‚Äôt read the description well as I would have never purchased this for a gift being that it doesn‚Äôt have a lid. I‚Äôll make do but won‚Äôt purchase again bring that there isn‚Äôt a lid. Other than that they arrived on time, look nice and smell nice. If you don‚Äôt mind your candle not having a lid this is definitely a great purchase."
4,28-Jan-20,5,"Great gift & very powerful smell I ordered this product in espresso flavor because my sister-in-law loves coffee so when I opened the box I could smell the scent. It was so powerful (in a good way) that I wanted to get one for myself. They were smaller than I would've imagined (usually I think about candles the size of Bath & Body Works candles), but this candle doesn't need it as it seems to burn for a long time without decreasing the wax levels. I would definitely buy Lulu candles again. They smell great & they last a long time."
4,4-Aug-20,5,"Love the scent I was apprehensive about purchasing this candle because some people had said the scent wasn't very strong - but that has not been my experience at all.  I love the tobacco smell.  It's not too strong, but smells great.  My daughter says she can smell it when she walks in the house even if it's not lit.  She loves it too.  I'm sure she will be getting one as a gift soon!  I will definitely purchase again.  It's a small candle, but it has lasted well."
4,2-Jun-20,5,"Subtle fragrant Scent This LULUC candle has a lovely subtle Sandalwood fragrance  which fills the living room with a warm positive feeling.  I light this candle before starting lunch and it invokes a spiritual approach for the rest of the day. This candle has a strong wick and after a few hours, it still burns with lots of energy."
4,22-Aug-20,5,"Another winner! this is the second product i bough from this company and i am not disappointed.  the sexy man smell is AMAZING!  it isnt over powering but strong. it has a light fresh sensual smell to it.  No bull, i would buy the s@#! out of this if they made it into wax melts."
4,27-May-20,5,"Great smell! Long Lasting! Clean Burn! I bought this candle because I was looking for a candle that I used to love that is no longer made. The scent is not the same, but I found a new favorite! The candle burns really clean which I am a fan of, because the last few candles I have had left black soot and the wicks stopped working well. Great packaging too- would gift well as part of a little gift set. I will say the candle is smaller than I was expecting, but because it lasts long it is totally worth it!"
4,21-Jan-20,5,"Fantastic candle at a great price Throughout my home I typically favor a more spicy, smoky, leathery, sultrier scent.  However, in my bathroom, I prefer something clean, fresh and crisp.  This Wild Lemongrass candle from Lulu Candles fits the bill perfectly.  It smells clean without being too medicinal, fresh without being too sweet, and crisp without being too citrusy.  I am on my second candle in as many weeks.  Don't be mistaken - this does not indicate a short burn time, though; quite the opposite, these candles have an impressive burn time.  It's just that I leave the candle lit daily for 7-8 hours at a time  (whether recommended or not), which means that it is done by the end of a week's time.  I will be buying more!"
4,21-May-20,5,"Fresh, clean scent I am a huge candle enthusiast and am loving this fresh, complex scent. I've only been burning it for a day so far so can't tell you how long it'll last. My only complaint is the larger candle (9 oz) did not come with a lid. The smaller size (6 oz) did come with a lid.  I ordered Wild Lemongrass, Jasmine/OUD/ Sandalwood and Cedarwood Indused Mango. My favorite is Cedarwood infused mango. I want to take a bite out of it."
4,7-Dec-19,2,"Pay attention to the reviews regarding the area in which you want this scent to cover!! Seeing this scent I thought ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs an odd combination‚Äù... but reviews convinced me to try it. The scent, (when you actually smell the candle ITSELF) is good! But burning it? Could hardly smell. Perhaps in a very small room (1/2 bath?) it might be ok. My summation:Listen to the reviews! SCENT is good but if you‚Äôre looking for something that will provide larger area scent, this is not the candle for you. Especially for the price, I was disappointed and should have paid more attention to others reviews. Don‚Äôt make the same mistake! ?üòê"
4,15-Sep-20,5,"Aesthetically pleasing and Sugared Vanilla smells SO GOOD! This is a truly fabulous product and everyone who values a wonderful-smelling room and house should buy one immediately! This candle smells ABSOLUTELY AMAZING. I received it as a gift, and even before I could see the candle, I was enchanted by the delicious scent of sugared vanilla. I am a lover of yummy and warm scents, but I am very picky about what type of vanilla I like. Needless to say, this is the right type of vanilla smell. Furthermore, the container and label are so aesthetically pleasing, it looks handcrafted. It seems like this will last a long time, too. I recommend this candle 100%!"
4,23-Apr-20,4,"Sexy Man? This is a quality candle but ‚ÄúSexy Man‚Äù is a misnomer. It has a very clean contemporary smell that is fine but I don‚Äôt find it particularly sexy or not necessarily male for that matter. However, I would still recommend it, but don‚Äôt expect it to invoke fantasies of exotic pleasures."
4,5-Aug-20,5,"Pineapple Evergreen I wanted a candle to make my WFH station a bit cozier. I got the pineapple evergreen scent due to the raving reviews, though I would have never picked that scent had it not been for the previous reviews. I am pleased to say I am glad i took the risk, as the scent is very nice. The smell is a lot more SWEET than i expected, but i don't mind since I do like sweet scents. I would not recommend this particular scent for those who don't like sweet scents. The candle burns very very evenly which is a big plus, as I absolutely hate candles that tunnel. The candle label is so so cute and I am glad I made this purchase."
4,21-Nov-20,5,"The pineapple evergreen candles smell so good!! These candles smell amazzzzing- pineapple evergreen is my absolute new favorite; it‚Äôs the only scented candle I buy, and I buy these regularly.  They burn at a reasonable pace? LOL !! not sure how to word it, but basically they don‚Äôt burn too quick, yet they don‚Äôt last super long either . For me personally, the scent and the fact that they are non-toxic makes these candles totally worth it !! ?üòä"
4,21-Feb-20,5,Great scent! The candle smells great and lasts a long time. It is a great gift or a purchase for yourself. The only problem I found was that espresso bean candle we received did not burn evenly and the wick seemed too thin. This was not a problem with the pineapple candle we ordered a few weeks before the coffee candle.
4,7-Jul-20,5,Amazing Candle This was suggested I try one of these candles. I love candles but it wasn't until I tried this brand I found a cotton wick and a great smelling soy candle. The Pineapple Evergreen is amazing and fills my large main floor of my home. I highly recommend this candle and this scent. Will be trying other scents.
4,12-May-20,5,"It smells amazing and it lasts forever Omg!!! I love this candle!!! It‚Äôs worth every single penny. I have mine for over a month, I light it on a little bit every night in our bedroom, 5 mins is enough for the whole room to smell amazing.I just ordered another one today, love it!!"
4,13-Nov-20,5,"Great Scent, Burns for HOURS I ordered the Jasmine, Oud & Sandalwood candle after smelling it in my esthetician's office. The candle is very long lasting with a lovely scent (warm yet fresh yet musty?? Also mildy masculine in the bests way) that spreads fantastically throughout my house. I wouldn't say the smell is subtle, but I love that about it!"
4,24-Jul-20,5,"Rose and Bamboo I've bought several candles from these folks, Pine/Pineapple and Rose and Bamboo.  Both of these smell great and I can't wait to try some others.  The Rose and Bamboo is very subtle but smells wonderful.  The Pine/Pineapple is a stronger scent but just as lovely.  They burn cleanly and evenly and the lid they come with makes it easy to extinguish!"
4,23-Jul-20,5,"A Must Buy Smells amazing! Our daughter was just born last week so I am currently nursing and wanted a refreshing, clean smell for the room. The passion fruit infused mango candle is probably the best smelling candle I‚Äôve ever come across. When he opened it my husband said ‚ÄúI want the house to smell like this always.‚Äù"
4,11-Jun-20,5,Love this scent! I recently purchased their Espresso Bean scented candle and it is SO good! Definitely one of my favorite scents thus far. It's not at all overwhelming and burns evenly. Looking forward to trying out their other scents.
4,30-Mar-20,2,"I would not buy these candles again I normally don't buy candles online but with social distancing in the current COVID-19 pandemic, I gave it a shot. I bought one Jasmine, Oud & Sandal Wood, and one Black Amber. The scent of the Jasmine, Oud & Sandal Wood candle is fantastic and the Black Amber is fine but too floral for my liking. Also the candles are beautifully packaged, so I wanted to love them. But they barely burn! Each of them have the teeniest tiniest flame. Such a tiny flame hardly produces ambiance, plus so much of the candle will be wasted because the flame is not substantial enough to be able to burn the width of the candle. I'm so disappointed. Especially because these are not cheap candles."
4,21-Sep-20,3,"Why no lid for a $20 candle? As is most their products, this candle smells great, burns well and looks nice. But for some reason this 9oz jar doesn't have a lid. The 6oz candles come with lids but not the 9oz jars. I like using the lid to out the candle out so that I don't get smoke all over after blowing it out. Plus its going to loose it's potency over time as it sits out with no lid. Disappointed, especially for the price of this candle."
4,1-Apr-20,5,"Such a great candle! with COVID-19 running rampant I was unable to go to my usual candle store. This candle was perfect! scent is great and not too over powering, seems to burn slow enough that it will last awhile. kind of pricey for only 9oz though, maybe the company could make it $12 or similar! I know its not that expensive to make candles, but I would def purchase again."
4,8-Aug-20,5,"Makes the whole room smell incredible! I'm a guy, and got this for my girlfriend, but I lit it to see what it was like, and honestly not only does it smell amazing (I got the lemon & vanilla bean one), it makes the whole room smell great (other candles we've had only really smell if you're sitting right next to them).  It still smells like lemon and vanilla (more lemon than vanilla, but like a warm lemon, not bitter), but it reminds me of a luxury resort near the beach.  Seems to be burning quite slowly, which is cool.  Still going to buy another one just because of how great it smells, but probably won't need to use the other one for a while."
4,17-Apr-20,5,"Fantastic Scent! I got the pineapple evergreen, and wow does it smell great.  Kind of like a summer/winter mixture that smells exactly as you'd think.  The burn seems consistent and slow, and the aesthetic of the candle itself is simple and clean.  Would recommend and will be ordering more."
4,12-Jul-20,4,"Cute Design! I really like how simple the design is yet it's still so cute. Love using the candle both for smell and for decor! I got the scent ""fresh linen."" I wish it smelled a bit stronger but it still smells good and fresh :)"
4,16-Oct-20,5,"The best! I‚Äôve ordered these candles as gifts for a while now! My mother is obsessed with candles and LULU candles are by far her favorite, specifically the fresh linen scent. We‚Äôve put them to the test against yankee brand and we always come back for more of LULU.Made in the USA is also a big plus for me. There is really nothing negative you can say about these candles or this company, they‚Äôre hands down our favorite and worth every penny. We have NEVER received a candle broken, poorly made, or that doesn‚Äôt burn right. Thankful for you all at #LULUCANDLECOLLECTION."
4,26-Jan-19,5,"Awesome candle!! This is seriously the best smelling candle I've ever bought. I got it yesterday and burned it for 3 hours and it made my house smell amazing. The pineapple is the dominant flavor but the touch of evergreen is perfect. It doesn't smell fake, just fresh and slightly fruity. After 3 hours of burning the whole top of the candle wasn't even melted so I think it's going to last a really long time. This is a great quality candle at a great price. I gave it 5 stars and I will definitely be purchasing more from here."
4,22-Jul-20,5,"Strong but good scent! Very pleased! As soon as I opened the box I could smell the candle. It's scent is strong but in a very good way. Right now, I have it opened but not lit and my brother said he could smell it when he entered the room. I even smelled it when I was asleep throughout the night. It's a very pleasant, and masculine smell. My mom also loved the scent. I am sure it'll smell just as amazing when I actually do light it. :) Definitely recommend!"
4,20-Jan-20,5,"Smells great and lasts long The Buttercream Vanilla is the second candle I have purchased from this company and I absolutely love these. They are clean burning and the smell is FANTASTIC. It's not too strong. This is a good scent, but the Espresso Bean one is even better! I purchased a second one of those as well. My 18 year old son simply LOVED the smell and said it everytime he came into the kitchen when I was burning it. You will not be disappointed. Best candles ever!"
4,30-Oct-20,5,"Finally!  A candle with strength. -Jasmine, Oud & SandalwoodThe scent is divine and it filled the entire room.  The price may seem a little high, but it's worth it for the strong and pleasant aroma the candle emotes.  The candle's fragrance power dropped a bit towards the last 1/8th of the jar.  Will definitely purchase again.  I'm dying to try the other fragrances!"
4,5-Apr-19,5,"Nice Sent at the Right Price So many candles are overpowering.  This one is just right.  Order two at a time and get more when you start using the 2nd one.  The screw on lid is nice for extinguishing the smoke plume when blown out.  If you are looking for a mild background cover sent, this is it.  I haven't traveled with it, but the screw on lid would be a plus for transportation."
4,29-Apr-20,4,"Lovely bathroom candle It isn't a very strong odor (I got the pineapple evergreen), but perfect for a ""man cave""  bathroom scent. Very clean, and you can detect the pineapple a bit more than the evergreen. I gave four stars because it isn't super strong, but it works well in small spaces (again, bathroom)."
4,7-Oct-20,4,"Recommend this candle I am satisfied with the quality of the candle. The scent is relaxing and strong. Even when I leave it without use, it still smell nicely. Mine is not really smell jasmine but more woody. I love the packaging as well, it looks luxurious. However, the candle does not go along with the lid. It does last long like the descrition. I think it is a great purchase."
4,18-Jul-20,5,"Gorgeous smell! I bought the Amber, Rose and Sheer Musk this time and the smell is glorious! It wafts through the house and lingers even after the candle is blown out. I have purchased other 'flavours' and they have all been wonderful. Not too strong. The candles last quite a while - I don't burn my too often but my last one is still going after a couple of months. Cute little container and reasonable price - perfect for a gift. Would recommend!"
4,23-Apr-20,5,"You will not be disappointed! My first experience with this candle was when my son bought the Fresh Linen scent for her for her birthday. Be said that this was absolutely her favorite by far. So after she opened it I had to do a smell test. I was blown away. I immediately added it to my ""wish list.""  During this not so amazing and very stressful quarantine I recieved an Amazon gift card. Perfect! I decided to treat myself to just a little taste of serenity. What a pleasure. I will have this on all of my wish lists from here on out. I plan to even gift a few too. I want to try other scents but I'm afraid I won't love it as much as the Fresh Linen."
4,29-Jan-19,5,"Jasmine, Oud, and Sandalwood At first, I was a little apprehensive about the cost for the 9oz candle but it was totally worth the money and I actually repurchased it. This candle is very long-lasting and smells so good. Even my fianc?© who normally doesn‚Äôt care about candles has mentioned how good these candles smell more than once. I would definitely recommend."
4,2-Nov-19,5,Super mega scented This is an awesome candle - fills the room with scent very quickly and even smells great hen it's not burning. I was a little surprised by the size as this is labeled as 6oz but is quite a bit smaller than the Votivo 6.8oz - however it is equally as good and a better value for the money so I am happy with it!
4,6-Jun-20,5,"Great Gift Item! I bought my first Lulu Candle (FURR A CAUSE Lavender Musk) as a gift for a neighbor who has a little dog named Lulu - seemed perfect!  The $3 donation to abandoned animals is also a lovely idea. Very modern and clean packaging so it looks great, and it has a strong scent too! I will be buying another one soon."
4,14-Dec-19,5,"So, so, so wonderfully scented! I purchased the Apple Cinnamon candle based on customer reviews.  And boy, were they right!  This candle smells better than any candle I have owned.  It gives off a wonderful scent that fills the room.  I cannot say enough about the candle.  So, so, so wonderfully scented!"
4,29-Apr-20,5,"Very natural smell I got this candle because my 2 yr old loves to blow it out after he uses his potty. The grocery store candle we had was too strongly scented for my husband, so we tried this brand. I like the natural smell this candle gives off, and my husband isn't afraid to lite it either!"
4,9-Aug-19,5,"Smells even better than expected! I usually buy candles for my wife but wanted a non-female non-sugar sweet scent so I looked for a scent more in tune with my beard oils and cologne so I decided to try this candle and wow, even better than expected. Even my wife found the scent good."
4,21-Apr-20,5,"Lovely scent I recently purchased an expensive candle from another vendor that did not last long. I decided to give this brand a try because the price was reasonable. I was pleasantly suprised about the longevity and nice, but not too strong,  scent.  I decided to purchase 2 additional candles.  ."
4,30-Oct-20,4,"A great candle but not very masculine I love this candle for a few reasons. It projects without melting a ton, the fragrance lasts a few hours or more and it‚Äôs a great candle for the price. I just don‚Äôt smell anything really masculine about this candle. I can smell like vanilla and some other leafy scent in there. I thought this was going to be like a fresh cologne smell."
4,24-Jan-20,4,"Would buy again! A friend stayed for a few weeks at my place while visiting home.  He had bought this candle and would frequently use it through out the day. It completely turned me onto the world of coffee scented candles.  Especially this one.  A few weeks after he had left I purchased this candle for myself, I went with 9oz, it‚Äôs small but I have to say it does last.  The price imo is high but if you use this candle for about 30mins-1 hour a day It will last well over a month and it‚Äôs scent will be just as strong as day 1.  I get compliments all the time, I have a small apt and it really does fill all of the rooms nicely."
4,6-Mar-20,5,"My fav! These are in my rotation of top candles (certain bath & body & benevolence candles are great too). The Midnight in Paris is my absolute favorite out there. I‚Äôve ordered a few other scents, but this one is just sexy. Not fruity or flowery, just a pleasant, warm, scent that pairs well with a bedroom. Not over powering."
4,26-Jan-19,2,Overpriced for what it is. Disappointed.  Much smaller than I had expected. Not particularly Inexpensive but it seemed to chincey to give as a single gift.
4,18-Aug-20,5,Smells amazing and lasting burn I searched all through amazon for reviews of the best smelling candles and landed on this brand. The reviews did not disappoint. I bought one at first to test it out and immediately came back for a second! My husband even loved the scent!
4,7-Nov-19,5,"Love This Candle! This candle is great quality and burns cleanly and slowly. The apple cinnamon smells so good (if you like cinnamon)! The scent is pretty strong if you're in the same room, which I like, and the scent travels to other areas of the house, too. I was using another brand of candle that was giving me a headache, but I've had no problem with this candle. And I love that when you buy one of these candles, you're supporting animals, too. Will be purchasing more in the future!"
4,4-May-20,5,"Highly Scented - great quality for price I am often searching for good quality candles that are actually highly scented, have a long burn life and aren't $50.  This one checks all the boxes! The scent is rich and aromatic but not artificial smelling and when I burn it - it actually diffuses scent into my space...I find a lot of candles smell great with your nose buried inside but when you burn them they really don't emit any fragrance - this one smells amazing when its burning and fills my whole living room.  I also burned it for a few hours and its hardly gone down at all.  Highly recommend and am planning on trying some of the other scents."
4,7-May-19,5,"Vanilla tempered by Tobacco This scented candle was a great purchase. I love the way it evenly and subtly distributes the fragrance across the living area of my house. I'm also really thrilled about the combination of tobacco and vanilla. I love the way the ""darker"" aroma of the tobacco tempers the sweetness of the vanilla so that the overall fragrance is not too heady. I normally prefer a subtle fragrance to something that's overpowering and this candle really does that!"
4,13-Jan-20,5,"Amazing natural smelling candles I took a break from scented candles in favor of an essential oil diffuser, but was craving the cozy look and permeating smell of a good candle. These do not disappoint! I chose the pineapple evergreen and lemongrass. So far, I've only lit the pineapple evergreen and it's amazing. Sweet and earthy at the same time, not overwhelming or ""sickly"" smelling. Within 5 minutes of lighting it, my whole downstairs smelled wonderful!"
4,27-Apr-20,5,"Great smelling soy candles I've purchased the pecan pie and the blueberry cobbler candles. Both smell AMAZING! I like that they are soy and therefore burn cleaner. Trying to move away from paraffin. The pecan pie candle didn't seem to last a very long time, but then again it was small. Still though, incredibly worth it. Will continue to purchase and can't wait to try more scents."
4,21-Oct-20,5,"Smells amazing!!! Just received my candle today and used it along with my electric candle warmer.  The scent permeated my office and smelt like I was bathing in espresso beans!  I can't speak to longevity of the scent since it is only Day 1 but it smells wonderful.  I was a little leery buying online without the candle passing the ""sniff test"" first, so I went with straight-forward scent and am extremely pleased with the candles so far.  I will definitely be buying more scents soon!"
4,17-Jun-20,5,Unique scent and burns clean The pineapple evergreen scent is so unique and an amazing combination! I probably wouldn‚Äôt have purchased this scent if it weren‚Äôt for a recommendation from someone but I‚Äôm glad I did. It‚Äôs a little candle but it has lasted quite a long time. It burns clean and would be a great gift for anyone.
4,14-Jan-20,5,"Nice, therapeutic, predominantly sandalwood scent. Nice, therapeutic scent‚Äîstrong but not overpowering or distasteful. The classic sandalwood scent is still the primary component, to my nose (and as I wanted), but it‚Äôs complemented subtly by the others. Nice sleek presentation too. When it‚Äôs not burning, you can still just barely smell it, which I think is a plus: subtly giving you the benefit without needing to be burned (and if you didn‚Äôt like that, you could put it on a plastic bag, etc etc)"
4,15-Mar-20,5,"Non-assuming appearance, but big scent This is a simple, aesthetically subtle soy candle with a scent that packs a big punch.  I‚Äôm on my second candle and due to reading a previous review, I‚Äôve ordered the ‚Äúpineapple evergreen‚Äù scent.  It‚Äôs fantastic.  It‚Äôs slow burning, so they last quite awhile.  The candle would make a nice gift, however, it comes in a non-marked little cardboard box, so you might just want to rewrap it.  I recommend it."
4,20-Aug-19,4,"Nice soft scent, good deal I'm fussy about candles and was nervous to buy online before ""smelling in person."" I found this brand on a list of ""top candle deals you can find online"" (something like that). It's a nice, soft scent with a clean, presentable glass/label. It's not the fanciest candle, but it's a nice upgrade to treat yourself!"
4,25-May-20,5,"You NEED these candles Literally my new favorite brand of candles. I love a candle where the scent fills the entire room. This does that AND the smell is amazing! I got one in the Black Amber scent and one in the Juniper. The Black Amber smells warm, sexy, and clean. The Juniper smells like Christmas, which I‚Äôm loving even though it‚Äôs May because it lifts my sprits. I 100% recommend and will be buying all of my candles from here on out!"
4,10-May-20,3,"The man you thought was sexy when you were 15. If a sexy man approached me and smelled like this, I would run away fast. The scent is a bit of a cross between sour smelling linen and some earthy scent like cedar or pine.This candle is also really tiny, which I wasn‚Äôt expecting. I probably could have been more aware when purchasing; I just didn‚Äôt expect it would be that small."
4,30-Apr-20,2,"I wanted so badly to love this candle but....... Had to come back and edit my review. I got espresso bean and had extremely high hopes for it as it smelled amazing coming out of its small box! After burning twice, both times for two hours,, I have notice two things: 1) the candles smell is VERY light once lit, I put it in my bedroom and it was almost nonexistent 2) the candle has already began to only burn down to the center so none of the outer wax is burning down. Very disappointing considering the price ?üòï. May give these candles one more chance with a different sent considering there are so many other great reviews."
4,26-Jul-20,5,Love it !!! I love it - well package - amazing I will buy more
4,20-Aug-20,3,"Fun and have enjoyed. This one was defective though I love the fragrance on this ‚Äúsexy man‚Äù candle, but I‚Äôm having trouble getting it to stay lit.I‚Äôve bought before without issue and my favorite fragrance is the lemon biscotti. I would still recommend the candle company, but I‚Äôll be returning this defective one. I wasn‚Äôt allowed to upload two videos, but the second one was evidence that the candle had gone out on its own for the second time after 38 minutes. I chose this first video because it explains the issue accurately."
4,19-Oct-20,1,"Not worth the price Unfortunately this candle is not only small but fails to deliver scent wise. I truly only smell vanilla, no sexy man to speak of. The vanilla scent is also only present when I am an inch away from the candle. If you're looking for an actual ""sexy man"" smell, I would recommend Bath and Body works' teakwood mahogany especially because they offer a high intensity option and are double the size for only a little bit more money. The only part of this candle I enjoyed is the packaging."
4,21-May-20,5,"Awesome smell very fragrant The smell was great the packaging was great! I'm just letting it sit on my counter right nowlove the fragrance everything I thought it would be!I have not had a chance to light it,it's a little smaller than I anticipated but that's my fault but really a fantastic smellso just gave it 3? Longevity because of the size of it and the price until I see how long it does last"
4,4-Oct-19,5,"This candle is amazing!!! I was looking for a candle that doesn't break the bank, long-lasting, strong (I love scents that will linger in multiple rooms at a time) and smells just like fresh coffee beans!!! This candle gives me everything I was looking for. I love candles and had this one burning for 8 hours straight....it looks like I've slightly used it.I love this candle so much I've bought another one to keep as a back-up and another scent to test out...Lulu Candles is my new go-to!!!"
4,10-Jan-20,1,"Very small and doesn‚Äôt last long Upon arrival I noticed that the candle was extremely small and just in a plain brown cardboard box without a lid on the candle. Not what I expected from the price that I paid for the candle. The scent wasn‚Äôt what I expected based on the reviews. Although I eventually got used to the scent of pineapple, I first expected something more pleasant and fresh smelling. Apparently my idea of pineapple and evergreen is better than the actual thing."
4,24-Apr-19,5,"Beautiful candle, strong scent I absolutely love the pineapple evergreen scent. Very fresh, floral, fruity, and pleasant for a bedroom or living room. Quality seems equivalent with the pricy designer brand candles. I will be purchasing again in the future!"
4,24-Jan-20,5,"LOVE IT! LOVE, LOVE, this candle, it smells great,  smells like exactly what is says, espresso.If you love the smell of coffee or a Starbucks, you will love this one, smell is strong enough tofill room without being overwhelming. Burns clean. If I could give this candle 10 stars, I would!Can't wait to try other scents!"
4,6-May-20,2,"Extremely strong scent - immediate headache Couldn‚Äôt burn this candle for more than a few minutes - the scent was extremely overpowering and immediately gave me a headache. I could smell it from the opposite side of the house within minutes. This might be desirable to some but it is not a mild, subtle, or soothing scent. Definitely a no-go around kids and pets.The only thing was bumped this from 1 to 2 stars was the minimal, attractive packaging and glass jar. If they will not accept a return this will be going straight to the trash. Bummed this was such a waste of money."
4,28-Sep-20,5,"It's like fall and hawaii mixed together?? My friend has several of these candles throughout her home. It's a cozy fall vibe with the obvious pineapple hawaii- so you get both fall and summer in one candle. I know... Didn't know that was possible either! Anyway, when I asked my friend where she found this amazing candle she said she had ordered it from Amazon! This came as a shock because the only way I have ever known to get candles is from browsing down the aisles at TJMaxx, Target or whatever boutique shop. You won't be disappointed :)"
4,7-May-20,5,"It smells awesome! At first I was reluctant to buy, because I have never bought a candle without smell try it before in the store. But now because of quarantine, we cant go out and I really wanted a new candle. I am glad I decided to buy this one. It really smells as if you were grounding coffee but like with vanilla. You should buy this candle. Also, although it is very small, I have been using it almost every day and it stills look like new, so the slow burning is totally true."
4,31-Aug-20,1,Smells like a funeral I ordered this candle off amazon because it got so many posts on TikTok. I just opened it up and it literally made me retch. It smells like a catholic funeral.. or what I imagine a crematorium smells like during Christmas. I had to quickly run it down into the basement. I don‚Äôt think I could even be friends with someone who thought this smell was enjoyable.
4,23-Sep-20,5,Slowest burning candle ever! I bought this candle on a whim because I wanted to try something new. I chose it because of the scent and the burn time was a bonus. I have been burning this tiny candle for 3 days straight and it‚Äôs barely even half way through. My husband just randomly looked at me and said ‚Äúthat is the slowest burning candle ever!‚Äù The pineapple ever green scent is amazing if you prefer a more upbeat scent.
4,6-Aug-19,5,"They deliver! I was doubtful about this scent...let alone purchasing something online that should be smelled before purchased... but, I was impressed by the reviews... And now here's mine added to the plethora of happy, satisfied customers.... Unbelievable pleasant scent - not strong - light and simple. It's true!"
4,19-Mar-20,5,"Helpful in a small apartment with a new puppy. Headline says it all: we have a new puppy, and she is becoming house trained. It's a learning process, so there are accidents, and our apartment is just shy of 800 square feet. Smells - the good and the bad - easily stick around. I got this candle to help remove the odor from periodic accidents, and it definitely does the trick. It's powerful enough that I don't feel as though I paid money for an underwhelming scent but it's pleasant and subdued enough that it doesn't make the apartment smell like a floral shop or that it's merely masquerading a bad smell."
4,2-Feb-20,5,"Great Scent! Great Price! I am quite surprised by how pleasant the scent of this candle is for the price. It's a perfect gift for any occasion and her or him. The smell is Unisex, and the design of the holder is presentable and should be on display.This candle is on my reorder list."
4,19-Apr-20,4,Subtle scent I enjoyed this candles scent and it was delivered professionally and promptly. It wasn‚Äôt the best longevity I‚Äôve had in a candle but it was enough to get the job done. Nice mild and subtle scent that‚Äôs not too overpowering. Works well as a gift.
4,11-Apr-20,5,Bakery in my room This candle is so aesthetically pleasing. It has a modern and minimal look. The candle burns so slow and it smells so amazing. The packaging smelt like my candle ! I ordered the blueberry cobbler and my room smells like a bakery.
4,31-May-20,3,Great smell...for 4 days Great scent... For 4 days! I bought this because it was rated the best on Amazon and wanted a candle for my studio. I lit it everyday for roughly 5 hours at a time and it lasted all of 4 days. Not worth it. Burns way too fast... Does smell amazing though.
4,26-Jul-20,5,"Great candles! Long lasting scent I love these candles! Scent actually lasts and scents the room. I think pineapple evergreen is my favorite right now, such an original smell! Definitely recommend. I will say they were smaller than I expected but they definitely last"
4,15-May-20,5,Amazing Candle! This candle is perfect for you or to give as a gift. The Fresh Linen has such an amazing scent and my whole downstairs smells wonderful! I highly recommend Lulucandles if you are a candle lover like me! Excellent quality made candles!
4,4-Mar-20,5,"Wonderful Scents; Packaged Carefully Soy candles ‚Äì Espresso Bean; Jasmine, Sweet Pea & Apple; Wild Lemongrass; and Vanilla Oak ‚Äì were delivered on time and in one box from Lulu Candles. The small candle (6 oz; Jasmine, Sweet Pea & Apple) included a jar cover which is a great way to ‚Äúsnuff out‚Äù the candle. Would have loved if the 9 oz. candles included a jar cover.My daughter-in-law had a Lulu Soy Jar Candle burning during our weekly pizza get-together and I loved, loved, loved the strong scent. Went home and ordered four; candles arrived without damage; love each scent."
4,3-Aug-19,5,Birthday Cake! The buttercream cupcake smells just like cake frosting.  I don't know about the burn time as I bought them for birthday gifts.  They say Happy Birthday on the box....much better than a card and not that much more expensive really these days.  I'm going to buy more of these in different 'smells'.
4,8-Jun-20,5,"Coffee Goodness This espresso bean candle is amazing. The scent is powerful and wonderful for all places in the house. I especially love to put it in the kitchen after cooking meal to rid the scent of food. When the wick was done, I put it on a candle warmer to melt the wax, later that day my husband came in the house and said do you have a candle burning somewhere that I can't find it? It smells great in here. :)  I just wish the espresso scent was available the larger size."
4,24-May-20,3,"Fresh Linen or Powdery Deodorant? I purchased the fresh linen scent and at first smell - I loved it. But after burning for a few hours it started to smell more like a powdery deodorant. I don't LOVE it... but it's not terrible. The packaging is super cute, arrived undamaged, and I love that it's made in the USA! I'll try again... but this scent just isn't for me."
4,23-Aug-20,3,"Lemongrass was weird I enjoyed the look of the candle and the burn time. What I didn't like was the scent. I purchased Lemongrass and the candle had a lemongrass smell when it was not lit, but once it was going for a while, it ended up smelling like a very sweet, heavy vanilla which I did not like at all. Not sure if I should try another scent or just assume that they all end up smelling sweet."
4,28-Jun-19,5,Burns clean. Smells beautiful The Pineapple Evergreen smells clean and citrusy. Burn clean.  There is NO black soot around the edge of the jar after burning.Im on my 3rd order. Order arrives on time and well packaged.Definitely not my last order
4,9-Jul-20,5,"Pineapple Evergreen !!!! - get that I‚Äôm new to the soy candles so I really didn‚Äôt know what scent to get I saw in the comments that the pineapple Evergreen was good , it‚Äôs sounded weird but it‚Äôs smells sooo good. If you can‚Äôt choose a scent choose that one . Will definitley purchase again"
4,15-Nov-20,4,"Highly scented I asked for highly scented, & this candle unlit scented a two floor house when opened.  Apparently the scents are layered.  For the first 2 or 3 hours I did not care for the scent, perhaps the oud but it eventually changed to jasmine & sandalwood, & has been very pleasant for hours since."
4,15-May-20,5,"Great candle! Lasts quite awhile too I bought this candle because I found it after doing a simple search for candles and it was inexpensive with great reviews. I was not disappointed! The wick burns at the perfect rate and the candle smell is really good, though not overwhelming at all! I'm definitely going to buy more of these candles because I haven't found much of a downside to them, especially since they seem to last quite a decent amount of time. Hoping my next experience is as good as this one! But glad I found them."
4,19-Jul-19,5,"Best jasmine candle so far! The best jasmine candle so far! My boyfriend is from Pakistan where the national flower is jasmine. I lit this candle about an hour before he arrived and he was in heaven as soon as he walked into the door! I didn‚Äôt know what bergamot was, but the scent is clean and light. No smoke or soot either."
4,19-Nov-19,5,"Nice gentle aroma This purchase was a shot in the dark but it worked out well. I like to have my office smell nice but not overwhelming and this candle is doing the trick. It smells really good, burns really well and I also quite like the design. This is my new candle brand for the office and for the house."
4,22-Dec-19,5,Very fragrant and long lasting! I have immensely enjoyed this fragrance. It‚Äôs more pineapple than evergreen. It brings a subtle sweet tasty aroma into a room. This is my 3rd purchase and now I cannot stop lighting multiple candles around my house. The scent truly spreads throughout and is long lasting.
4,2-Oct-20,5,"What a nice surprise!! A scented candle with a scent you can actually smell!! I bought this product with little expectation as most ""scented candles"" don't have scents that you can actually smell, unless you are right on top of the candle. This little gem was a pleasant surprise!! I lit it in a back room and the scent could be smelled up through the front of the house. A light, clean fragrance. I would definitely buy more candles from this company and purchase it as a gift. The glass jar is very pretty."
4,8-Oct-20,2,"Jasmine, Oud, and Sandalwood - the smell was so overwhelming, I had to return it I was very excited for this candle after all of the great reviews - however, I knew I was in trouble when I could smell the candle outside of its packaging. The fragrance is so strong that I had to end up returning it. It is unfortunate because I was looking forward to the candle but I feel that the scent should be toned down because I am currently hiding the candle in my closet, so I won't smell it, until I can return it to the UPS Store. The reason I am giving it two stars is that you may be a fan of strongly scented candles but it wasn't for me."
4,25-May-20,5,"Great Birthday Cake Scent! I loved this candle! I was seriously considering keeping it if I didn't have to give it as a birthday present, and I'm not a vanilla person. Shipping couldve been a day or two faster, but with COVID, I get it. Looked exactly like the picture and the person I gave it to loved it as well. I have a few more birthdays this year and I am considering buying a few more of these candles for those. I also loved that the box said happy birthday on it, it was a nice touch."
4,24-Oct-20,5,"Love this scent! I have always been a huge scented candle fans, and to be honest, I hope I have discovered Lulu earlier, as I used to spend extra on Diptyque candles. Lulu is way more affordable! And after comparing reviews for different scent options, this pineapple evergreen candle is my first purchase, and it turns out to be a great choice! This scent is balanced between sweet & woody, which is really nice! And it's not too overpowering, yet fills up my studio apartment all the way till bathroom, when I lit it on my desk. Love it so far!"
4,31-Jul-20,5,Perfect! This is a wonderful candle that smells like birthday cake. It‚Äôs perfect for the new normal due to COVID. No more blowing out candles ON the cake. Instead you have a great smelling candle you can use separately from the cake!
4,30-Jun-20,5,FABULOUS CANDLE; TOTALLY EQUIVALENT TO THE DESIGNER CANDLE AT OVER 3X PRICE I bought this candle as a birthday gift for my wife. She had loved a Jo Malone candle - also with the Oud scent - but it was super expensive. I found this candle and it had great reviews so I bought it. She is thrilled (so I win!). She has used it every morning during meditation and the scent wafts out from her room. It is very pleasant.  I noticed too that the wick does not get all gummed up with char. It seems to be lasting well. Most of all is that she is choosing it over the Jo Malone candle that someone else gave her.
4,8-Nov-20,5,"Smells like fall! This is my second purchase of a LuLu candle and I am a fan for life. I love the freshness and warmth of this fragrance. It is true without being too sweet and overpowering. I purchased Furr a Cause Apple Cinnamon. I love that they donate money from each purchase so I feel like I am doing something nice and getting to treat myself at the same time. I wouldn‚Äôt hesitate to buy another one in the future to give as a gift. These candles are long lasting, clean burning and smell great!"
4,11-Nov-20,5,"smells AMAZING So, like other customers, I was skeptical about the combination of pineapple and evergreen. But, after reading some reviews that swore this was the best smelled really good, I decided to give it a go. Candle arrived in good condition and I lit it up last night. OMG. This thing smells so so good and the scent fills up my entire 1100sq ft. apartment making it smell like Christmas...But, if Christmas were sipping a Pina Colada on the beach. I will definitely be ordering another one to keep once this one burns out completely!"
4,10-Jul-20,5,"Great Scent for a Guy's House This is my second purchase of the Jasmine, Oud and Sandal Wood candle and I'm buying it because I liked the first one so much.  It is as advertised, a luxurious scented candle and, as a bachelor who likes a scented candle that isn't overtly feminine nor absurdly masculine (see, Smell My Nuts, e.g.), it fits the bill perfectly.  Highly Recommend."
4,10-Jul-20,5,better than bath and body works This candle is amazing! I typically only buy candles from bath and body works but thought I would give this brand a try. Before I could even take the lid of I could smell how fragrant it was. I ordered the passionfruit and it smells amazing and sweet. As soon as I lit it. It filled the room with a wonderful aroma in no time. I've already ordered 6 more because I love them so much!
4,31-Jul-20,5,"Great scent, slow burn! I recently got into soy candles and I ordered 2 of these candles! Upon receiving them, they were smaller than I originally thought, but they burn so slow and smell SO good. I ordered 2 fresh linen, and the smell is not overpowering or tacky at all. And they look great with any decor because of the neutral coloring! And they keep the room scented nice even when not burning. I absolutely love them and hope to try other scents in the future. Definitely recommend!"
4,6-Aug-20,5,"Nice scent and good throw I got the pineapple eucalyptus scent after much debate between that and the linen scent which I usually buy in other candles. I agree that the pineapple eucalyptus one smells good but it does smell like Christmas/pine tree type candles I have bought in the past. Since I love Christmas, it makes me happy! Not what I expected but I still enjoy it. I will definitely try the linen scent too since the candle has a good throw especially compared to other soy candles I‚Äôve had that I couldn‚Äôt smell throughout the house"
4,9-Feb-20,4,"Warm Lightly Sweet Woodsy Vanilla Oak This candle is a moderate throw of 6 or 7/10 but it is beautifully soft, feminine and earthy.  I love it.  I just wish it was stronger and filled my room.  Right now, I am burning this near my desk but it barely reaches me and certainly does not fill the room. It does burn and  pool nicely, clean and even. Packed well for shipping and bundled in wrapping paper without a lid.I hope this review has been helpful in making it possible for deciding if this is the best option for you."
4,27-Jun-19,5,"Small but mighty candle that smells great When I opened it up I was concerned that it would be too small to have much effect in our apartment or might not last very long. Tried it out and the single candle fills our entire apartment, smells great, and seems like it will last quite a while. I can't comment much further on longevity as I've had it for a little over a week. The price was a little higher than expected when I viewed it, but I think the quality of the product totally justifies it now that I've tried it. You're definitely getting your money's worth with this one."
4,29-Sep-20,5,"Great candle The candle has a very strong, but pleasant smell right out of the box.  My windows are open, so when I burned it the first time, it was not strong.  I think that will change in the winter when the house is closed up."
4,5-Aug-20,3,"Very Intense Scent Throw The scent throw is really intense. It's too sweet on the nose and can really fill the room with it's scent...which is awesome if you love the scent. It is not my preference so I'm giving it 3 stars. In terms of it's scent throw, longevity, and overall price it's a good candle. Just not my speed!"
4,10-Aug-20,3,Smell great but came melted Ordered 2 and they both came melted and I couldn‚Äôt find the wick. Returned.Ordered 2 more and 1 came melted but I could see the wick so I just melted it fully and reset the wick to be in the middle when drying.
4,19-Jan-20,5,"What's not to LOVE This is my 3rd Lulu candle and I have not been disappointed yet. Last long and the scents are wonderful. Candles last a long time and I love the variety of scents they offer, always bold and nothing ordinary which is perfect. Price is a great value for the quality and longevity of these candles."
4,25-Oct-20,5,Great smell Small size but big smell. Great for my office so it doesn't smell like gross dude all day. I look forward to trying other scents as well. Definitely recommend the Tobacco Spice and Vanilla. That's the one I got.
4,5-Mar-20,4,"Fresh, sweet, subtle pineapple tempered with evergreen Got this candle yesterday and almost immediately lit it on the mantle. Not long before the downstairs had the sweet but subtle scent of pineapple throughout. The evergreen tempers the sweetness but doesn't overpower and by no means smells artificial like I feared. I dislike ""evergreen"" scents almost anytime I encounter them (except in nature - ha!) so I was curious about this one after reading other reviews. What a relief! It's delightful."
4,13-Jan-20,5,"I'm hooked I had recently finished my Le Labo candle and was looking for a new long lasting amazing smelling candle.  I read about this one in an online article and the price was right so I figured I would give it a try.  I have an open concept kitchen, living and dining area and this candle can be smelled everywhere.  My family loves the smell it is,  it is a lovely light smell not overly sweet or pungent. My guests come in and comment on how nice my home smells.  I just received my second candle because I can not get enough of smell, and wanted it for the master bedroom too."
4,3-Feb-20,5,"You won't regret ordering PIneapple Evergreen! Listen, I'm not a girl who loves fruity, sweet smells. I prefer musk, woodsy, masculine scents. But after reading a lot of reviews about Pineapple Evergreen, I thought ""why not?"" and ordered it. So glad I did. Yes, there is pineapple in it, no doubt, but it is beautifully balanced by the evergreen notes. It is not headache-inducing, overwhelming, but definitely perfumes a room. As I write this in the dead of winter, this candle reminds me that both Summer and Winter can live together in one appealing scent."
4,25-Jul-19,5,"Unique I tend to like Musk smells and am not really a fan of the ‚Äòtypical‚Äô vanillas or anything floral. This was a pretty unique scent, doesn‚Äôt travel far and isn‚Äôt really as big as I‚Äôd like but I really enjoy the smell a lot. Not something I‚Äôd imagine pairing together personally, but really does work!"
4,8-May-20,4,Smells great! I bought this candle as a gift and was pleased at how great the wild lemongrass scent smelled.  It comes wrapped in tissue paper and well packed.  The jar is sturdy and overall it's a nice quality candle.  I am giving 4 stars because the label on the jar is peeling up a bit at the corners and the wax around the wick in the center has a divot in it so it looks a little worse for wear especially since I am gifting it.  Overall would purchase again though!
4,23-Jul-20,4,"Smelled wonderful, but only lasted a month I may have misjudged the size of the candle and how long it would last.  I burn a candle almost every day for 30 minutes to an hour.  This candle only lasted about a month.  BUT---it smelled wonderful.  I would buy it again if it lasted longer."
4,22-Nov-20,2,"This candle smells bad. The packaging is nice, the price is good and the scent is strong. The problem is, the scent isn‚Äôt good. I can‚Äôt describe how it smells, but can tell you it‚Äôs unpleasant. I‚Äôm an aromatherapist and take scent seriously, so I thought it was just me being picky. But then my husband found the scent really unpleasant as well, and he usually isn‚Äôt bothered or affected by scent."
4,5-Jun-20,5,"Lovely candles with amazing scents! I purchased this product to find and alternative to the White Barn candles that I'm absolutely obsessed with. Very happy to say that the scent exceeds my expectations and is just as potent as White Barn candles. I can't attest to the longevity yet as I've only had it lit for about 30 mins, but I love the smell!I got the  Wild Lemongrass which is similar to the White Barn Limoncello. I would definitely suggest trying this one out if you enjoy clean, citrus fragrances."
4,15-Aug-20,5,"Best darn candle we have ever bought !!! What a perfectly lovely aroma !!!Sandalwood has always been a favorite scent of mine, and my home smells awesome !!!I plan to purchase many more Lulu candles !!!Thanks for making my day !!!"
4,24-May-19,5,"Long lasting, beautifully minimalist candles with various complex scents I bought the wild lemongrass scene as well as jasmine infused with bergamot. I love the way these candles smell and how they throw their scent in the room. Even though the scents are strong and very present, it's by no means overpowering. The scents you can purchase are varied, and they're complex in and of themselves. I love smelling the lemongrass scent because it doesn't JUST smell like lemon but there's something else which adds complexity and interest, same with the jasmine infused with beramot. A great product that I'll buy again!"
4,28-Jun-20,5,really cute and good quality!! this candle was a great gift for my friend who loves coffee! the scent was super strong even from outside the box. the outside of the candle was also really nice.
4,20-May-20,5,"Great small but powerful candle, perfect for your at-home workspace I ordered  the Furr-a-Cause Lavender candle to help brighten up the basement I am working from home out of. It arrived a day after ordering it, and has such a lovely sweet and calming scent. It isn't overpowering, but is definitely helping banish the musty smell I was dealing with before."
4,9-Nov-20,5,"Simply. WOW This candle arrive perfectly packaged. Wrapped securely. Upon opening, I was embraced with a charming, seductive scent of the sandalwood and Oud. I'm in love. Beautiful fragrance. Can't wait to light it up!"
4,9-Jul-20,5,"Will buy another one. Slow burning indeed! I like to have candles burning most of the day, and this one doesn‚Äôt diminish significantly after a few days. The smell is great, not too overpowering even while burning. Faint smell when open but not lit. Love the Jasmine and Lily and will try the Pineapple Evergreen next since it got good reviews."
4,28-Mar-20,5,"Smells amazing and the packing is cute! Love! The candle was smaller than what I imagined it would be, but when I went back to the site it does small it is a small candle, so it is true to the size listed on the site. I wish I would have paid closer attention because I would have loved this candle in a larger size. It smells just like sugared pecans and the packaging is super rustic and cute! I would recommend this product to anyone that is a candle lover, or for a cute gift idea."
4,6-Apr-20,5,"Powerful smell I love this! I ordered the blueberry crumble and think it smells AMAZING! I‚Äôve lit it twice now for about 20 minutes each, and the smell lingers for a good 2-3 hours afterwards (in my experience at least). To me, this means it‚Äôll last a long time for the size of it. Looking forward to lighting it more!"
4,27-Sep-19,3,"the blueberry cobbler is gross I'm giving 3 stars because the soy is high quality and I've had other scents from this brand that were great, but definitely not the blueberry cobbler. It smells artificial and sickly sweet, like a hard candy version that's only vaguely reminiscent of blueberry."
4,27-Dec-19,5,"The most scent per dollar! Lulu Candles have never let me down. We get them mainly for their scent choices and their room filling quality. The wick and oil do not give off fumes that leave your lungs hurting. When you blow the candle out, it does not ruin the lingering scent. These small candles pack a potent punch easily equal to other brands 32 ounce or multi-wick selections. Enjoy!"
4,13-Apr-20,5,"Aromas lovely I am absolutely in love with the smell of the pineapple evergreen candle. I bought it based off the recommendations from other reviews, and true expand my horizons on sense. This smell so good common that I want to buy other aromas."
4,23-Oct-20,5,"I'm sold! Another loyal customer. I've been trying for years to find the perfect candle, for my tastes. One with a lasting fragrance that still doesn't give me a headache. As such, I've spent lots of money to this end. Happy to say my search has ended with Lulu Candles. This is now my second purchase and certainly won't be my final. I get the Fresh Linen each time but I'm going to try the Ocean Breeze and the Jasmine, Oud, Sandalwood next. Thanks, Lulu Candles."
4,1-Oct-20,5,"Best candle I know This is the best scented candles - I know the price is a bit competitive, but that's how I know the quality is up there. Fresh linen is my favorite scent and once I light it up, the scent permeates throughout my apartment and it's especially nice to have it on at the end of the day while meditating to relieve my stress. I've been buying these candles for a little over a year now and it never disappoints. I highly recommend - you won't regret it!"
4,18-Dec-19,5,"Did I mention the smell, it was wonderful! I gave this as a gift and let me tell you that when I took it out and smelled it, I wanted to keep it for myself but I didn‚Äôt.  The person that received it loved it so much they already ordered another one. I recommend this product based on the packaging, speed of delivery, the way it looked, the cost and the smell.  I cannot give you any information about how long it lasts because it wasn‚Äôt for me, but the receiver had no complaints.  Most definitely smelled like a cupcake!"
4,4-Nov-19,5,"Candles so good I bought 2! Soy wax, beautiful scents and made in the USA - what more could you want? I have been purchasing Lulu Candles over the years and have never been disappointed. The Apple Cinnamon does a good job in a smaller room. If you cant more 'throw' try Vanilla Oak. Both are fabulous!"
4,7-Sep-20,5,"Love the smell I bought a memory foam mattress recently and it smelled up the whole room with a very bad odor.  I lighted my apple cinnamon odor eliminator Lulu candle and the room all of a sudden had the most wonderful smell.  I kept candle burning several hours a day for a couple of days and the memory foam mattress odor went completely away.  I love this smell so much I decided to order another Apple Cinnamon Lulu candle because the smell is so pleasant.  Because this is non-toxic,  soy candle and made un USA, Lulu is my choice of candles from now on.  Best ever!"
4,4-Nov-20,4,"Birthday cake smell Purchased this for a friends birthday, it smells exactly like a sprinkled birthday cake. She said that initial burn of the candle the scent was potent but after a few times times she could no longer smell it."
4,3-Oct-19,3,Nice candle. Not for gifting. I like the scent.  It came on time but... when you order the larger 9 oz you don't get the box and lid?  It does tell that in the description but seems like if you spend the extra money you should get that also. It's a birthday gift so a little disappointed.
4,18-Jan-20,5,Very soothing scent and beautiful glass This comes in an attractive frosted glass and the diameter leads me to believe that it will burn nicely. The scent (vanilla oak) even unlit is tremendous! Very soothing to me and is just as smooth and strong lit. So far this is burn slow and even and I think it will make a wonderful gift. I am sure I will get this scent again and try others as well.
4,23-May-20,5,Great buy! This was a gift for my friend‚Äôs birthday! The packing was great and the scent is AMAZING! Love it! I will definitely be buying one for myself! I love that there are so many scents and all different sizes of the different scents!!
4,11-Jun-20,4,"Lovely scent, well packaged, good zise I received this item quickly and in good condition. It can be tricky with candles in the mail on hot days, but this one fared well. The item appearance is sophisticated and sleek. I cannot speak specifically to longevity as I plan to make it available to an incoming houseguest to use. But the fragrance in the jar is really nice. I may order another for myself !"
4,1-Nov-19,5,"Overall great purchase Great smell and pretty strong for a one wick candle. Simple glass holder and white candle design. I was impressed with the lid and how it is secured with the silicone type seal. I have 3 other Lulu candles and the Amber, Rose & Sheer Musk II is my favorite. I only wish you could get some color in the candle."
4,18-Dec-19,5,"Smell was incredible and far-reaching, could have lasted a little longer Headline says it all: Smelled fantastic and could only burn it for a short amount of time as it was so strong. Even with that though, it really could have lasted a little longer for the price. Still, not out of character for a soy candle."
4,1-Oct-20,5,"Love the smell Have a hard time finding scented soy candles that actually have a lasting scent. These candles are perfect. So far, the Ocean Breeze is my favorite - fresh and clean. Burns very evenly, lasts a long time."
4,22-Oct-20,5,"Smells amazing I got the blueberry cobbler scent and it is amazing! Smells EXACTLY like the real thing, so sweet and delicious and quite comforting. The scent has wafted through my small livingroom and bedroom easily! I hope that it continues to burn like this as I use it regularly. Can't wait to purchase more!"
4,28-Jan-19,5,Awesome Candle Tried the pineapple evergreen based off reviews and was not disappointed. I got the smaller size and it still does a good job at filling up my bedroom. The smell is fantastic and I'll definitely order again.
4,13-Oct-20,5,"Very refreshing! Not all the candles on Amazon have a closing lid and not all of them last as long as this. I love this candle because the scent makes your whole house smell like it came out of the washing machine!I do feel like the candle doesn‚Äôt last too long, but it may have to do with how often I light it. I light it every morning after I get out of bed while I‚Äôm getting ready for the day. I put the candle out before I leave my house and it smells like I never even slept in my bed!"
4,7-Jun-20,5,"Great candle for home or as a gift Smells sweet on the nose, pineapple dominant, evergreen lingers. Once you light the candle, it doesn‚Äôt take long before the scent fills the room. We were surprised how it didn‚Äôt take over the entire room as the initial smell suggests. Highly recommend!"
4,7-Apr-20,5,"Smells lovely The amber rose musk candle is lovely. Not as rose smelling as I would've liked, but I'm definitely satisfied with the purchase. This smells exactly like a candle I used to buy from Henri Bendel (RIP). I can't attest to the longevity of the candle because I just received it today. It's definitely attractive though."
4,16-May-20,5,"Lovely Candle So I ordered this candle in Fresh Linen because the Bath & Body Works on April 30 still hasn't shipped and I was in desperate need of candles after burning something in the microwave / this particular line Lulu Candles has great reviews. ANYWAYS, this candle is amazing. It filled the entire master bedroom with a wonderful fresh but not overpowering scent of Fresh Linen. It lasts for hours and I've had it burning 2 nights in a row now. I plan to order more. It definitely lives up to the hype. It's right up there with my Bath & Body works candles."
4,22-Sep-20,5,"""$20 for a candle??"" Yeah, it was worth it. Really nice candle in all ways: the scent is mellow but still present, burns *very* slowly and evenly (no flickers whatsoever), and quality-looking jar. I gave four stars instead of five on giftability only because there's no lid. For my use, I don't care about this; I actually prefer the candle to be open in my room so the smell of ""fresh laundry"" covers up the smell of my actual laundry!"
4,14-Sep-20,5,Absolutely LOVE these Luly Candles! These candles have the best scents and burn clean. No heavy black smoke in the air as you find with a lot of other candles. My friend had one burning in her bathroom and I HAD TO purchase one right away! Enjoy!
4,9-Mar-20,5,Smells So Good! I am very happy with this candle and it smells great - like a mixture of lemon and vanilla cookies.  It's a new favorite!  Burns clean and I love that it's made in the USA.  Will be purchasing again in the future.
4,11-Nov-20,5,"Loving this candle!! So I actually got this candle for my book blog photos (see photo 1) because it‚Äôs a beautiul/simple candle but I ended up loving the scent! It‚Äôs strong and smells amazing. This is also my first fully soy candle and I think it‚Äôs the best thing ever. It lasts MUCH longer than my Bath & Body works candles, which I never would have expected. I plan to get more. See photo 2 for size comparison!"
4,18-Feb-20,5,"Looks Nice and Smells Awesome I bought the Wild Lemomgrass and Juniper Leaf scented candles.  I love them both.  The Lemomgrass smells amazing and it fills the whole room with the fresh scent.  I love Christmas smells all year long, so the Juniper Leaf was perfect."
4,18-Apr-20,4,"Smells nice, wish it was a little stronger This is a nice candle, smells good, seems to be lasting, but I wish it had a little stronger sent.  Maybe next time I will get a bolder scent and that would make it spread throughout the house more....."
4,14-Sep-20,5,"Smells amazing! I got the lemon vanilla bean and it smells amazing! Just received it so I can‚Äôt say anything about how long it lasts, but if that works out, I‚Äôm buying more of this brand going forward. I like the look as well."
4,31-Jan-20,5,"Sweet little soys! This is my second Lulu Soy Candle and I love both of them. They smell wonderful, but not over powering. They have a simple, smart design, making them perfect for home decor or a gift. I‚Äôll keep coming back for more Lulus!"
4,20-Oct-20,1,"Nauseating (but strong) Scent This scent is the most horrible iteration of a powdery floral candle. I lit it in my bedroom for about half and hour in the afternoon, but hated it so quickly blew it out. The scent continued to linger in my room, however, and remained so strong and nauseating that I threw up in the middle of the night and had to spend the remainder of my evening on the living room couch. Thank goodness I have other (similarly strong, but much better smelling) candles to cover up this scent."
4,4-Nov-20,5,Beautiful design for modern farmhouse home. Scent if fantastic for the holiday. Solid packaging and beautiful clean design for very modern farmhouse style home. Love the scent and burns very clean.  Husband loves strong pine scent (which this is not) so this was the perfect compromise for the holiday.  Will have to update with the review with longevity because I have only burned it a few times.  Testing this item for Christmas gifts for my family;)
4,26-Mar-20,5,"SMELLS EXPENSIVE!!! I purchased the ‚ÄúMidnight in Paris‚Äù candle and it smells SO SEXY! Literally like when a well dressed Parisian man walks by you! And you‚Äôre wearing a beret! #MOOD! Sandalwood, amber and an unexpected hint of ROSE! Very sexy, very androgynous and refreshing in that ‚ÄòParisian chic‚Äô way.And for $13, it has the POWER of a $40 candle. It fills my entire space. Great reach. Slow burning!Just filled my cart with 5 more Bc I‚Äôm officially addicted. And this is coming from a bish that buys LeLabo, Goop, Sisley, and Byredo. I‚Äôm a candle queen."
4,26-Jun-20,5,"Wonderful!!! I love this candle. I got the apple cinnamon scent, and it's exactly what I was looking for. Smells like the perfect Christmas. It burns really well too, nice and slow and the flame doesn't get very large, so it's safer to have in a household with cats. I love the container as well, I'm looking forward to repurposing it after the candle is gone, and it supports a great cause as well!! Definitely buying one of these again in the future."
4,11-Jun-20,5,"Very well made and aromatic. A must try! Absolutely love this candle. The aroma is amazing and if you want it to fill the home, it doesn't take long which makes the candle last. The candle itself is a little pricey but once you light it and smell it you realize that some things are just worth it!"
4,3-Dec-19,5,"Amazing scent and great quality! Purchased as a gift for my sister who is an avid candle fan who typically gets her candles from a retail giant. She noted that this candle seems to last forever, and that it delivers a pleasant smell that is not overpowering. The candle is a bit on the small side, but when you consider that it's a soy candle with a slow-burning time, I think it's still worth the cost. Great gift for friends or family!"
4,7-Apr-20,5,"Really is long lasting! I love candles and with COVID I did not want to go to the store so I found this best-seller on Amazon. I find major retailer candles to be a bit cheesy in design, so I loved the simple label . The reviews were great so I ordered one in a popular scent, Pineapple Evergreen. I am currently working from home and I lit this baby at 8AM , let it burn until 5PM, and it looks like it only burned 15 minutes, not nine hours. Def worth it. The scent is nice, but sweet, so if you like less sweet fragrance I would choose something else."
4,24-Nov-20,5,"Just a candle with a medium scent factor. Nothing overly special about this candle.  Its a bit small and pricey, scent is not as strong as I would like.  Will be honest, go to a store and buy candles.  I have been disappointed with purchasing them here."
4,1-Nov-19,5,"The fragrance fills the room, and is not overbearing. This jasmine, oud, and sandal wood candle scented candle is now my favorite scent!It is great at freshening up my bedroom and actually can cover my entire 1 bedroom apartment with just a 1 hour burn. I'll definitely be buying more of these. For the price, compared to other candles this is definitely worth getting."
4,23-Jun-20,5,"My Wife Approves! These are really nice candles.  I like the fact that they do not have a cover.  A cover was always a waste in my opinion.  I am using these candles to keep my office smelling nice and zen-like while I am working from home, and it is doing the trick.  Even my wife likes the smell of the candles.  I would buy these candles again.  Thanks!"
4,24-Aug-20,5,"Yummy scent Yummy yummy.  The scent is so nice, very fragrant.  U can't say how long it burns because I just got it but I suspect by how it burns it will be average length of time.  A bit spendy for size, overall good quality."
4,16-Oct-20,5,"The Lulu Candles Sugared Pecans Candle Smells Amazing I purchased the 6 oz. Sugared Pecans candle, although it can be purchased in other sizes.  I am using this candle to fragrance my living room and 1 candle works wonderfully.  My entire living room is filled with this incredible fragrance.  It smells like a mix of what sugared pecans  would smell like, along with a dab of vanilla and fresh cinnamon rolls.  It is a slow-burning candle, so the candle will last for some time.  It also arrived very quickly, from the date I ordered it.  I would recommend this candle."
4,31-Aug-20,5,"Small package, Big results This product is firstly aesthetically pleasing. The simple font on the front is elegant and perfect for home decor. The smell is a very light scent, good for those who get a headache from strong scents. It smells very natural and provides a nice ambiance to a room. I also like that it is soy so it is pet friendly. Lastly, even though the container seems small, it burns slowly and lasts a long time. I have burned mine for 5+ hours so far and its a little more than 1/3 burned. A great purchase for yourself or a great gift for a friend."
4,23-Aug-19,5,"SMELLS AND BURNS AMAZING was looking for a new go to candle company with a variety of scents and a candle that actually SMELLED LIKE SOMETHING, not these cheap candles that burn unevenly with no smell. this company doesn't let you down. The lemon biscotti smell is warm, and has hints of a sweet lemon and sugary vanilla. The blueberry honestly smelled like I was baking freshly made muffins in my house all day...makes your mouth water and after burning for a few hours and blowing it out, it barely looked like I had even burned it at all ! Lasts for sucha long time and burns perfectly evenly. Such a great company with awesome customer service! Highly recommend"
4,24-Jun-19,5,"Great long lasting candle I ordered the Wild Lemongrass Soy Jar Candle and it has been great in the kitchen when cooking, since it has a strong scent and will mask/get rid of any cooking smells. I think the Lemongrass scent is so-so, but I love how the candle lasts a long time! I will purchase again, and try another scent! Also super cute glass jar with a cute label!"
4,23-Aug-19,2,"Not buying again. It smelled nice (but not strong, I wish it was), but it disappeared quick. I just bought this in August 14th, lit it an hour a night, and it was gone last night (Aug 23rd). Did not last as long as I thought it would've. For the price and the size, I'll keep buying locally."
4,14-Nov-20,3,"Not as scent heavy as the reviews say I was not blown away by the scent.  It is a nice fragrance I will say.  The candle is very small as the other reviewers have indicated.  I don't see the value in one this size. Maybe the larger ones could provide fragrance for a full room, but I don't want to spend the money to find out."
4,5-Apr-20,3,"I‚Äôd buy again if it was on sale The scent is a little sweet but not at all overpowering.It says long lasting  and my question is, in comparison to what? It didn‚Äôt last long enough or smell awesome enough to be worth the price."
4,18-Jan-20,5,"Great scent! Pineapple evergreen sounds like a weird mix but it's light and fresh, kinda fruity and kinda herby. I've only burned it twice but it seems to have a lasting burn so far. It's not a huge throw but just right for my bedroom."
4,30-Apr-20,5,"Smells great This is my first time purchasing a coffee scented candle and I'm loving it. Smells like I  just brewed a fresh cup of coffee in the morning!It's a bit on the pricier end, but I'll treat myself to this every so often."
4,2-Feb-20,5,"Christmas Win! I got this as a gift for my mom, who for years has been looking for a candle that mimicked the smell of the laundry room & fresh laundry she so loved. No candle came close. Until this one. One wiff and she her eyes got wide. This candle hit it on the nose. I don't know how, but this candle perfectly captured my mom's favorite scent and made her Christmas. I highly recommend it if fresh laundry is a comfort smell for you. You don't even have to light it, setting it out with the lid off fills the room with a light scent of fresh laundry."
4,11-Feb-20,5,"Smells Yummy! I was unsure about buying a candle online without smelling it first, but because of the Birthday design I decided to take a chance.  No regrets!  This candle smells scrumptious and makes a great birthday gift.  My friend loved it!  Would definitely buy again."
4,19-May-20,5,"Great scent, and makes a nice gift! I like my candles and this is a well made soy candle. The fresh linen scent is clean and crisp, but not overpowering or too chemical smelling. The burn time looks like it will be great as well, and will last a while. The seller shipped quickly and my package arrived in great condition. Very happy and will consider more of this brand for candles as a gift."
4,16-Apr-20,5,Buy it! It smells amazing and will fill you with warmth. Remember when Dad took you to pick out a tree during Christmas? THIS is the smell! Brings back so many heckin good memories. I will be ordering so many more for myself and family. Thanks Lulu Candles!!!
4,31-Oct-19,5,"Great I really, really, really like this candle. The scent is great, not overpowering but you can easily smell it when you walk into the room it's burning in. The burn time is long, much longer than the candles from bath and body works, so even though these candles are on the small side, I think It will be longer lasting than many of the other candles I've bought in the past. The packaging looks great too. I'm very impressed and definitely recommend."
4,8-Mar-20,2,"Not the size I was expecting. Not a bad product not well presented for gift. The scent is good, but there is an obvious misleading information about the size. This is a tiny candle, nothing like what you see in the picture. I prefer a 9oz, also the price seems to be right, but if you compare, this little one is way more expensive."
4,22-Nov-20,5,The best smelling candles I ever had 6ounce candle My whole house smell good Oh Em Gee every candle I bought smelled so good and one candle and I got a little candle 6oz And one candle lit my whole downstairs I got three different kinds and I give 20 stars on these candles and I‚Äôm definitely going to buy the biggest ones they got next time I just want to see if they really need your whole house smell good and one little candle made my whole downstairs smell good like even when you come in from my porch you can smell it on my porch to so I‚Äôm definitely rebuying
4,9-Aug-20,5,The Best I love everything about this candle which is on my bedside table. Even when it isn‚Äôt lit I‚Äôll catch whiffs here and there. I can‚Äôt wait to try more of the scents. 101% worth it and would be a nice gift!
4,19-Nov-18,5,"Love 'em! Everyone always says Yankee candles, but came across these and love them! Very nice jar as well, sophisticated look. Amazing scents and aromas."
4,10-Dec-19,5,"Just simply fantastic! Absolutely amazing! I‚Äôll never buy another candle so long as these are available. The best fragrance, lasts comparable to yankee candle, but feels less ‚Äútoxic‚Äù! I‚Äôm telling EVERYONE! These are wonderful! (They make a beautiful gift as well!)"
4,17-Mar-19,1,Terrible smelling candle. I would give this zero stars. Absolutely awful smell. Had to throw away product. Never even lit this candle.
4,14-Apr-20,4,"Perfect springtime scent This is a perfect springtime scent. It‚Äôs light, fresh, & happy.  The jar is pretty, & perfect for a gift. For the price, I wish it was a larger size, but I knew what to expect from reading prior reviews.  It just smells so lovely you don‚Äôt want it to ever end!"
4,23-Aug-20,5,"Smells AMAZING This is WONDERFUL. The espresso scent is amazing and smells just like a coffee shop. We can‚Äôt wait to try the rest of the scents! Not an especially big size which is the only con but since they have larger sizes, if you love candles, definitely size up!"
4,7-Jul-20,5,amazing I thought this was a little pricey due to its size but when i received it WOW........the packaging is stunning and the smell is just perfect....i wish i could explain the smell....i will be buying this again....well worth the money
4,24-Jun-19,4,"Great candle, strong scent Ordered the pineapple evergreen based on all the positive reviews. The scent wasn‚Äôt bad, it just wasn‚Äôt for us. It was too candy sweet and I never really smelled the evergreen. But the candle itself was nicely made and the scent was very strong under my candle warming light. It filled a large space very quickly. I would consider a different scent from the same brand"
4,14-Jun-20,2,"Way overpriced, not as shown, funky scent ‚ÄúSmall‚Äù is really small, 3‚Äù tall by 2.75‚Äù diameter and not the mirrored jar as shown but plain glass with a brown sticker. The candle doesn‚Äôt come in the nice black ‚Äúgiftable‚Äù box shown either. The scent is more like lemon tapioca than lemongrass."
4,28-Aug-20,5,"They are very nice candles, and smell great. I got the Vanilla Oak, and the Sexy Man scented, I know sounds weird as I type that out, but they both smell great. Burned one for a few hours and it seems as if it barely moved which is a good sign. I am a fan for sure."
4,20-Nov-20,5,"HEAVENLY ‚ú®‚ú® This candle is everything you would hope it would be. Beautiful packaging (although I wish it came with a lid), it‚Äôs made with soy and no harsh chemicals which is great for all the animals in the house, the smell is PHENOMENAL! Like my living room just turned into a goddess temple somewhere in the enchant forest. I highly recommend. The is candle really does put a smile on my face and during these tough times, I think we could all use one of these moments. ‚ù§Ô?è"
4,10-Jul-20,5,"Smells amazing?ü§© I loved this candle ,it smells just like a nag champa smell.  I will order again . BUUUTTT the candle came melted. I had to put in frezzer and kinda make it useable ,thats what is on the lid. But other then that ut is an amazing candle."
4,15-Mar-20,5,My favorite candle brand on Amazon I love these candles - this is the second time purchasing the same one and won't be the last. I normally like to smell candles before I buy them but I took a chance the first time and was glad I did. I like that they're slow-burning and hand-poured. You don't have to leave it burning for a long time to get the scent in the room either.The quality is great and they're not expensive. Looking forward to trying out another one soon!
4,25-Jun-20,5,Love this lightly scented candle! Very happy with this candle.  I've tried other brands that have a lemongrass scent but they're always too strong.  This one hits the mark beautifully and also burns very clean.  Will definitely purchase again.
4,31-Aug-20,5,"Smells like a coffee shop I‚Äôve always talked about how I loved the smell of coffee and how coffee candles just never did the actual smell justice, but this has proven me wrong! It makes my home smell like a coffee shop. Espresso scent with a hint of maybe fresh pastry? I can‚Äôt comment on longevity because I have just received it, but all other aspects are 10/10. Could see myself giving these as part of a housewarming gift, and will definitely be purchasing more as fall rolls around!"
4,23-Apr-19,5,Fragrance and slow burning! I love the fragrance and the long burning aspect!!!  The jasmine infused bergamot is such a classic combination that blends so well with any decor or location!
4,15-Sep-20,5,"Great smell! Bought it as a housewarming gift for a bachelor and he and his friends absolutely loved it (I am sure the ladies will, too)! I cannot speak to the longevity of the candle but I highly recommend."
4,23-May-20,5,"great candle at a bargain price I love expensive candles but, well, they are expensive. Based on other reviews, I thought I would try out some more affordable options and this one is the winner. I love it. It burns clean and smells as good as any candle I have ever owned, including those with an extra 0 on the price tag. Really, can't overstate this. This is an amazing candle"
4,14-Apr-20,5,"amazing natural lemongrass scent I love Lulu candles and have purchased them several times. They also have good customer service. Favorite scents are lemongrass, lemon vanilla bean and pineapple evergreen. Unique and lovely."
4,23-Sep-20,5,nice scent! I love this candle.I wanted my house to smell like a cafe and this candle did exactly what I wanted.It smells like espresso with some vanilla hint to me.It smells good before I lit up and during and after it burns.It was a smaller candle than I expected cuz I didn't pay attention to size when I purchased but it will last long because the scent lasts long so I don't have to let it burn too long.I will try another scent next time.
4,25-May-20,3,Very Expensive my bed room is 15x9 and the smell fills the room. While I like the smell i can't justify this price with all the candle options currently available. I can get bigger candles from the same price. I'm a candle lover and burn a candle daily. Will buy from time to time but definitely can't be a go to for this price.
4,6-Sep-20,2,"Will not purchase again It smells great when brand new, but it burns very unevenly and only after 2 weeks I can barely detect what was already a pleasant, but a very delicate scent.  I will finish using it,but will not repurchase from this company."
4,23-Jun-20,5,"Yummy smell, even better cause! Loved this candle! Perfect level of lavender and yet not too sweet of a smell. Used this in the room where we keep the litter box to help alleviate some of the stink. It lasted about a month with near-daily use. Loved that it also supports a good animal cause!"
4,3-Apr-20,5,"Great candle Great candle. Arrived in a small box(which I appreciate, not overpacked or packed in a wasteful manner). A nice pleasant scent. Fresh fresh. Perfect to put on a countertop or to gift. Very pleasant. Will order again."
4,6-Oct-20,5,What a wonderful scent! I am a candle addict in the fall and winter months so I have tried many... brand. Very pleased with scent and look of this candle. This a a must to start the fall and holiday season.
4,27-Oct-20,5,:) gOOd a friend had it and i loved it there so I decided to get one for home. truly love the scent and recommend it to all who like lemon grass and touch of citrus. seems to burn slowly but great scent at the same time.
4,4-Oct-20,2,"Scent is Almost Nonexistent Not sure if I received a dud, but I ordered this candle based on al of the positive reviews about the scent.  Before burning a smell was almost indistinguishable, so I decided to light it to see if that made a difference.  I lit this candle for 3 hours, and while it burned slowly, there was absolutely no scent unless you were within a foot of the candle, and only then I'd say It smelled more like sunscreen than men's cologne- extremely disappointing and wouldn't recommend."
4,5-Nov-19,5,"No artificial scents, the real deal here. I bought several scents (6 jars) and put them on a tray surrounded by 100 LED string lighting.  It smells wonderful (only light one/2 at a time.  But the LED lighting keep it sparkling all the time. Very quality candles. and I used to be a candle buyer for a major retailer."
4,25-Oct-20,2,"Won‚Äôt stay lit Lovely packaging and scent, but it won‚Äôt stay lit. I‚Äôve never had an issue like this with a candle before. It‚Äôs very strange. It won‚Äôt stay lit for more than 10 minutes at a time."
4,3-Feb-20,5,"High quality & truly HIGHLY scented candle! This is, hands down, one of the best candles I have ever had the pleasure of using. So many candles claim to be highly scented, but in reality are barely noticeable. This one is the real deal. The absolutely gorgeous fragrance of this candle fills an entire room within minutes of lighting it. The perfect blend of gentle floral, a touch of spice, and the sandalwood base creates a sensual and relaxing atmosphere, and the scent lingers even after the candle is blown out. I‚Äôm already planning on ordering another one, and I can‚Äôt wait to try all of the other scents as well."
4,30-Oct-19,5,"Perfect Scent... Not what I was expecting I ordered the Vanilla Oak candle, and I must say that it smells faintly of vanilla with more of a manly cologne scent which I love! I like that it's a non-toxic soy candle with no lead in the wick. I recently learned of the importance of burning candles that do not contain paraffin (a petroleum product) or lead in the wicks. Both of these things when burned and their fumes inhaled can make us humans very sick. Soy candles also have a longer burn life than paraffin. I will be purchasing more Lulu candles in the future."
4,17-Mar-20,5,"The best candle, hands down! Lulu candles has nailed it with this incredible blend of jasmine, oud and sandalwood. The soy candle burns beautifully and evenly, and the essence permeates in a subtle and incredible way throughout the home. The scent is sophisticated, inviting, comforting and conjures up memories you may not have even realized you had! As a longtime candle lover, having tried hundreds of different brands and scents, this is now my go-to candle. You will not regret it, and will find yourself wanting to buy for family and friends!"
4,14-Sep-20,4,"Very strong This candle is SO STRONG! I actually had to put it out after 2 hours because it was so strong. I‚Äôm not mad about it, I‚Äôm impressed! It is small for the price, so idk about buying again."
4,2-Oct-20,2,"Nice smell, REALLY small This is a REALLY small candle! The scent is nice but very light (barely fills a small bedroom with fragrance). And for $15, it is a very small candle so not really a great value."
4,7-Apr-20,5,Great candle! I have been looking for a way to swap things in my home to be more organic and sustainable. When using other candles I noticed I would get headaches pretty quickly fro the scent. With this candle I have not had that happening. Instead I get exactly what I want a nice fragrance and a chance to unwind with a burning candle and great dinner. Great product I would highly recommended.
4,22-May-20,5,Smells so awesome Have yet to rate the longevity of this as I just opened it but so far I love the way it looks and the smell is awesome. I got the Passionfruit Mango one. Love it!! I will be keeping track of burn time.
4,25-Mar-20,5,"Wonderful Candle! Great scent! Love the scent! I picked the pineapple evergreen. Yes it sounds weird, but it smells really good. The candle is small and doesnt work the best in large areas, but the area it does cover, smells great! The candle burns slow too and the scent lingers."
4,2-Jan-20,4,"Good candle but scent is strong If you like a strong scented candle, this one is for you.  It was a bit too strong to my liking by the scent is good, no problem there.  Keep the burn to 2-3 hours at a time so this $15 candle lasts a few extra days."
4,12-Feb-20,5,"My new obsession! Who buys candles on the internet?? Well, sometimes dumb laziness pays off!! Because this is by far my favorite candle I have purchased in a long time, and I love buying candles. The smell is so wonderful, it's like being on vacation in Hawaii. It smells like luxury and it's my new obsession. I will definitely be ordering this candle again and again. I'm so glad I was lazy!"
4,22-Sep-19,4,"Pineapple Evergreen So far, I really enjoy this candle for the common room in my student apartment while studying with roommates. I was wondering how this scent combination might smell and you can smell both pineapple and evergreen. Apparently, pineapple + evergreen = fruit roll up! The smell is quite robust which may be an irritant to some (I myself do not like strong smellls often but do like this candle). I would be willing to try other scents as well."
4,6-Jan-20,5,"I can't get enough of the lemongrass scent!!! The lemongrass candle is the best I have found!  It burns a very long time and no waste at the bottom!  Will continue to purchase more! And, I just keep getting more because I can't find the same scent anywhere else!  Love it!"
4,8-Jun-20,4,"strong long lasting scent I would've gave this candle 4.75 stars if i could. Everything about it was great except the smell. I bought the pineapple evergreen and i expected it to smell sweet because of the pineapple but hoped the evergreen would balance it out. Pineapple smell was too overwhelming for me, but would be great for anyone who prefers sweeter scents. I was also shocked with how quick the aroma filled up the room and how long it lasted after i blew out the candle. Will definitely purchase this brand again, just a more subtle scent."
4,10-May-20,5,"Great birthday gift I wanted to buy some birthday gifts for a friend online, since our lives have been disrupted due to the recent pandemic. She loves candles and this one comes in a rich buttercream scent with nice ""happy birthday"" packaging which makes it perfect for the occasion. It arrived on time and smells great."
4,20-Apr-20,5,"Nice transition to ‚Äúclean‚Äù candles I recently decided to make the switch to ‚Äúcleaner‚Äù candles for our home.  Upon searching Amazon, I discovered this candle company.  I ordered the pineapple evergreen scent test them out.  The scent sounds like it wouldn‚Äôt be pleasing, but trust me, it‚Äôs really a case of opposites attracting! It‚Äôs a lovely mix! The candle aesthetic is simple and chic. Best of all, the ingredients are safer! Will try our other scents."
4,6-Mar-19,5,Glad I took a chance I was pretty unsure about buying a candle I couldn't smell first but the positive reviews swayed me.  I got the blueberry cobbler and holy cow does it smell delicious!  Couldn't be happier with purchase and I will definitely be trying more scents in the future.  This is my new favorite brand.
4,13-Oct-20,5,"Great scent I wanted to try the vanilla oak, but it was out of stock. I read a lot of reviews recommending this scent and it is a unique combination. Great scent to try as it's pleasant without being overpowering. It's very tasteful packaging too! I will definitely try more of these candles!"
4,23-Jun-20,5,"Fresh Linen Very clean uplifting scent.  It‚Äôs hot and sticky outside, but inside it smells clean and fresh.  If home smells clean and fresh‚Äî‚Äî it must be so!  Love that there‚Äôs a lid to cap and release the scent at will"
4,6-Apr-20,3,Pineapple scent is too sweet I bought the pineapple evergreen scent because of all the great reviews but I just don't enjoy this pineapple scent that much. It's very sweet. But it does fill up my apt (which I like!) and looks to be long-lasting despite being fairly small. I'd buy a different scent next time!
4,1-Feb-20,5,"A great scent that hugs your nose This candle is great I love the scent and has potential to improve on its scent. Within the hour of the candle being lit it will leave your place smelling beautiful, this brands Fresh Line is a more confident and greater scent version of febreeze‚Äôs candle lines.I also noticed after a deep clean or even having a different candle simultaneously lit with this brands candle really brings its scent to stand out. I will definitely look into more scents"
4,19-Jul-20,5,"Cute gift and smells great Got this for my boyfriend for his new home. I love the scent. It‚Äôs a mix of vanilla and something masculine like leather maybe? Either way, I got it for the ‚Äúsexy man‚Äù name and I‚Äôm completely happy with the item!"
4,5-May-20,5,"This candle is amazing. I received my candle and it was delivered on time and boxed so nice.  I gave it to my daughter and she loved it!  It burned so nice and clean, the scent was amazing throughout the house.  I will buy more of your candles for sure. I want one for myself in that buttercream vanilla and i don't usually like those scents.  It was amazing!  thank you."
4,21-Jul-19,5,"instant favorite purchased candle because of previous reviews  and flat out curious about the pineapple evergreen sent .  i actually could smell the scent white it was still in the box . everybody loves it , total keeper will buy other scents from this company without a doubt ."
4,22-May-20,2,"No fragrance The candle is very aesthetic and has a nice petite design. It is also quite appealing when lit, however, the scent is barely there. Upon opening the candle for the first smell, I was very skeptical. I thought I'd give it the benefit of the doubt, but it was the same when it was lit. Better buys at target or quite frankly, most other candle shops."
4,9-Jun-20,5,the perfect slow burn candle My favorite scent is the jasmine infused bergamot!  The smell is genuine floral and it smells up both my living room and dining room!  Plus I love the fact these candles burn forever.  It's only a 6 oz. but it does truly last 40 hours!  I wanted to get away from using bath and body works so i found these guys on amazon and so glad I did.  :)
4,7-Apr-20,5,"Great Value and Scent I'm glad I came across this candle company! I'd been doing research for safer-burning candles that aren't crazy expensive. Ya girl doesn't have the expendable income for a $40 candle, sorry. I've only burned it for a couple of hours so I'm not sure how long it will last, but I love the scent. It's fairly strong. I could actually smell it through the box that it came in. That's personally what I look for in a candle! One little 6oz candle has filled up my whole bedroom with a great, clean scent."
4,30-Aug-20,3,"Misleading scent I really dislike powdery scents and that‚Äôs all I‚Äôm getting from this one. (Jasmine bergamot) I think these are quality candles, and this one has really good throw for its size! But scent is obviously pretty crucial."
4,26-Jul-20,5,Buuuuuyyyyy!!!! My boyfriend bought me this candle for Christmas 2 years ago & I still frequently order it. It is the most clean and refreshing Clean Linen scent I have found and smells fresh & not artificial.
4,18-Jun-20,5,"Reminds me of my happy place... The candle arrives in a cardboard box for protection. It is exactly as pictured. It smells like the vanilla pipe tobacco my dad uses with a very mild smokey undertone. I do wish it was larger. Overall, exactly what I expected and hoped for scent wise."
4,10-Jul-20,5,Pineapple Evergreen Smells AMAZING! This candle is beautiful and smells amazing.  I love the Pineapple Evergreen Smell.  The smell is literally addicting.  I am a huge candle lover and hate it when my candle runs out too fast.  This one seems to last pretty long.  Well worth the money.  It is crazy how smells can uplift our spirits.  This one definitely does that for me.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!!!
4,22-Mar-20,2,"Lavender Musk left me sad, not worth it Upon opening, I‚Äôm kind of disappointed. I guess I didnt realize how small 6 oz was, but that‚Äôs on me. I was expecting a stronger smell from the candle since it‚Äôs almost $15, but the sent is not what I hoped for. I got Lavender Musk, hopefully other smells are more satisfying. I was hoping for a more fragrant, cologne-like kind of musky smell, but this is just a really (emphasis on really) faint smell. I personally dont think it‚Äôs worth it. I will however, say it lasts pretty well."
4,4-Jun-19,5,"Wonderful Scent The Amber Rose & Sheer Musk scent is very sweet yet earthy. I'm a huge fan of amber, so I was very pleased with the smell. After running some errands I returned to my apartment and the scent had filled the room without having even been lit. This may be because I live in a studio, but I was very surprised at how strong the scent is. I think this candle will last a long time."
4,2-Mar-20,5,"Love the scents but the package can be better 1. Absolutely love the scents - I got the lemongrass and it made my room smells so good. I'd definitely purchase it again.2. The overall package - the candle shipping in with a small ULINE box. It's well protected and packed neat. However, I preferred it came with its own branded box.... no particular reason, maybe it will give me a feel more like a gift. And it will also help me to consider it as a potential gift option."
4,18-Oct-20,5,"Great scent, great quality, good for gifting! Perfect gift! The pineapple evergreen scent isn't too sweet and the two scents balance eachother perfectly!!! Refreshing and not too fruity! Clean burning and good quality!"
4,25-Apr-20,1,"This candle burns dirty and the glass becomes black This candle burns dirty and results in the glass holder turning black with soot. We even tried trimming the wick to prevent this from happening, though that didn‚Äôt work either."
4,8-Sep-20,5,Made in USA Just received my candles today. I was so pleased to find some made in the United States. I just lit it up and it smells great will continue to use these candles and buy more. Support US!
4,13-Aug-20,4,Long lasting! This product is definitely long lasting and subtle enough to not give a headache! I just wish I had gotten a sweeter scent - clean linen and lavender musk are great though.
4,23-Nov-20,5,More Bang for your Buck!!! This candle has a very strong and long last scent. It is small but mighty and the throw is amazing. It has a very earthy scent that my husband loves. Even when it is not lit you can smell the fragrance. I will order more and for gifts as well.
4,13-May-19,5,"the candle looks very fancy, smell strange and last long I bought Pineapple Evergreen one for myself and one for my friend birthday gift. the candle warped very nice when its arrived, so it's easy to add the gift wrap on it. I like the glass bottle so much, looks very fancy and high quality.  I burned candle about and hour, then my one bedroom apt full of pineapple smell, even the bathroom and kitchen. The smell last for almost whole day. I deferentially will buy the candle again, maybe the linen or rose flavor."
4,13-Sep-20,5,Like bringing freshness inside Wonderful smell! I put the candle on a candle warmer in my bathroom and can smell it throughout the house! Much better than I expected for the money. Excited to try other scents!
4,9-Nov-20,5,"Lovely Scent, Burns Well This is our second Lulu candle, and we have a third on the way. The Jasmine, Oud and Sandlewood (as well as the Linen) is fantastic. It's a clean, gender-neutral scent that smells wonderful and can help set a calming mood. I would prefer a lid for the the 9 oz. jar, though."
4,24-Aug-20,5,"I love these candles I love this candle; it's my second purchase. The candle is strong enough that I light it in my living room and I can smell it throughout the main level of the house (rancher). I tried one other scent, but the Tobacco, Spice and Vanilla is my favorite scent. Great value for the cost."
4,30-Jun-19,5,Great product I like this candle. I am sensitive to scents if they are on for a long period of time. It‚Äôs the same for this one. I like the smell. it‚Äôs gentle but strong enough to fill the room. It might be the scent I chose but I have to blow out the candle after a few minutes because it gets too much for me. But I noticed I can catch a nice scent even walking by the candle when it‚Äôs not even lit. This is probably because it doesn‚Äôt come with a lid. But overall I like it and will try different scents next time. And the candle itself is really simple and can be gifted to any candle lover.
4,18-Aug-19,5,Love this candle! I absolutely love this candle and will be ordering more! I was concerned at first buying the midnight in Paris scent because I didn‚Äôt know what to expect. In another review someone said it smelled like old spice and it doesn‚Äôt at all! I can‚Äôt exactly pin point what the scent is but it reminds me of the scent packets called Paris you would get at Kirkland‚Äôs or a little bit like cozy nights from target but better!
4,12-Mar-20,5,Just buy it already! #noragrets Let me make it easy on you if you‚Äôre trying to find the right candle don‚Äôt even think about it just buy it! I bought the espresso candle and OMG not only does it smell good but it makes my entire home smell amazing! I don‚Äôt write reviews but this product is one of those. Last long and burns slowly. Definitely trying out their other fragrances next.Update: Obviously obsessed with this candle!
4,6-Nov-20,4,"Smells divine Love the scent, but it's pretty subtle.  However, I did order the smaller size, and maybe the larger candle has a stronger scent?  I would order it again because I love the scent so much."
4,2-Jul-20,4,"Smelling like a Starbucks As soon as I opened up the package, BAM the beautiful scent of fresh brewed espresso whacked me in the nostrils without warning. If you are looking for a strong candle that will take you to a cafe far from home, you're in luck! The only complaint is the size. a little too small for my liking, but overall, great candle. very giftable. Four stars."
4,10-May-20,5,"Bought this for the second time! This is the best smelling candle I've ever bought. It's small but lasts for a decently long burn time. It's the first candle I've bought again (I like trying new smells), so that's say something!"
4,1-Nov-20,5,"AMAZING This candle has quickly become one of my favorites. The smell is incredible without being too powerful and overwhelming. I can smell both the pineapple and evergreen separately, but they work perfectly together. I love how long it lasts too! My whole house smells great within the hour! I will definitely be purchasing again!"
4,1-Sep-20,2,"Smells like chamomile This candle does not smell like either pineapple or evergreen.  Rather, it smells like chamomile tea.  If you like that scent, order it, because it is a well-burning candle."
4,25-Mar-20,5,"nice, subtle scent and long-lasting I agree with other reviewers that this candle is smaller than I expected, but I burned it for about 6 hours the first time I lit it and the candle barely decreased. The scent is a very mild, clean scent. Not too flowery/purfumy and not fruity, which I really enjoy. Overall I think it is a great deal for the price and I will likely buy more for myself and as gifts in the future."
4,22-Jun-19,5,"High End Quality Soothing and all natural Great quality design and sheek look...I wish It came available in a 19 oz, as opposed to 9oz. This is my 9th purchase in 6 months of buying a LULU CANDLE. I wish it came with a lid or cover. Strong & soothing all natural scent. NO sutt or fumes. 5 stars out of 5."
4,30-Apr-20,2,"Scent barely there Smaller than expected but that was my own fault. I put it in a small room and while the scent when you smell the actual candle is nice, it doesnt really burn with much of the aroma. I can't really tell I lit a candle at all scent wise. The wick also went out in its own after about an hour. So...I'm not really sure about that. The jar is pretty and rustic I guess if you just want something pretty. Personally I wouldn't buy this again"
4,14-Mar-20,5,"strong candle Was looking for a pineapple candle that wasn't super sweet smelling as a gift for a friend who likes pineapple, pineapple evergreen sounded weird together but I went for it based on reviews and the scent was just what i was looking for. Scent was SUPER strong unlit, but I didn't light myself since it was a present so I cant speak to scent after lighting or longevity,  but I imagine it lasts. I got the two pack, which did not come in a gift box but candle itself is cute looking for a present."
4,3-Sep-19,5,"Great candle, totally worth the money. My daughter and I love candles, but they can get expense. Recently we had been using the Glade candles just to get the fragrance in the air, but they are gone in a day or two.The LULU Candles are AMAZING! Not only do they last significantly longer. The smells are amazing and exactly the right intensity. My husband hates candles and fragrance in our house. When I asked what he thought of the new Sexy Man candle in our room he asked, ""What candle?"" It was just subtle enough that he wasn't overwhelmed by it, and I loved that is made the room smell warm and inviting.These are my new GO-TO candles."
4,8-Nov-19,5,"good stuff! when you love the smell of fresh linens but can't just live in your laundry room and sleep on a bed draped in dryer sheets. This candle does the trick. Smells great, looks great, and not over priced like some candles!"
4,28-Aug-20,5,Unique fragrance I bought one of these candles for a birthday gift for a friend. The description sounded so different I then ordered one for myself. I've bought many candles but this one takes the cake. I have never experienced such mysterious and sensual aromas from a candle before. I will be buying more for myself and for future gifts.
4,17-Jun-20,5,"Excellent candles! I am loving this candle scent. It‚Äôs so soft and warm and fruity. Making my whole room delightful like I‚Äôm on an island getaway! I like the size and the packaging and label too. Cute. These are slow burning soy candles, very nice. I have ordered a few other kinds of this. I like the blueberry cake which I really liked the smell of. I also had the wild lemongrass and I did not care for this scent much. I would definitely recommend trying this candle brand."
4,1-Sep-20,3,Thought it was bigger Smelled good with the nose but once lit the strength of the scent was very scarce for tobacco or even the vanilla. Small and doesn't fill up a bedroom space with its scent
4,13-Oct-20,2,Dosent live up to the price I read a blog about the strongest smelling candles this brand was number 1. The blog did say that it was a bit pricey but worth the money I completely disagree. I expected for 15.00$ for such a small size that my whole house would smell amazing and I can only smell it when I put my nose right up to it. It also is not burning evenly as I expected. The packaging was nice and presents its self as a nice looking gift. But just not happy with the product
4,24-Mar-20,5,Beautifully Packaged and Smells Divine! I bought this candle for my friend's birthday.  It is beautifully packaged and smells just like buttercream icing.  I will buy many more of these as they are a nice small gift that has a big impact.
4,8-May-19,5,"Smells incredible! I'm always looking for that delicate balance between, ""wow, it smells really good in here"" to ""WHOA. Can we open a window?"" Living in a small NYC apartment, a little goes a long way, and the 6 oz. Jasmine infused bergamot scent is just the right amount of wow. It's a lovely clean, earthy, spring scent that makes me want to cozy up and hang in. It burns perfectly even, which is nice because it doesn't leave those smudgy black marks on the glass. Also, the soy wax allows for a nice, slow burn so it's cost effective. I love to burn candles, and this one just made it to the top of my favorites in quality and scent!!"
4,8-May-20,5,"Love this scent and candle!!! This is a small candle with a perfect amount of scent.  I bought the pineapple evergreen because of previous reviews here and I absolutely love it.  I was looking for candles here and was looking at Yankee candles which I've always bought before, but these came up and I read the description, the burn time, etc. and I was sold.  I bought three of these and I will be buying more today.  It is the perfect amount of scent for a small space.  I absolutely love this candle!!"
4,17-Apr-20,2,"My Husband with his super Smell sense can't smell this candle Tiny Candle for the price and even my husband can't smell it. I would cut this candle a lot of slack if it was just me... I have a lousy sense of smell, but he is the opposite and he can't smell it at all."
4,29-May-20,5,"Smells clean I purchased this as a gift for a friend who is having a baby.  I figured it would be nice for her to use to unwind.  Smells very clean and fresh, packaging was great as well.  It's smaller than I expected, but I would still buy it again."
4,2-Apr-20,5,Smells delicious! Oh my gosh!  This candle smells delicious! Yummy! I bought No. 30..Jasmine infused with Bergamot..... My home smells so good!  I can't give you a rating on longevity because I just got it this week.... but I'm loving it! It would be a wonderful gift!
4,24-Oct-20,3,"Wick doesn‚Äôt reach bottom of candle Great soy candle with nice scent. Only issue is that the wick base doesn‚Äôt sit at the bottom at the candle, so you end up with half an inch of wax left that you can use. Seems wasteful."
4,15-Dec-19,5,"Small but Mighty --Little Warrior packs a mean punch Let me put it this wayLulu Candles' Pineapple Evergreen Soy Wick Candle is pleasantly coniferous, yet refreshingly and harmoniously robust and well-natured. In a sense, this candle mingles an equatorially raised bromeliad and the polar, frost bitten aroma of the fir; intertwining mountain and valley, sun and moon, and matter and time to bring the longest lasting symphony of lightness and darkness in reconcilable, recorded time... relatively speaking.Smells good, you should buy it. Kinda like Christmas at Jimmy Buffet's House"
4,12-Jul-20,4,"Good Light scent, wish it was stronger"
4,27-Sep-19,5,"You Need This Candle! I've got to say, I was very skeptical about buying a candle without smelling it first, but the Pineapple Evergreen is to die for!! I live in Colorado, but love tropical smells, so this was the perfect marriage of scents. Not overpowering, but instead is warm and inviting, I am already planning on buying many more for Christmas gifts!"
4,28-Dec-19,5,"Beautifully Scented Soy Candle The person who was the recipient of this candle was thrilled with it. She love this scent she loved the fact that it was soy and she said she really liked the size, too. Good price, great gift."
4,8-Apr-20,5,The smell of the candle and design of the packaging are incredible I just received this candle and haven't had the chance to burn it yet. The smell is very fragrant and true to the description of black amber. The candle was well packaged and the design of the candle is very modern and simple which I like so you can place it anywhere in your home and also gift it to people and it will go with any style. Awesome value!
4,3-Jul-20,5,"Lasting scent This candle has a great long lasting scent, and I haven't burned it long but soy candles tend to last longer. I bought a couple other scents and look forward to trying them. The smaller jar has a single wick."
4,18-May-20,5,Quality Candles This is more of a general recommendation of Lulu Candles than this particular scent Their candles are distinct but not over powering. And above all the longevity and throw given the size is what we keep coming back for as well. In an over saturated market their quality makes these candles stand out.
4,8-Nov-20,5,"The Tuscan tangerine is so fragrant and amazing! I bought 3 more for other rooms! The Tuscan tangerine is AMAZING! So good, I also tried the pineapple evergreen which is nice, and one other but I forgot which one. (That was my least favorite of the 3)."
4,19-Nov-19,4,"Wonderful Scented Candle! I bought this candle a few weeks ago for my sister's birthday. It is wonderful. I love the buttercream smell, Its lasts long and fills the entire room. She was very pleased with her gift and so am I. I would definitely buy more from this company!"
4,3-Jun-20,5,Lulu - a great new gift idea! Product is beautifully packaged. Nice glass with very nice sealed lid. The scent is clean and crisp. Bought one for my daughter & one for myself. Use mine in guest bath. Great candle for the money.
4,20-Jun-20,5,Different and delicous Love the simplicity of the look of candle and the smell is fresh! Would have never thought of pineapple and evergreen but I'm a fan now! Looking forward to trying other scents.
4,31-May-20,5,Great Candle This is a great smelling candle and presents well if giving as a gift.  It has a nice sleek look.  It looks small at 9 oz. but has weight to it.  Fresh linen has a great clean scent.
4,9-Jul-20,5,"Smells great The scent is delicious - something you never know for sure when you order online.  I haven't lit it yet, so I can't speak to burn time.  It is a bit small for the price, but it's very cute and well packaged - goes perfectly in my office or my kitchen."
4,31-Aug-20,3,"I love the packaging I really like the simplicity & elegance of the black glass w/ the white lettering, very attractive on display. This scent wasn't my favorite, but I will be trying others."
4,17-Jul-20,5,"Beautiful, gorgeous candle that smells amazing! The way this candle smells feels like the embrace of a soft warm quilt on a frigid winter day when the heating is broken. I have bought around a dozen candles over the past year or so and this one is my favorite by far!!"
4,17-Sep-20,3,Good enough-ish I really love the clean scent of this candle and the container is so pleasing to the eye. I rated it the way I did because unless I‚Äôm really close to the candle I can‚Äôt really smell it? It might just be that I got a weird batch because so many other reviews said the scent was very powerful.
4,23-Jan-20,5,"Small, But So Aromatic ! I am a frequent candle consumer and not a passes without having one lit. The pineapple evergreen is wonderfully fragrant. The aromatic combination is unique and just so pleasant. I usually purchase Yankee Candles, but lately, I just wanted a change.Even though this candle is small  it is slow to burn and leaves absolutely no black soot. None!  I have burned it for at least 2 hours for approximately 1 week and it‚Äôs still pretty full. I will definitely reorder and try the other fragrances."
4,3-Nov-20,5,"Wonderful smell and long lasting! I love the combination of tobacco and vanilla, so I purchased three different candles to see which one I like best and this is it!  The smell permeates a large area, but is not invasive.  It also lasts a long time as it doesn't need to burn long to get that great smell."
4,6-Nov-19,3,"Not all that... I purchased the Fresh Linen scent. It does smell delicious, but my problem is that you can only smell it if you get maybe 3 within the candle. The candle is very small and does not do a very good job at making the whole house smell, or at least the living room. I have purchased $8 candles from my grocery store that smell better and are bigger. Not terrible but will not buy again, not worth $20."
4,31-Jul-19,5,Scent is great ! The Wild Lemongrass scent is refreshing without smelling artificial.  I am unusually particular about candle scents and I really like this brand and this scent. I predict I will buy it again. Packing and shipping were excellent.
4,27-Aug-19,4,"Crowd-pleasing scents that can transform a room I tried both this candle and the no. 5 Fresh Linen candle. Both are solid soy candles that always make a room more pleasant to be in. They also do a decent job of masking odors. Some scents, like no. 5, are more subtle than others. This jasmine-bergamot creation is more up-front. I can now say that I play DOOM with scented candles in the background. Don't judge me.Overall would recommend!"
4,23-Sep-20,5,"AWESOME! This candle sent fills the whole house.  The sent is wonderful.  If you like sandlewood &/or jasmine, you will love this candle.  The scent is also relaxing!"
4,9-Jul-20,5,"Great smelling candle that burns clean I sent this candle to my mom for her birthday and she LOVES it! The scent is wonderful and not over-powering. Because it is a soy candle, it burns clean and lasts a long time. And the price point was very reasonable for a candle of this type. Thanks for a great birthday gift and for making my mom happy!"
4,8-May-20,5,"Small but strong scent Just received my product today and I will say it smells amazing. I got the lemon & vanilla bean scent. It is much smaller then I expected, as you can see from the photo I would consider calling this a ‚Äúmini‚Äù candle. However, because the scent is so strong and quality of ingredients this candle company claims they use, I can say I would buy it again. The glass jar was packaged well so I did not have any damage upon arrival."
4,16-Oct-20,5,"Wonderful Fragrance! I was looking for very large candles to burn during my children‚Äôs online learning. These were smaller than I wanted, but I took a chance. I‚Äôm so happy I did. The lemon vanilla fragrance is so pleasant and emanates throughout the front of the house. I couldn‚Äôt ask for more. We all love it."
4,20-Apr-20,5,"Buy it! Smaller than I thought , but it burns slow. Super worth it to me. Smells like fresh linens, clean and not super perfumie. Love it and the style they chose to hold the candle wax in. I will probably re use the jar when it's all gone."
4,30-Mar-20,3,Such a small flame I‚Äôm obsessed with these candle scents! However I am really disappointed in the wick (of my crumb cake candle). It lights up at first then immediately disappears to the short almost blue flame. There is definitely something wrong with the wick... as my pineapple evergreen one doesn‚Äôt do this.For a candle that is so small and 15$..I expected It to be made better. With such a small flame the scent isn‚Äôt nearly as powerful and doesn‚Äôt give off the same vibe that I love!
4,31-Mar-20,5,"Not too pungent, not too faint, smells just right I got the Pineapple Evergreen candle, and boy am I proud of it. Usually I like a pine candle in my bedroom for a familiar, manly scent... but the pineapple adds a little more fun. And somehow those smells work great together. I also really like the appearance of the candle. When it's lit, the whole thing glows warmly, almost like a salt lamp. It doesn't burn too quickly either, which is such a relief because otherwise I'd be spending way too much money buying this same candle again and again."
4,9-Nov-20,4,"Small candle, big scent! Wanted to try out some soy candles and decided to give Lulu candles a try.  I bought a 6 oz jar and was initially disappointed with the size for the price...  But that 6oz candle packs quite a punch as far as scent!  I accidentally left it burning longer than I intended and the scent was still around 48 hours later!  I tried another soy candle brand that was less expensive and so far the scent has been pretty disappointing.  I'm very satisfied with my lulu candle.  A great gift!"
4,20-Aug-20,5,"Pineapple Evergreen is a great fragrance for the home I loved the Wild Lemongrass fragrance, but wanted to try something different, so checked out reviews and picked Pineapple Evergreen.  Glad I did.  I love that these are white candles and soy burns forever, it seems.  Also, this being Texas, it was not melted when I received it.  (Yes, this happened to the other candle I ordered at the same time as my Wild Lemongrass)"
4,2-Aug-20,5,"Packaging for shipment Grade F- Candle in silver jar with decorative box was shipped in an oversized plastic bag without padding or additional protective wrappingPackage arrived with jar in shards, candle smashed, and deco box collapsed!! Hardly gift ready as intended. Smell from wreckage was delicious.  It has been returned.  Will not order breakable items through Amazon again!! Huge disappointment!!  No stars should be given for longevity or giftable but necessary to submit"
4,11-Feb-19,4,"Pineapple Evergreen is very fruity! I ordered the pineapple evergreen, hoping it would be more evergreen, but I feel the pineapple is overwhelming. It still smells very nice; definitely pineapple and strong. Slow burning!"
4,1-Nov-20,5,Perfect candle This candle is perfect. Was eating recently outside at a restaurant (actually the first time in 9 months...) and this was in the bathroom. Took a picture of it and ordered it the next day. So far the candle is not over bearing and adds just the right amount of scent to my kitchen and living room area. The candle scent is very natural smelling unlike some others brands out there. Will definitely be ordering again soon.
4,9-Nov-20,3,"wick kept unraveling while burning, the wick would unravel, i.e., there became two wicks.  This would cause smoking.  Blow out the candle, wait for candle to harden, cut wick, START AGAIN.Also, no lid.Not much of a scent.Won't buy again"
4,5-Nov-20,5,"Dreamy! The scent of this candle is really wonderful. This is the 3rd one I have purchased, seems a bit high priced for the size but the scent is just rather addictive."
4,4-Sep-20,5,I will be buying more This is the best candle ever. Literally smells like a coffee shop and is so strong. The smell carries through the whole house. Seems like it will last very long. I think I will be buying this candle again. Will be a staple in my collection
4,16-Jun-19,5,"Does pineapple evergreen sound weird? You bet. Is it now my favorite scent? Absolutely I was hesitant about some of the reviews on here claiming that pineapple evergreen was a great candle, but I figured what the heck, it's like $10 right? So I got this candle and it somehow perfectly nails the evergreen scent while the pineapple provides that extra *something* that really makes it pop. 10/10 will buy more eventually"
4,5-Aug-20,5,"Delightful The vanilla oak candle smells amazing. It‚Äôs not too strong or overwhelming, but does fill the air throughout our two-bedroom condo. It‚Äôs a very warm/welcoming/comfort scent. I wanted a long lasting candle and was intrigued that this one stated it burns for more than 40 hours. I was a little hesitant, but after burning it for over 8 hours on the first burning, it‚Äôs only about 1/8 down from the top so I do believe it‚Äôll last for quite awhile. I‚Äôll definitely get another and try other scents!"
4,19-Jul-20,5,"Perfect candle for them perfect Vibez Right off the rip, my Lulu soy candle smelled amazing! I ordered the Pineapple Evergreen scent which was highly recommended by fellow reviewers. Instantly no regrets! As soon as I removed the box and paper wrappings from the candle, the scent was so refreshing and changed up my room's vibe. It's as if I was driving to North Shore on Oahu passing Dole plantation smelling all the fresh pineapples paired perfectly with the evergreen scent. Already thinking bout my next purchase from Lulu candles."
4,26-Apr-20,5,Nice arima Smells great...fills up the room with a light scent....not to heavy...Great for the bedroom..living room ...dorm room...actually anywhere....Great gift!
4,25-Mar-20,5,Great Packaging! Completely intact when it arrived! I've ordered several candles off of amazon from different brands and this packaging was by far the best in ensuring that the candle would arrive to me in one piece and without any damage!
4,16-Aug-20,5,IN LOVE I LOVE this fresh linen scent. It‚Äôs absolutely my favorite. This candle has the right amount of scent without being too strong. The packaging is good and the little candle jar it comes in is so cute. Definitely will be buying more scents!!
4,10-Jul-20,5,"This candle smells SO good I love this candle because it's so hard to find pretty candles that smell good and that are powerful enough. This candle is pretty and doesn't have those tacky labels that other candles have. It's strong enough to fill my entire downstairs, and the smell (I ordered lemon biscotti) is incredible. I have not had it for a really long time, so the only negative I've seen so far (and this could change) is that it burns pretty quickly--however, it is honestly worth it and I will be buying more."
4,26-Jun-20,5,Wife ordered. Not offensive My wife has a tendency to buy scents that drive me out of the room. This one was actually pleasant despite being strongly fragrant.  It reminded me of a spa and warm winter holidays at the same time.
4,13-Oct-20,5,"Smells Great and For a Good Cause I love the scent of this candle for fall! It's a little smaller than I expected for the price, but I'm OK with it since they donate a portion of the purchase price to abandoned animals. Can't wait to order some other scents!"
4,31-Aug-20,4,"Sweet yet clean smell The only reason I‚Äôm giving this 4 stars and not five is because I was expecting it to be a tiny more earthy and a little less sweet. I wanted to smell all little bit more of the evergreen but it still smells really good. It‚Äôs one of those scents that if you light it enough, it becomes a part of your room‚Äôs natural scent and love that. It‚Äôs not overwhelming though, it‚Äôs just pleasant and doesn‚Äôt give you a headache."
4,28-Aug-20,5,"Burns clean, smells nice, good value! Title says it all. Soy candles burn cleaner (less soot), last longer, and this one smells nice - not overpowering, just a nice subtle scent. Good value."
4,21-Aug-19,3,Very small candle. I got the lemongrass scented candle. It smells wonderful. The only thing I dislike is how tiny it is. It is probably the smallest candle I‚Äôve ever bought. I could have bought a way bigger one at the grocery store for $5 less. It will make a small space smell wonderful. Did not work for a living room space.
4,14-Aug-20,5,"No regrets! I normally prefer smelling the scent of a candle before I commit to a purchase however, with quarantine I haven‚Äôt gone out much. I‚Äôm very satisfied with ‚ÄúBlack Amber‚Äù and feel confident now that I‚Äôll buy more scents from this brand! It makes the whole room smell amazing."
4,14-Nov-20,5,"NOT just for men Our actual only complaint is the name of it, cause we are gay so there are no men allowed in our house, and we think it‚Äôs unfair to label it as only usable for men. Because we are women, we had a really hard time figuring out how to use it, cause our dumb girl brains couldn‚Äôt figure it out! Just kidding, we really loved this candle. What we loved the most about it was that it didn‚Äôt smell like men (#cancelmen2020). It smells musky and earthy. LOVELY!!!"
4,6-Nov-19,2,"Cute, no smell I‚Äôve been looking for a soy based candle and was optimistic but this candle is small and the scent is great but you need to put you face within 3 inches to smell anything. I won‚Äôt be buying again."
4,28-Jun-20,5,"Awesome product, highly recommend! This product is amazing! The scent filled my entire house. I bought 3 different scents, and had a difficult time choosing which one I was going to keep for myself.  The best part though is that it's made in the USA! High quality, slow burning and just perfect!  Highly recommend this product!"
4,14-Aug-20,5,"Truly awesome! I was skeptical when others posted about the amazing smell of this candle, because I‚Äôve been burned before (pun intended) by reviews, however, this candle TRULY smells amazing! I am so glad I got it!"
4,10-Oct-20,2,"SOY????? The candle is very strange to me, wonderfully designed, but for the price and size, you would think the scent is amazing, but this fresh-linen smells more like perfumed bleach and when you blow out the candle it has a pleasant after-smell that doesn‚Äôt last long, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll be buying again, this could also be because its soy"
4,17-Apr-19,3,"Very lightly scented This candle projects almost no scent. Definitely not what I was looking for. Also, it's smaller than I expected (which is my fault). The 6 oz is about 3""x3"". Seems to burn slowly and evenly, though."
4,2-Sep-20,5,Smells amazing Smells perfect I love nag champa insence and this was a gift for someone they love it as it smells just like the insence also very good burn time on the candle
4,17-Jul-20,5,"Smells great, please make in bigger size Edit: I tried a 2nd candle, Brown sugar and OUD! I have never had an OUD scented candle so I am still getting use to it. I love the brown sugar scent, and I am sure once I get use to the combo I will love it too!my favorite candle scent of all time!! My only problem is that it only comes in the 6oz size, I would love for it to be in a 9oz jar!!"
4,28-Apr-20,5,"Love this candle! This candle is great for those of us who go through candles like it's our job. I tend to light candles on a daily basis and keep them burning throughout a large portion of the day, and I found myself having to buy candles almost as consistently as groceries. I was looking for a soy candle that would burn longer, and better quality, and I believe I've found it! Loving it so far, and the pineapple evergreen scent combination pleasantly surprised me! Will continue to order!"
4,14-Nov-20,5,"The reviews don't lie.Great candle! Really enjoyed the sleek look and design of the candle.It seems to be slow burning as advertised. Item could go anywhere in the home and compliment the space.Scent is subtle,  but awesome!! I believe this item would be a perfect gift for Xmas."
4,26-Jun-20,5,Smells Amazing This candle not only smells great but also lasts really long. This is one of the only candles that actually lasts as long as it says it does. I would have never thought to but an Evergreen and Pineapple candle but it was so highly recommended in the reviews that I gave it it shot. Well worth it. Very refreshing scent and it hits every corner of my living room.
4,28-Feb-20,4,"6oz lasted 41 hours Purchased 6oz No. 4 lasted 42 hours, decent for a 6oz but could be better for price, candles right? Overall pretty ok."
4,17-Jun-20,5,Lovely Scent for a Small Room I use this in my office as I work from home.  It's just enough to fill up the room and is just sweet enough without being overpowering.  Vanilla can be very sweet but the tobacco rounds it out to keep it fresh and not overly fake. Would recommend and buy again!
4,11-Sep-19,1,Save your money Not worth the price I get more sent from a fabric sheet than I did from this candle I did both of them and a small room and you couldn't smell nothing only the wick when you blew it out
4,3-Jul-19,5,"These are AMAZING candles. I initially bought one of these as a gift but HAD to go buy one for myself too. The Lemon Biscotti scent is one of my favorites...it makes our whole house smell like something tasty is in the oven. The quality is really great. It's a little pricy for the size, but does last a while."
4,30-Dec-19,5,EXPRESSO BEAN SMELLS WONDERFUL !! ... even w/o using it as a candle. Candle smell lasts longer than the regular Glade products. I'm definitely going to buy other scents when this one is used up.
4,3-Aug-20,5,"Smells Fantastic This smells amazing! It seems to burn slowly, which is also a plus. I am really satisfied. Buying candles online is risky, but this scent and product did not disappoint."
4,28-May-20,5,"Scent of candle is Amazing The smell of this candle is awesome. I hate floral scented candles. But this candle smells like the deep forest. I will definitely order this again, for myself and for friends. I am going to buy some other candles from Lulu! So that's where I'm going now..."
4,9-May-19,5,Simply Great! I recently realized the impact that a great smelling candle can have on a home. This led to my discovery of this candle. Now I had tried other candles before but this was simply just another level. It sets the bar real high. The scent is so soothing and not at all overwhelming. What's fantastic about it is that the scent lasts way past you blow it out. I have no doubt it'll last a while due to the fact that I've used it for at least 6 hours and it doesn't show much of a difference from when it was new. Definitely a fan. Will be trying all of the other scents!
4,7-Jan-20,4,"Pleasantly scented soy candle that lasts! The scent is pleasant, but has a slight sweet, flavored coffee aroma. I was hoping it would not be sweet at all and just smell like fresh ground or brewed coffee.  I initially burned the candle for a couple of hours.  It barely looks like it has been lit.  Very pleased to see it will last a while."
4,3-Aug-20,4,"Tabaco candle is very fancy This candle is so smoky and warm. Like entering a log cabin!The throw is about 8/10 and very spice oriented. I really like how fancy it makes my room smell, kind of like an upperclass boutique.It‚Äôs longevity is decent, but I have only lit it for about 6 hours (nonconsecutively) and is 25% in.I like it a lot, but definitely too refined and perfumy than what I would like for my taste.I recommend for a living room rather than a bedroom."
4,12-Oct-20,4,"Excellent candle.  Smells great. I've been looking for a tobacco scented candle, and my wife bought this one for me.  Sits on my desk and I enjoy it each morning.  Highly recommended."
4,28-Aug-20,1,"Sad, arrived damaged ! Love this brand of candle When the candle arrived it was ruined! The wax had completely melted over the side of jar onto the wrapping paper and covered the wick !  I love these candles I buy them all the time they smell amazing . The choices of scents is awesome and they burn clean !"
4,20-May-20,5,Smells AMAZINGGGGG I've been really into candles again and I purchased this one to have a pleasant scent for the bathroom when needed. I absolutely LOVE it. I also purchased the Coffee scented one for my coffee bar.
4,15-Sep-20,5,"Best Candle Money Can Buy! This lovely scent permeates around the house while burning it, and leaves the house smelling amazing for days after burning! Rest assured this candle is 100% soy based so it won‚Äôt fill your home with harmful chemicals like many of the other leading candles will. Highly recommend this candle! I purchased the scent ‚Äòsugared pecans‚Äô but I can imagine the other scents are just as great."
4,24-Sep-20,5,Light fresh scent that isn‚Äôt overwhelming. -pineapple evergreen I got the pineapple evergreen candle last Xmas and just bought two more this week. One for me and one for a friend. I‚Äôm super sensitive to smells and this is the only candle that doesn‚Äôt give me a headache or smell artificial. It‚Äôs light and makes the whole house smell amazing.
4,8-Jun-20,5,Fills the room This is one of the only soy candles I‚Äôve had that the smell actually carries to a large area while the candle doesn‚Äôt burn up quickly. Highly recommend for people that are missing that coffeeshop smell. This really fills a room and burns slowly.
4,18-Apr-20,1,Nothing like what the reviews portray I trusted the robust positive reviews if these candles because I‚Äôm always burning candles and looking for new ones at a reasonable price. I ordered the two pack of the Pineapple Evergreen scent. Wasn‚Äôt anything short of being just Pineapple...not impressed at all with the scent. I‚Äôm returning them because I‚Äôm so disappointed. They are very small and the scent doesn‚Äôt infiltrate even a small room.
4,19-Nov-20,5,"Great smell! Very pleasant and manly. The smell is wonderful! Subtle jasmine notes, with pleasing Oud and Sandalwood scent. Manly, but smooth and pleasant.The packaging was very impressive, like opening an expensive present.My only ""issue"" would be that the wood lid is not included."
4,10-Nov-20,4,"Great smelling but inaccurate scent name This candle burns long and smells great, but it doesn't smell as much as espresso as I'd hoped. I still like the candle a lot and would buy another."
4,26-Apr-20,5,Strong scent. But good Great gift. But the person I gifted it too said it smells too much like cake so it just makes them want to eat cake so they don't actually use it. But the presentation is great and it does smell nice.
4,6-Nov-20,3,"How strong is the scent? If you were looking strictly for a birthday present, the box and container  in which the candle comes are a nice touch.  I was looking for a strong chocolate scent that would provide a nice chocolately environment to be in.  For my purposes, the candle's scent was not strong enough.  The candel mainly has the scent of any other candel.  It's greatest impact is when you smell it unlit.  I would not spend the money they are asking for the candel."
4,17-Jul-20,1,"Used candle, no scent This candle arrived with a blackened wick, ash crumbles, and smeared wax (not residual) on the side.... this was not from heat alone, but from prior USAGE of the candle before even arriving to me). Additionally, the faint scent has no throw. I adore the blueberry cobbler one: burns evenly, richly scented (fills the whole room), so this one was a stark contrast. Very disappointed.  Will likely not purchase them anymore due to receiving such poor quality/lack of attention to detail."
4,9-Apr-20,5,Smells great! I am picky about scents and usually have to smell every candle on a shelf to make a decision. Since I haven't been able to go to the store (because of COVID-19 restrictions) I took a risk and was happy with the result. This candle is lightly scented and just smells like a little burst of clean. The scent isn't fruity or perfumey. It's been burning for a couple hours a day for a week and has only burnt down about halfway. I will order more in the future.
4,31-May-20,5,Great Candle This is a soy candle. It burns clean. There is no smoke just a fresh scent. It lasts a long time. The wick is very high quality. It is the best candle that I have ever bought.
4,11-Jun-20,5,"Smells so good! This candle smells so good that it makes me hungry! I was going to give it as a gift, but when I smelled it I decided to keep it for myself. Do yourself a favor and get this candle!"
4,26-May-20,5,"So Fresh & So Clean! First and foremost, as an artist and designer, I really appreciate beautiful packaging and I just love the clean, modern packaging design of Lulu Candles; I was so excited when I opened my package! I ordered a ""wild lemongrass"" 6 oz-er and the fresh, lemony scent of this candle is mouth-puckering yet very natural and clean at the same time and is perfect for spring and summer! I will definitely shop Lulu Candles again for not only myself, but for wonderful gifts for my friends and family as well."
4,4-Jun-20,5,"must have! this candle company is my new favorite! this scent reminds me of a clean baby powder and is extremely pleasant. I tend to go through candles quickly but after keeping it lit for over 4-6 hours a day, it just now ran out (delivered and first lit 5/22). other scents purchased were lavender musk & amber rose; highly recommend all three ‚ú®"
4,13-May-20,3,Little to no discernible scent Disappointed I really like the idea of the smell but I‚Äôve burnt this a few times and cannot spell anything. Disappointed and I would not recommend.
4,24-Apr-20,2,"Candle Lid UNREMOVABLE Everything about the candle is wonderful.  I was only able to enjoy it after breaking the glass so I could get the lid off though.  The lid would not come off.  For fifteen minutes, after putting a rubber band around the top, I tried to wrestle it off.  I tried every trick I know in the book.  It's a pleasant candle, but there was something wrong with the lid which made it completely uunremovable."
4,5-Feb-20,5,"This is a great candle I loved the scent of this candle and the long burn time.  I ordered the Pineapple Evergreen scent and it is delicious.  I appreciate whoever was creative enough to come up with this combination.  Also, I love the pretty white jar.  I think it is elegant and would make the perfect gift.  However, this one is for me.  Smiles."
4,26-Jul-20,3,"Meh Evergreen pineapple was a bit too cloying and sweet for my taste. I‚Äôd prefer the evergreen notes to be stronger. Linen is a gentle scent, better IMO, though it doesn‚Äôt make me want to burn the candle much. Neither of these is as delicious as I was hoping :-/ I guess it‚Äôs better to buy candles in person so you can really tell if it‚Äôs a smell you crave."
4,24-Nov-20,5,"Amazing Quality! I ordered this candle because I heard it was a good dupe for the candle Taylor Swift uses in her house (not sure if they actually smell the same as I have never smelled T.Swift's house...) and it smells AMAZING!! Such a good everyday house smell without being too overbearing. It also looks so cute, chic and exactly what I was expecting from the pictures! This candle also came super quick and was well packaged to ensure it would not break! 10/10 would recommend!!"
4,12-Jan-20,5,"Nice juniper candle for the holidays I bought the juniper leaf candle for the holiday season, and we have really liked it so far.  It's got a clean but warm scent that's very fit for the holidays.  The smell is strong so that we always know when it's burning but it's not overpowering."
4,14-Sep-20,5,New favorite coffee scent This is the best coffee scent.  This is by far my favorite coffee scent and I have tried several.  Anything coffee scented has always been my favorite and this candle is perfect.  I can‚Äôt actually drink coffee (long story) but this candle makes me feel like I just walked into the nicest cafe ever!
4,14-Nov-20,5,My new favorite candles!!! I will be buying a few extra to gift this Christmas. The scent never fades and there is no smell of smoke like other candles while it‚Äôs burning!
4,23-Apr-19,5,Pineapple Evergreen Candle is a MUST I had this brand of candle recommended to me by a friend. I had a hard time picking a scent because they all sounded so good! I ended up picking the pineapple evergreen flavor because I was really intrigued by how the two would work together. I just got it and it smells AMAZING. Literally the best smelling candle I have ever owned. Highly recommend!!!!!
4,6-Dec-19,5,"SMELLS AMAZING! I first received a lulu candle in the pineapple evergreen scent from a friend for my birthday last August. The first time I burned it my family all agreed it was our favorite candle yet. The fragrance is perfect. I ordered 4 more recently - one for me, and 3 as Christmas gifts. I'm sure everyone will enjoy it as much as we have!"
4,10-Jun-20,5,"BEST from Amazon Hello! I order candles on Amazon every other week for our office. I hit the jackpot with this one! The scent is subtle and clean, which is the best kind of candle. I definitely plan to shop lulucandlecollection again in the future! Great product. Also, if you would like to use this for a gift, it comes in a small brown box that you could wrap. The candle itself is decorated super cute and has a nice label to be able to fit into any type of home/office/gift situation."
4,14-Jul-20,4,"Lulu Candies - long lasting, Clean Burning I ordered Lulu candles in Lemongrass and Pineapple Evergreen. Both scents fill the room and smell great!  I personally ally prefer the Pineappld Evergreen. Lemongrass is more of a clean scent, like linen, if that‚Äôs your jam. They are smaller than I expected but even after 2-3  hours  of being lit, the candle wax only melted a small amount.  So I suspect these will last for awhile. They burn cleanly and don‚Äôt create any smoke. I‚Äôm looking forward to trying more of their scents."
4,17-Jun-20,5,"Smells Great! I cannot comment on the longevity, I am giving it to a friend as a gift. It comes in a cute box and smells great. A little smaller than I thought it would be for the price, but still cute."
4,9-Oct-20,5,Satisfied Updated-I also purchased Apple cinnamon candle - the scent is also powerful and seasonal.The sugared pecans smells very sweet and nice. The whole house smells so good. The scent is strong but not too strong. I would recommend it.
4,12-Apr-19,3,"Nice I was expecting this candle to be a little more fragrant. When I moved it into my bathroom, the sent became a lot more noticeable and I loved it. I think if you are looking for a candle to make your living room fragranced, this isn‚Äôt the candle. Works best in smaller rooms."
4,12-Apr-20,5,"Love this candle This candle was gifted to me and I absolutely love it! I love the smell of coffee, and this candle has such a cozy scent that isn't overpowering or headache-inducing like some other coffee-scented candles I have tried in the past. It has such a cute, sleek design and although I have only had it for a few days, I have burned it quite a bit and can tell it's going to last for a while. Highly recommend if you appreciate the warm, cozy smell of coffee!"
4,27-Jun-20,4,"Smells good but not very strong I went with this scent because I read other reviews saying this one is the best and I was not disappointed. Smells delish. Only thing that took a star off is it just doesn‚Äôt seem to fill the room with the scent, I can only really smell it if I stand a couple feet away."
4,4-Jan-19,1,Small expensive Small expensive
4,23-Sep-20,5,Perfect candle for a sweet friend The fresh linen scent is great! It is not too strong but also not too light. Just the right amount of scent and the size is perfect for a gift.
4,10-Jun-20,5,Smell at first light :) This candle smells amazing from first light. I didn't think i could love a candle so much. We use this candle in our bedroom and living room. Fills the rooms nicely
4,25-Sep-19,5,"Smell amazing I had received one of these candles for a gift, and I loved it!!! I love it so much that now I buy them for all my friend and family as gifts and they all love them! My favorite scent is espresso!"
4,27-Jun-20,5,"Lives up to the reviews I was skeptical‚Äî- so many good reviews- it actually makes me doubt the product. But, it really does have a long lasting scent! I will order another for sure!"
4,21-Oct-20,5,"Nice candle It comes first a more down low fragrance but after warm-up a bit, the scent gets stronger and stronger. At a point you would feel the smell is enough so you stop light it for a while, then it lasts longer. It suits anyone who wants your room or bed to get on the mild cologne flavor."
4,5-Feb-20,5,"Coffee house scented heaven! I adore the scent of coffee in my home, but so many candles out there are far too sweet smelling to suit me. This candle definitely captures the real richness and tangy bite of the scent in a coffee house. Provides a long lasting, soothing aroma long after my coffee pot is cold! Simple black label on a white candle goes anywhere in the house. Lasts about as long as expected for any soy candle. Would absolutely recommend to any other coffee lovers out there."
4,29-Dec-19,5,Smells Glorious! The fragrance is exactly what I expected.  And it is highly fragrant.  I haven't lit it yet but in my experience Lulu Candles have good longevity.  I will definitely purchase again.
4,16-Sep-20,4,"Fresh-cut Lemongrass Just this candle.This is the candle for you if you like the smell of fresh cut lemongrass. Its lite without being to over powering, a nice fresh smell."
4,2-Jan-20,4,Not For Me I found the vanilla scent too much of a top note.  Scent is so subjective and most reviewers love the scent....but it's just not for me.  I'll send it back and try another
4,17-Jun-20,5,"Candle scent is great and strong! I ordered this candle as a gift for my sister's birthday. The lemongrass scent was amazing, I almost wanted to keep it for myself! The candle design is sleek, I love the look of the label too. She loved it and can't wait to use it in her new apartment! Would definitely recommend this candle to anyone."
4,29-Jul-20,1,"No scent. Very disappointed Very disappointed. I‚Äôve bought from Lulu Tabacco Vanilla before and I fell in love with it so I thought of buying a bigger one, amber rose. I‚Äôve had the candle lit up for hours and I cannot smell anything. I left it on for about 5 hours on 3 different days and still nothing. I‚Äôm very sad that this candle let me down."
4,5-Jan-20,5,"Great gift for health concious people! Overall, this is a great candle from a great company. I gave this as a present and they have used it quite frequently since Christmas and the candle has not burned that much which means it will last quite a while. The only thing that could be an issue is for the first couple times it was used, the scent that was generated was quite potent, but since then the scent has not been quite as strong. initially when it was stronger, it was too strong for me but now I enjoy the candle. Overall a great candle!"
4,21-Feb-19,5,"Score! I bought this fresh linen scent for my daughter, as well as one other scent.She loves them both. But, I guess she got tired of me continuously coming into her room to smell the Fresh Linen one.....because she ended up giving it to me. ?üòÇIt seriously is the best thing I have ever smelled."
4,11-Jan-20,5,"My new favorite candle THESE ARE THE BEST CANDLES. Long-lasting, great scents.The pineapple evergreen is incredible. I've purchased four of them over the last couple of months because I burn them whenever I'm home. This is my absolute favorite candle ever.We also really like the Tobacco Spice and Vanilla. We burn that one in the master bedroom and the Pineapple Evergreen in the living room. Lulu Candles are nothing short of fantastic."
4,28-Oct-20,5,"Lovely scented candle I love this candle, particularly the midnight tin Paris Scent, it‚Äôs just a delicious scent. I have bought several of them already. Recommended."
4,30-Oct-20,2,Has no scent It doesn‚Äôt smell like anything. The bigger one from TJ maxx that was half the price smelled so much better. Glad I cancelled the other one.
4,18-Apr-20,5,Very pleasant for large rooms This is one of the best smelling candles I've had in some time. Most candles just don't cover the large rooms that we have. This candles did just enough that it was pleasant without being overwhelming. I will definitely be purchasing another one.
4,18-Oct-20,5,"You won't be disappointed. I found this candle to be very nice- I bought the fresh linen, to get a more neutral kind of smell from it, and it delivered. I was concerned that the candle being smaller(6oz) and a more neutral scent, it wouldn't fill up my space as much. It did exceptionally well though, and through 12 or so hours of burning, I've used probably around an oz of wax. Also being paraben free, you really can't go wrong with this candle. Will definitely be ordering another."
4,20-Mar-20,5,Great candle I really like this candle--this is my second one. The smell is really nice and not overpowering. Not perfume-y like lots of other candles. The lemongrass scent is genuine.
4,31-Jan-20,5,"Smells amazing Amazing scent... I could live in this candle!!! Even after burning for a couple hours it barely made a dent. And, such a bonus, I got lazy and didn't cut the wick.... no crazy black smoke. I will definitely recommend to friends and will order again"
4,4-Mar-20,5,"Don‚Äôt think about it, buy this candle. This linen candle has the best scent. It is definitely a candle to be savored. It smells so good. A true smell that is subtle and refreshing. Would make a lovely hostess gift or a gift to yourself!"
4,8-Dec-19,5,"Beautiful aesthetics and aroma With Amazon Prime, my candle arrived sooner than expected--always an unexpected delight! The packaging is of stunning design, the soy a welcome source for a burning medium, and the aroma both exceptional and pleasing. I chose Fresh Linen which reminds me of Peanuts' Linus and Snoopy and Charlie Brown, I forget which, exclaiming that happiness is a drawer of warm socks fresh from the laundry. Another candle arrives tomorrow. My opinion: A great value, a pretty product, and a Lulu of a buy."
4,29-Mar-20,5,"Small candle, big scent This candle smells lovely. I went with pineapple evergreen base on the reviews and it's fruity and clean smelling. I will definitely be trying more scents. I like the look of the candle as well. Makes a great gift for male or female."
4,13-Jun-20,5,"Smells Nice Great scented candle and this one was for a good cause‚Äî $3 donation went to help rescuing abandoned animals! And after this leaving this review, they‚Äôll send me a free travel tin candle as well!! So many wins. I got this candle for my bathroom and it‚Äôs the perfect accent that was needed‚Äî it‚Äôs a cute size with a strong lavender musk scent."
4,31-May-20,5,"Clean, fresh, long lasting candle! Lovely, clean scent that fills the room.  We burn ours in our large den with the family.  My stepdaughter loved it so much, I am buying the same scent for her.  I will definitely keep this candle around throughout the year."
4,2-Aug-20,5,"Intensely fragrant This candle may be small, but its one of the most fragrant candles I've ever had. I absolutely love it.  As soon as it was lit I was able to smell the rich tobacco smell."
4,2-Apr-20,5,Absolutely Delicious!!! I bought the Sexy Man candle and it is the ultimate scent. I am obsessed with the way it smells and it burns to evenly and nice.It is the nicest gift to give someone (aka MYSELF). Really fresh smelling and not too overpowering. Def going to buy another!!!
4,3-Sep-20,5,"Love this candle - and so does my teenage son I bought this for my 17 year old son who complained of a stinky bedroom :)He has allergies, so we have to be careful about scents and candle materials.He loves this candle, and so do I.The scent reminds us all of Pop Pop's pipe - warm and comforting.We liked it so much, we ordered another two candles."
4,22-Nov-19,5,2 pack 9 oz Pinapple Evergreen I purchased this package as my holiday entertaining candles.  The two candles scent my 1200 sq ft area subtly and elegantly.  The jar is a slightly opaque creamy white color which glows when lit.  The label is understated and well placed (straight).  The size is versatile.  I have one standing alone and the other is the centerpiece in a table arrangement.  The product was securely packed for shipping and arrived in perfect condition.  This candle would be a classy gift for any candle lover.
4,30-Dec-19,5,"Amazing in every aspect. Omg, ok this item is amazing!!!!!!Like it's so good, I opened the package and I can already smell how good it is. I got the passiofruit mango one and it burns so beautifully.The colour looks niceThe scent is amazingAnd it's not like one of those cheap ones that makes everything oily and turns into molten liquid the second you light it.All in all I would say 5/5 would deff buy again!"
4,28-Dec-19,5,"Great scent! I am in love with the Passionfruit sense!  I simultaneously bought a different set of candles and there is a big difference in the smell the candles produce.  The Lulu candle emanates such subtle scent and yet so very delicious, and yet the other one I bought smelled very delicious but when burning, the scent is too strong to the point it gives you a headache.  Definitely pleased with the purchase and my bathroom smells swimmingly!"
4,16-May-20,5,"Such a lovely smell! Bought the Jasmine-Infused Bergamot scent on a whim because the name was enticing and this brand already had great reviews. The scent is very floral and bright. I was looking for a soy candle that wasn't overpriced and had a long burn time. I haven't had the chance to really try it out yet, but I'm already so pleased with taking a chance on the scent. Plus, the candle came in quicker than I anticipated! Overall, I'd recommend this scent and the candle!"
4,9-Dec-19,1,A waste of money. I can‚Äôt smell anything unless I‚Äôm literally right next to it! And STILL had a very very light smell. I wish I didn‚Äôt buy another candle from this company. Always buy one thing at a time you never know if you won‚Äôt like it because I sure don‚Äôt. You can definitely find better candles.
4,21-Jul-20,5,"smells like fresh brewed coffee I have ordered at least 5 or 6 of the espresso candles in the small and medium size. They are AMAZING!My entire room will smell like coffee (which is what I wanted) after burning for just a short time.My family keeps ""borrowing"" mine until I buy another one ;)Great for any room, give as gifts or horde all for yourself!The smaller size come with a cute wooden cap/top."
4,22-Sep-20,5,"Unique pineapple evergreen scent, lovely scent, great gift for yourself or others The pineapple evergreen scent was my first Lulu Candles purchase and I love it. Slightly smaller candle size than expected. The scent is balanced and fragrant (the box it came in even held its scent!). Neutral label would make this a great gift for a man or a woman and would fit in with many housing decor styles. Cost is reasonable for the quality and many higher priced candles simply aren't as good. I would buy again and plan to try other scents too."
4,5-Nov-20,5,"Unique Aroma Chose this scent flavor because it sounded unique and was getting great reviews. Well I‚Äôm in full agreeance! I had it delivered at work and couldn‚Äôt light it right away but I set it on my desk with the lid off. My coworkers loved the scent, even not lit! Definitely excited to choose a few more scents. Finally lit the candle once home and it has a very clean burn, which is why soy candles rock!"
4,24-Sep-20,5,"Surprisingly Wonderful I was initially going to buy another scented candle in this series but I read a review that said ‚Äúhear me out on the pineapple evergreen‚Äù and I am SO HAPPY I did.It does indeed sound ridiculous. How could a pi?±a colada on the beach and fresh air of the rocky mountains go together...Well let me tell you, it‚Äôs delightful! I will likely buy again."
4,27-Jul-20,5,"My favorite candle. There are two things I LOVE- wine and candles. I have searched high and low to find the scents that my heart adores. Lulu No 14 is hard to beat. It is a close dupe to Santal 33 but much more affordable. It‚Äôs soy blend which makes me feel better about daily use because I‚Äôm not a huge fan of breathing in parrafin. For its tiny size, the throw is large. My only wish is that Amazon sold it in a larger size. Thank you Lulu!!! I love my new No. 14!!!"
4,31-May-20,4,"Nice candle Ordered cedar wood infused mango. Great scent. It‚Äôs different, not what you see usually but a very good mix and fills the room nicely. Good packaging though the candle is a little smaller than anticipated. Overall I‚Äôd buy again."
4,29-Feb-20,5,Awesome candle. I love the smell. It is on the mellow side and is not punget. The smell does not give me any headache. I actually wish the scent was slightly stronger.
4,29-Dec-19,1,These candles have a very short lifespan of less than a week I lovedThe candles but in fortunately in two days they‚Äôre completely gone they don‚Äôt last that long I have better luck at Walmart candles last over a month so that being said I do not recommend this item
4,19-Oct-20,5,Great Candle This tobacco candle smells much more like tobacco then the vanilla.  My husband doesn't like strong scents so I thought a manly smell would work for him. . . . I love lulu candles.
4,26-Aug-19,5,"Wonderful Candles! I love these candles!  Clean burning and great scents.  Of course the Buttercream Vanilla smelled scrumptious, but I wasn't sure what to expect from the Pineapple Evergreen scent, but wanted to give it a try.  I think it's my new favorite scent. Mostly Pineapple comes thru with a hint of the evergreen, it's wonderful!  Will definitely order again!"
4,20-Dec-19,5,"LOVE! Perfect Aniversary Gift! I got this candle as part of an anniversary gift for my husband because the traditional gift for year 2 is cotton (I love that these have cotton wicks)! The packaging and label is so nice, the scent is AMAZING. We both just love it. Awesome brand!"
4,14-Dec-19,5,"A wonderful, powerful little candle! I bought the blueberry cobbler 6oz and I can‚Äôt believe how it infuses the entire house with a wonderful scent. It‚Äôs powerful but not overwhelming I that makes sense. I also love that it‚Äôs soy sonit doesn‚Äôt bother my allergies like other candles. As far as longevity, I have burnt the 6oz for 72 hrs and it‚Äôs only burnt 1/4 down. I will definitely be buying other scents."
4,24-Oct-19,5,"Beautiful scent, packaging & product! Got this candle because it's a 'clean' product, soy/cotton wick (basically it emits no harmful chemicals, esp. now that it's colder and we light candles in the house in winter, and with kids, we don't want harmful chemicals from candles wafting around the house.)  Very happy with this candle, smell is beautiful & unique, long-lasting but not over-powering and packaging is beautiful, will order more!"
4,26-Apr-20,5,"Wow. This candle packs a punch. I have to say, it‚Äôs hard to purchase a candle without physically smelling it but WOW. The different scents blended together on this are incredible. You only need to light the candle in a room for maybe 15 minutes and the smell stays for awhile too. Although the candle was smaller than we expected, still highly recommend."
4,26-Jul-20,5,"Delicious I was hesitant on purchasing this candle based on the price, but it definitely didn't disappoint! It's long lasting, aesthetically pleasing, and smells divine! I will fasho purchase more when I run out :D"
4,19-Sep-20,5,Buy them!!! These smell AMAZING. I bought 2( the sugared pecans and the tobacco spice & vanilla). I‚Äôm definitely going to continue buying LULU candles! My house smells incredible and bonus for being a vegan candle!! I‚Äôm so happy with my purchase!
4,20-Feb-20,5,"Luxury Heaven Scent! I burn a ton of candles from many, many different vendors.  While at a restaurant in Virginia, I walked into the ladies room to see/smell this candle.  I almost different leave the bathroom.  The scent is that good!  Quite possible THE BEST scent I've ever smelled.  It's fresh, calming, relaxing and overall doesn't give me headache.  The price could be a lil better, but I'll give up a few coffee's for this.  You won't regret it!"
4,6-May-20,5,"This scent is amazing! I am a vanilla, cinnamon, baking-scented candle fan, but I couldn't get to my go-to store during the quarantine, so I ordered this candle after being intrigued by the combo (pineapple and evergreen)...oh my goodness, it's so fresh and clean smelling, perfect for spring, and just light. I smell it when I walk by, lightly, even when it's not lit. It's a happy scent. Big fan."
4,4-May-20,4,"Stong scent, clean burning I love the scent and that they are clean burning, but they are a little expensive for the size of the candle. It didn't last that long."
4,1-Dec-19,5,Super sexy candle! I‚Äôve been buying scented candles all my life. There‚Äôs something about this one that‚Äôs got me hooked!The scent is so nice and smooth. It just smells like luxury!! Great gift for all those candle lovers out there!!
4,10-Jan-20,3,"so tiny this is a great little gift if you want a small little something,  double check the dimensions before you buy.  whether it's long lasting or not it is overpriced"
4,17-May-20,5,Powerful little candle! This candle has such a strong scent. It can fill your whole space in minutes! Though is supposed to be ‚Äúmanly‚Äù it could really appeal to anyone.
4,17-Nov-20,5,"My new favorite candle Don't be fooled by the smaller size. This candle packs an aromatic, authentic coffee house punch. I keep one in my kitchen and just ordered a second for my home office."
4,8-Aug-20,5,"This candle is one of my best value purchases of 2020! I would never buy a candle online without knowing what it will smell like, but my roommate recommended this and I am in LOVE. Lighting this jasmine and sandalwood scent in the bathroom makes me feel like I have a spa at home. The packaging is also extremely simple, minimal, and classy - all for only $20. This is great as a gift (the packaging also came very secure) for someone else or yourself!"
4,8-Oct-20,5,Long lasting candle Lulu Candales are my favorite candles because they last a very long time and are reasonably priced.  The aroma is spot on as described.  I just purchased the Ocean Breeze and have had several Wild Lemongrass candles in the past.  Both scents are fresh and clean.  The white glass container is great for repurposing after the candle wax is gone.  Hands down my favorite candle company.
4,8-Oct-20,5,"Beautiful spy candle giving me serious fall vibes! I was so excited to get this candle as I love the smell of pipe tobacco and the notes of vanilla and spice just blended seamlessly. The candle glass is nice! I immediately lit the candle as soon as I unboxed it! Even my husband likes it, he usually hates when I burn or scent anything!"
4,12-Nov-20,5,"Best candle I've had I got this candle to help with stress and anxiety and every time I light it, it really does help so much. The smell fills up my whole room pretty quickly and isnt too strong. Great candle! will be getting more"
4,15-Oct-20,5,"Eliminates odors immediately Long lasting candle, immediately negates bad smells and replaces with a strong yet subtle scent. Perfect for bathrooms, or areas that smell strongly of our beloved four legged children."
4,11-Feb-20,5,"Yummy scent...straight up coffee... I've been looking for a coffee scented candle that didn't have any other scents mixed in - hard to find unless you want sweet 'latte' scents.. I have this candle sitting on my desk and have lit it once, only because the scent is so nice even just sitting there..I will buy again! This coffee lover is happy with this purchase..."
4,14-Jul-20,5,Smells great The smell of this small candle is pretty strong for my bedroom with a king size bed.  The smell is also very pleasant.  Love the simple design.
4,9-Oct-20,3,I‚Äôve had better Scent is great but it‚Äôs small. Slow burning so lasts awhile for the money . Overall it‚Äôs a good candle but I have found better at better prices .
4,16-Jan-19,1,Was a bust The fragrance is barely detectable.
4,6-Dec-19,4,"Holiday staple Exactly what I was looking for. I bought the Juniper Leaf candle and it is a wonderful mix of pine and spice. I have a fake christmas tree so I always purchase a tree-scented candle to make the living room smell like I have the real deal. This is my first time buying a Lulu candle and it will not be the last. I could smell the festive candle from the box. It is a beautiful scent for the holidays. The jar is smaller than expected for the price, but it is cute and giftable too."
4,5-Aug-20,5,"AAAAAMAZING! Normally, I am not a huge fan of fruit scented anything, but the evergreen aspect of this balances out any sweetness. I am writing this, then buying another because it is so intoxicating. The small ones are still powerful and the scent travels quite well. Hope you enjoy your candle escapades!"
4,30-Aug-20,5,"Go-to online candle purchase! Admittedly, buying candles you‚Äôve never sniffed before online is a little risky, but I was so pleased when this arrived and found that it was a really great smell. I purchased the clean linen and also black amber. Both are really great and help make our little house super comfy.The packaging was great, no damage. Also I‚Äôm a fan of the simple label and white candle. Goes great with our mid century mid-esque home."
4,7-Jun-20,5,"Very Pleased I am always very hesitant to order candles without smelling them first.  Based on other reviews, I gave this one a try.  It smells lovely-- it is strong but not over powering.  It fills the room when burning.  The presentation is beautiful and I plan to gift this in the future.  Burns clean and, despite burning it for hours already, there is not much on the inside of the jar and still tons of candle left.  Very satisfied with this purchase and eager to try other scents."
4,16-Oct-19,5,Can't get enough I have 4 or 5 of this brands candles. They are all amazing. I got my sister hooked on them too. This is probably my favorite scent. They go in any room and a good price for the quality.
4,9-Apr-20,5,WOW! Smells A M A Z I N G. I got the espresso bean candle as a gift for a friend and I am so jealous! I might just have to get one for myself
4,7-Apr-20,5,Great smelling candle! I bought this product to use while working from home.  The candle is so refreshing and smells amazing.  I have been burning it all day and have yet to see the candle size change.  Thank you!
4,8-Apr-19,1,"Not great Very,very disappointed in this item.  Didn‚Äôt expect it to be so small and there is no noteworthy scent at all."
4,6-Jul-20,5,Fresh and clean scent! This is my favorite scent so far that I‚Äôve tried from this company. It‚Äôs light and fresh and I always get compliments when people are over. It lasts a long time too and I always have one burning.
4,24-Oct-20,5,"Smells Great! Got this candle because I love the scent of coffee. And my room mate just got a dog that isn't smelly, but just adds to dog smell in the house. obviously we clean. but this candle just makes the house smell so good and you can't smell a hint of dog.  Left it lit for an entire day and it barely looks used up so I suspect the longevity is great. but can't say for certain since I've only had it a few days."
4,16-Jul-20,5,Fantastic highly scented candle! I wasn‚Äôt sure about the tobacco scent when I ordered so I bought the small size. I wish I had gotten the larger! This candle smells so great and really warms up my home. I‚Äôll definitely be trying some of the other scents too!
4,23-Jun-20,5,"Lulu candles are the best natural candles on amazon! I have bought several Lulu candles, and they are the best amazon has to offer! They consistently smell AMAZING, and they accurately represent their products when they say they are natural (unlike many others on amazon). The Buttercream Vanilla Cupcake smells exactly like a buttercream cupcake, and the packaging is nice if you want to give it as a gift :)"
4,26-Oct-20,5,If only there was smellavision This candle is beyond what I expected! Within minutes it filled my living room with the aroma! I would recommend this and buy it again. Wish it was a tad more affordable. I would put one in every room lol.
4,19-Aug-20,2,Not strong scent Located the candle in my small home office and can‚Äôt smell it at all. When you smell the candle it has a good scent but not strong at all.Seems to burn slowly and clean.Delivered during hot summer so candle was melted and I had to dig out the wick and put the candle back together.
4,17-May-20,5,BEST candle ever This is my 2nd time buying Lulu candles. The scent is Amazing; one 9 oz. candle makes my entire bedroom smell beautiful. They burn slowly and without mess. I highly recommend Lulu soy candles.
4,30-Aug-18,5,"The candles are GREAT!!!!!!!! I ordered 2 types of candles:  Lemon grass and linen.  They were delivered one day after they were ordered.  When I opened the box, they were individually wrapped (very well) and did not break.  Like no other candles, I could smell the scents through the lid; very nice scents.  Anyone purchasing this brand of candle will be very pleased."
4,28-Jul-20,5,"Smells Amazing Loved the smell of the pineapple evergreen. Very interesting smell combining tropical with mountain-like smell. I do wish the candle was a bit more affordable. But it does burn somewhat slower than other candles, which lasted longer than I thought it would."
4,26-Jul-20,5,"Amazingly strong scent! I am always looking for soy candles that have a strong scent, and this one definitely does the trick! I got lemon & vanilla bean and it fills up my entire apartment with a wonderful and relaxing aroma. One of the best soy candles I‚Äôve come across!"
4,5-Oct-19,5,"Amazing smell, no toxins, no headache This is one of the best candles I have tried and I‚Äôm obsessed and by a lot of candles. The smell is amazing (I got the sweet pea, jasmine and apple). My roomates came in my room to see what smelt so good. I wanted a soy healthy candle without toxins and this is perfect. It‚Äôs smaller then I was expecting but it lasts and burns for a while! If you‚Äôre thinking about purchasing it don‚Äôt wait any longer and purchase !"
4,5-Apr-20,5,Luxury candle shipped QUICK My B&BW candles were taking forever to get here and so I went to Amazon to find something to hopefully get here in a week. I stumbled upon this Lulu candled and I couldn‚Äôt be more satisfied. The packaging was beautiful and would have been a perfect gift (to myself - lol). Would highly recommend. The fragrance isn‚Äôt overpowering either... it actually smells like fresh linen.
4,22-Nov-19,4,"Amazing scent, 9 oz has no lid Love the pineapple evergreen scent, but make sure you get the one with the lid, if that's important to you. I bought the 9 oz and overlooked that it didn't come with a black lid and I wish I had seen that because the black lid gives it a chic look that I don't have now. Prompt delivery and good quality overall!"
4,15-Jul-20,5,"Smells amazing and burns slowly!! I recently bought this candle and I absolutely love it!! Most candles I can‚Äôt really smell until I leave the room and come back but this candle I could smell within 10 minutes of burning. I also left it lit last night for quite some time and it didn‚Äôt burn through the wax rapidly, which is great. I got the lavender scent and it smells amazing!!!"
4,2-Apr-20,1,Terribly disappointed ‚ÄúLemon Vanilla‚Äù I bought two of the lemon vanilla bean candles. One of them barely burns. Both of them smell AWFUL. No resemblance to lemon OR vanilla. Smells like you‚Äôre being exposed to a smoke cloud at a 1960s rock concert. Not my thing. So gross. Not able to return due to stay at home Covid19 order. Total waste of money. The company offers a free candle for a review. Must be why there are so many good reviews. Bribery? Good grief. Terrible.
4,6-Jan-20,5,Strong scent I love soy candles because they last so much longer and burn evenly! This scent is pretty strong though. I may return it or exchange it for something else.
4,22-Jun-20,5,Fragrance distinct but not overbearing. Love scented candles but majority of them are too strong and give me a headache.  Was pleased to come across Lulu Candle brand - the fragrance was distinct but subtle.  Have only tried Lemongrass but looking forward to trying other fragrances.
4,15-Feb-19,3,"Pretty But Not My Favorite The glass jar and label were pretty and I like that it's 100% soy, but the scent smells almost chemical-y, and I wish it came in a nicer box (rather than just a plain cardboard box). But I guess you get what you pay for. I want to return it but the cost of the return shipping makes it not worth it."
4,15-Oct-20,5,"Beautiful Jar and Great Scent The jars are simple and beautiful so it looks very nice sitting out.  The scent Pineapple Evergreen is fantastic and I will buy again.  It has a sweet smell and not a piney smell.  I also have the Lemongrass which has a nice scent too but I prefer Pineapple Evergreen.  I  love how the wax is soy, cotton wick, and poured in the US.  Great candle for home and gift."
4,15-Oct-20,5,"Great candle and son loves scent A gift for our son,He loves the scent and so far has just left it open to enjoy the scent without burning it. A big win"
4,19-Apr-20,3,"Smells great, uneven burn First off, I love the smell! Within a couple of hours the whole room smells so warm & inviting. However, I could not get it to burn evenly! I let it got for at least three hours to get the burn pool even but to no avail, it's concave in the middle."
4,29-Jun-20,5,"THE candle! This candle is GREAT!  The scent I ordered, Pineapple Evergreen, is very pleasant while not being too overpowering or too floral.  I purchased this as a gift for my uncle, who enjoyed it immensely and said that he had it lit for 4 days straight.  The actual candle is designed well, easily matching the decor of any setting it is placed in.  If you're looking for a simple yet elegant gift I highly recommend this candle.  I can't wait to order one for myself!"
4,4-Nov-20,5,The man I gave it to was very happy with it. I LOVED the clean smell of the candle and so did the man I gave it too. PLUS it didn't hurt his ego that it had Sexy Man on it. :)
4,12-Oct-20,5,"Slow burning candle Slow burning, excellent quality candles. I‚Äôve tried their pineapple scent and bergamot so far and just purchased a third yesterday. I go through a lot of candles so it‚Äôs nice to find quality ones at fair prices.  Will be ordering more in the near future."
4,24-Jun-19,5,Very Satisfied ... Great Product I used this candle to remove cooking smells from a neighbor which permeated my apartment . Worked like a charm ! Replaced the air with a pleasant aroma quickly while burning only a small amount of candle .
4,28-Sep-20,5,Good Quality I have been trying out various candles and scents - love this one! What sealed the deal is when my hubbie liked the way it smelled too. Good clean burn.
4,14-Oct-20,3,Weird scent I know a lot of people thought this was wonderful but it has a really really strange sent I don't think I would buy it again.
4,9-Jun-20,5,"The best!!! My new favorite candle.  The scent is strong enough to fill a large area but so soothing and calming.  The packaging is great, it‚Äôs not some annoying colorful mess.  In love!!!"
4,12-May-20,1,Scent is odorless I don‚Äôt know how this candle has so many good reviews but the Fresh Linen scent is unnoticeable unless you put it up to your nose or blow out the wick. Lit it for a long time too. Waist of money
4,23-Aug-20,5,"Very nicely made candle for a reasonable price I'm very excited to find a soy wax candle with cotton wick for this price, the paraffin wax ones are not good for you! The package came quick and was shipped in a neat little cardboard box. The design is very aesthetic and I do like the smell I bought (Cedarwood Mango). I thought the cedarwood would be predominant but it's actually a lot more mango, next time I am going to try buying a more explicitly woodsy smell."
4,3-Feb-20,5,It‚Äôs Really LOVELY It‚Äôs very beautiful and high end in appearance. The box it arrives in is very nice too. I am very happy with such a great scent choice. It‚Äôs different and really fills my dining area with scent.
4,18-Oct-20,4,"Pricey but great as a charming quality gift Pricey but great as a charming gift and longevity. Scent was noticeable in the office the next day after I had come back more than when I was in it. Unfortunately, Espresso Bean was more of a sweet coffee scent than what I was anticipating: the scent of freshly opened can of expresso beans. The Pineapple Evergreen was unique and I did enjoy it."
4,10-Jun-20,5,"Love this candle so much, will solidly buy more I bought this to take with me on work trips. The jar is appealing, the lid is an excellent feature, the candle is long burning (though I'm not done yet so can't say how many total hours it'll go), the fragrance is lovely, and the wax melts all the way across rather than leaving wasted wax around the circumference of the candle. I also love that it is soy based and I will definitely be buying more of these in the future."
4,20-Nov-20,5,Relax & Enjoy Love Lulu Candles. I keep one on my desk and light up every evening when I do my computer work. Relaxing and smells lovely.
4,24-May-20,5,The candle smells wonderful... I love the candles purchased and will continue to purchase them. The candles last long and so does the aroma. Excellent buy‚Ä¶. Packaged very well.
4,19-Jun-19,5,"Oh So Delicious! I LOVE this scent. The evergreen is reminiscent of Christmas but the fruity pineapple behind it gives it this sweet ,juicy deliciousness that makes it bright and fresh. The burn time is fantastic and, though the candle itself is minuscule, it packs a punch. I have been burning it for the past 4 days religiously for at least 5+ hours each time and I'm not quite halfway finished.This item would make a great gift as well!"
4,18-Feb-20,4,"Not the scent expected I somewhat expected a scent of vanilla in Sexy Man, but it mostly had AXE-like smell. Haven't lit it yet, but I'll update once I try it out.Tobacco Spice had more ""spice"" scent to it, so if you are not the ""spice"" type, it might not be the one you are looking for."
4,10-Nov-20,4,"Great candle! I received my candle yesterday, it's a bit smaller than expected. It burns really well, not too fast! The smell is wonderful, only a tiny amount too strong for my taste but I would definitely buy this to gift to someone for the holidays. overall, great purchase."
4,28-Dec-19,5,"Best scented candles on the market! As a self proclaimed scented candle addict, I must say the Lulu candles are some of the best I've come across in years. I've tried several including Espresso Bean, Sugared Pecans and Vanilla Oak - all wonderful, rich scents. The Espresso Bean is almost like brewing a fresh pot of coffee every time you light it and Sugared Pecans has been perfect for the holiday season. I recommend buying the smaller 6 oz. size which comes with a nice lid, helping to preserve the beautiful scent. Heavenly!"
4,13-Oct-20,5,"Best smelling candle I have ever purchased Hands down, this is the best-smelling candle I have ever bought. I purchased the Crumb Cake candle and I light it almost every single day. With that being said, it has lasted me several weeks with me lighting it very often and leaving it burning for several hours. The smell is SO great that when my boyfriend and his six-year-old son came home one day, his son said ""Is April baking a cake??"" I can't wait to buy the other scents too!"
4,5-May-19,5,"Great! Smells amazing. Have not burned it for a long enough duration to speak on longevity but the scent is wonderful, and the candle is aesthetically pleasing. I purchased this as a house warming gift for my boyfriend."
4,1-Feb-20,3,"Great smell but can explode This was a wonderful smelling candle that made the room smell great. It burns for long times and constantly smells good with each relight.One issue I encountered was after having the candle lit for an hour, the glass cracked and bottom exploded. Would repurchase for the smell, but not for the fire hazard."
4,23-Jun-20,5,Relaxing Candle with Good Scent Soy Candle- #16 Sexy Man is a slow burning candle with a 100% cotton wick produced by Lulu Candles. I was so glad that I got it right before a tornado-thunderstorm knocked down our power. We lit it and it not only provided light but it helped calm down our anxious dogs. The scent is subtle and this would be my only suggestion for improvement. Make it a little bit more fragrant.
4,3-Sep-20,2,Not great Nice candle but burns down really quick. Expensive for the length of time. Does smell good for a short while. Not recommended
4,7-Jul-20,5,Smells good enough to eat I got this gift for my mom for her birthday because we couldn't be together. It's basically a birthday cake without any of the calories ?üòÇ
4,27-May-20,2,Great scent but very poor burn Ive purchased Hundreds of candles-there is something about the wicks in these and the burn is terrible.  The wicks have a light smolder and burn poorly.The linen scent smells like dryer sheets.  Tobacco scent is great.
4,27-Jan-20,5,Great Coffee Smell This candle smells like being in a coffee shop! It fills the entire room with the smell of fresh coffee and I love it! I have had more compliments on the smell of this candle than with any other!
4,9-Aug-20,3,Not as good as Yankee candle .far to expensive for what you get The candle is ok but no where as good as Yankee candle the aroma sent doesn't last to long . Plus it would have been nicer set with a lid
4,9-Sep-20,5,Smells amazing! Absolutely LOVE my new candle :) I got the Espresso Bean scent because I love the smell of coffee especially in the mornings and oh is this amazing! Highly recommend! Want to check out if they have fall scents too like pumpkin latte or something! LOVE LULU CANDLES!
4,25-Aug-20,5,LOVE IT! This candle smells AMAZING. I am very particular about scents. I have never bought a candle I wasn‚Äôt able to smell beforehand. But pineapple is one of my favorite scents so I thought I‚Äôd try it since it‚Äôs hard to find paraffin-free candles in stores. And the candle is so cute!! I am definitely buying the bigger one next time!
4,24-Jul-20,5,"Smells greats, lasts forever! Love love love! Smells so good! I‚Äôd ordered the tobacco vanilla one before and it was wonderful! I branched our to the Moroccan lily this time and am glad I did! Smells fresh and light. Will definitely order again. So far, I haven‚Äôt ordered a scent I didn‚Äôt adore. These candles are also some of the longest lasting candles I‚Äôve found. Highly recommend!"
4,22-Feb-19,5,"My home smells like I'm in Starbucks! I purchased a few of these for my employees as a 'thank you' last month and they raved about them!  I then decided I needed one for myself.  It is the perfect size, burning right now - cleanly, and the scent is perfect.  My home really does smell like I just walked into Starbucks.  It's a great scent, a great candle, and I'll definitely purchase more scents.  It's a lovely gift and a lovely way to spoil oneself!"
4,27-Apr-20,5,"Pineapple Evergreen Smells Amazing! This candle smells amazing!! I ordered the Pineapple Evergreen scent. If you love ‚Äúfresh‚Äù smelling candles, you will enjoy this candle. I purchased this for myself during the quarantine because I love having a candle burning when I am home. Once I am through with this one, I would definitely try other scents.I can‚Äôt speak to how ‚Äúslow burning‚Äù it is because I have only had it lit for an hour or so."
4,18-Dec-19,5,"Smells delicious! This candle smells delicious, and I like the simplicity of the jar.  Very clean looking.  I mostly smell pineapple (not much evergreen) but that's perfectly fine with me."
4,31-Jul-20,5,"The best coffee/espresso candle that I have ever purchased! Packaging, design, longevity -- all great.  But the scent!  Oh, man, this is the very best coffee-scented candle that I have ever bought, and I have been through a lot.  I could smell it before I even opened the box: like walking into your favorite coffeehouse right after they have ground fresh beans.  So delicious.  Not only will I be buying this again, but I will be looking for a larger size.  I can not recommend this candle highly enough."
4,11-Aug-19,5,"Best Candles Ever! I freaking love these candles. The scents are awesome but not overpowering and they really are slow-burning; I'm always surprised by how long they're lasing. It took me much longer to go through the first one than I expected, and I've ordered a few more since. I even had a friend in town who loved the scent and ended up ordering some as a gift, so then I gifted some to her. Definitely recommend these if you want a good, slow-burning candle with a great scent."
4,21-Nov-19,5,"Smells great but... Love the scent! I wish the candles were larger. They are small so if you're gifting, be aware that they appear larger than they are. The size was disappointing."
4,29-Oct-19,5,"Aroma therapy you didn't know that you needed! I took the gamble of purchasing a candle online without ever smelling it before and it has been so worth it! I purchased the 9 oz. Vanilla Oak Soy Candle and it smells delicious. I've been using it so much, especially during the fall season and not only is the scent super comforting and cozy, the candle itself with the typewriter label is a must have. I highly recommend this candle for any occasion! Perfect for self-care, gifting to someone else, or just to have around the house."
4,11-Mar-20,5,"To die for scents These candles are amazing! This is the 3rd one I‚Äôve bought in a week. At first sight, you‚Äôd think the smell won‚Äôt be that strong but don‚Äôt be fooled. The scent fills a room and quickly at that. I wish they made them in 3 wick sizes because I‚Äôd stock up immediately."
4,21-Sep-20,5,"SMELLS SOOOOO GOOD. I got the blueberry candle, and its good, I already had the coffee and pineapple. All of the candles smells goods.I love, but I think its a little bit expensive for the size, but its a good candle. I loved it SO MUCH"
4,23-Mar-20,5,"If you are looking for a candle with a beautiful, natural scent, this is it! I bought the two pack of candles in the scent Amber Rose & Sheer Musk, and it smelled amazing right out of the package! The packaging is minimalist, sleek, and compliments any decor. I love how understated it is. The price of the quality is honestly worth every penny. Don't buy candles from big brand names, shop with Lulu! This is my first time buying, and I'm looking forward to trying the other scents."
4,4-May-19,5,"In love with linen Gave this as a gift. Smells lovely and burns evenly. It does seem pretty small, but the scent is so strong you don‚Äôt need it to be much bigger!! The person I gifted it to Loves it and began burning it already. It melts Pretty slow so I‚Äôm sure it will Last a while!"
4,28-Dec-19,5,Amber sheer musk I keep reordering the Amber sheer musk I love how light but still effective that fragrance is I do however wish the burning time for the candles were longer but still a great buy for the price.
4,3-Aug-20,5,Small but so worth it!! I love this candle. I purchased lemon grass scent. It‚Äôs so fresh! Burns slowly and evenly! I will definitely be ordering more‚ù§Ô?è
4,28-Aug-20,5,Yummy Super yummy and so fresh ! Smells  like fresh cut fruit all through the house . Definitely will order a bigger size next time
4,12-Mar-20,5,Love it Smells good! I wanted a vanilla candle and a lemon candle and I found this instead. It smells nice and it looks kinda like a designer candle because it‚Äôs black and white.
4,30-Nov-19,5,Great scents and Lasts forever! I've bought 5 of these over time. The candles burn clean and are very noticable but not overpowering. The fresh linen and Midnight in Paris are my favorites.
4,30-Oct-20,4,Stinks So I purchased the Mary Jane cannabis infused  assuming it smelled like weed. Nope... not even close. It smells like a spicy old man. The candle is very good quality. Nice jar.
4,2-Jan-20,5,"Great Candle for Gift I can‚Äôt vouch for burning this candle as I bought it for a gift, but it is visually appealing and the smell! Oh my gosh! SO GOOD. Everyone loved it."
4,18-Sep-20,5,"Smell wonderful and last long Loved to natural scent of this candle. I gave 5 stars, because I knew how small the candle would be, even though I wished it was larger or priced lower. Very happy with quality."
4,24-Nov-20,5,"Perfect Size and Love the Smell The 6 ounce candle is the perfect size for a small table or room.  The wick and wax burn evenly and last longer than expected.  I have purchased several candles with similar smell descriptions, but none have come as close as this one.  Love it and would recommend to anyone looking for a small candle with fresh linen scent"
4,6-May-19,1,Not a good scent Horrible smell too much work to send back not worth the money
4,20-Feb-20,5,Excellent and lovely candle It is a beautiful gift idea.  My daughter loved it and the scent is real nice too.  The packaging is done nicely .  I would buy again.  Not to mention my grand daughter name us lulu. Thanks
4,30-Jun-20,5,OMG this candle smells soooo good!!! i ordered it for my best friend birthday and that was the first thing she said when she called me and said. once i got there  i smelled it and ordered me one as well!!!
4,7-Apr-20,5,"Winning candle! I never buy candles without having smelled them before, but coronavirus has changed things up on me. This candle is incredible! It smells likeHeaven and has filled my house! I would buy it again, and again, and again. Great purchase!"
4,29-Jul-20,5,"Pineapple Evergreen- amazing smell, long lasting I wasn't expecting this candle to smell as strong as it does! It fills my room with the sweet smell of pineapple within 10 minutes and the smell lingers for an hour or two after I put it out. this is probably one of my favorite smelling candles I've ever purchased. It was a bit smaller than I expected, however, I've had it for a week and burn it everyday and it's not even halfway gone! I will definitely be purchasing this candle again!"
4,29-Dec-19,4,"Love the scent The scent, which is arguably the most important thing, is A+.  The throw is great as well, the smell remains even the day after in my room, which is perfect because I needed some candles to make my room smell better. I chose to buy this over the pf candle tobacco and vanilla. All I can say is that this candle is indeed slow burning and has a strong scent. Perfect cozy scent for winter time"
4,21-Aug-20,5,"Long lasting, wish I could test smell before buying Wasn‚Äôt a fan of the blueberry but got the wild lemon grass and it smells great and lasts forever!  Wish I could smell before I buy..."
4,16-Nov-20,5,"Perfect-size tin with a rubber-enclosed lid This is a perfectly sized candle that you are able to hold within your palm, I picked the No.5 Fresh Linen, it has a relatively mild scent to keep you calm. It lasts for a quite a while compared to other candles that I have used before. I love the design with the rubber-enclosed lid, it makes it super easy to seal and open. Looking forward to trying different scents!"
4,7-Sep-20,5,"Aesthetic & Long-Lasting! I always have trouble finding candles that are earthy and more natural scented, which is why I am so happy I found Lulu Candles! The candles are long lasting and not overpowering at all. Some of the candles even give back, like the Furr a cause lavender candle which donates to rescuing abandoned animals."
4,26-Jul-20,5,"Super Scented I love this candle. It makes my house smell wonderful. Wish they were slightly larger, but it's a small price to pay for such a great scent. Buy with confidence."
4,5-Aug-20,4,"Pleasantly surprised! I ordered the Pineapple Evergreen scent because it had so many positive reviews, despite my hesitancy because it just sounded like an odd scent combo. I‚Äôm happy to report that I am very pleasantly surprised! Somehow the 2 scents work really well together! I haven‚Äôt had a chance to burn it for longer than just a couple of hours, but so far no complaints except for how small the actual candle is."
4,17-Sep-20,5,"Great smell throw, looks nice too The Amber Rose Sheer Musk is going to be part of my regular rotation. I love amber and this one is amber-forward. I use it for home yoga and mediation sessions and it changes the whole vibe into something special. The pared-back design of the label also looks nice in any room in the house."
4,12-Nov-20,5,"Intoxicating The scent of the Vanilla Oak candle has flooded my nasal passages with magic for several hours now, and I've barely scratched the surface. It might last 9000 hours. Perhaps it's eternal. I can smell it right now as I type this. The aroma is so utterly delightful that I think my synapses are overheating and maybe I'm about to pass ou"
4,8-Jun-20,5,Great Candle! This candle lasts a really long time and has such a great scent.  The one candle makes my whole downstairs area smell fresh and clean.  Highly recommend!
4,31-Oct-20,5,"Crumb Cake Smells Delish... Literally like food/sugar. I haven't lit it yet...so i don't know how well it burns, how well the aroma disperses or how long it lasts. But so far so good! Great recommendation."
4,11-Mar-19,4,Amber Musk is Girly This scent is nice but not my favorite of this brand. It needs to be on a fabulous dressing table of a very glamorous lady. Rather strong but not too much.
4,14-May-20,5,Amazing Oh my goodness I could smell it before I got the box open. It smells wonderful. I am currently burning it and it is my new fave candle. I got the pineapple evergreen.
4,17-Mar-20,3,smaller than expected - won't last me through this quarantine but it's cute The candle is so much smaller than I originally expected. It's a cute candle but I don't think it's worth it based on the price. I definitely enjoy the scents even though they're hard to smell at first.
4,24-Jul-20,5,A non-toxic candle that if affordable and delish! I have been searching for a non-toxic candle that is affordable and smells like being in the mountains! It burns clean and I love that the design is minimalistic so it matches with most decor. I am obsessed Juniper Leaf scent and even though it‚Äôs a holiday scent I burn it all year long!
4,19-Jul-20,5,"A great all over the house scent! Truly a slow burning candle! I wasn‚Äôt so fond of the scent before it was lit, but as it warmed up, it fulfilled my wish for laundry day nostalgia."
4,27-May-20,5,"Great scent and long-lasting This was my first time purchasing LuLu Candles, and it's my new favorite!  I chose the Wild Lemongrass scent, and it smells so refreshing. This is a perfect spring scent.  It's long-lasting too, which makes it worth the price."
4,24-Sep-19,5,"Best candle I've ever purchased. Entire experience was worthy of five stars.  It arrived a day earlier that expected.  High Quality & Smells Great!!  If you're looking for a candle, your search can stop here."
4,11-Nov-20,3,"Small and expensive + dishonest review system Good smell, but very small for the price. They offer a free candle for a good review so that would explain the glowing reviews. If you have extra money to spend go for it, but glade candles are 7x cheaper and comparable in quality."
4,20-Sep-20,5,"Sweet, cozy & delish I mean, this candle. My husband and I discovered it while at a steakhouse. We both used the restrooms and came out and both exclaimed something to the extent of ‚Äúthis is weird, but that bathroom smelled INCREDIBLE‚Äù. 1 bottle of wine and an Amazon ‚Äú1 click buy‚Äù this baby was on our doorstep 3 days later. It‚Äôs pine-y and cozy but also sweet and yummy... so so good!"
4,1-Apr-20,1,Wick is poorly made. Don‚Äôt buy! This was a disappointing purchase. Save your money. The wick was poorly made and disappeared into the wax. I kept having to scoop up the wax to pull out the wick and lost a lot of wax. For the price and the poor quality I wouldn‚Äôt recommend. I wish I could get a refund.
4,9-Jun-20,5,"Good presentation I decided to give it a try for the good reviews I read, just received it today though but lid it for a while and the scent doesn‚Äôt last."
4,25-Aug-20,5,"Smells so good! I purchased this candle in the scent espresso bean. I have been searching for a coffee scented candle that actually makes the room smell and I've found it! I've only burned it a few times so we'll see how long it lasts me, but scent wise it is so nice. The packaging is also very simple and I would gift this to someone. Also, soy candles are a perk, much better for the environment"
4,18-Sep-19,5,"For Candle lovers! Bought this as a gift, my niece and her fianc?© love candles and this one smells like a vanilla birthday cake!  I‚Äôm sensitive to scents and this one isn‚Äôt overwhelming."
4,4-Jun-20,5,Smells amazing! I'm very impressed with lulu candles!  They smell amazing and take a long time to burn.  In my opinion they are much better than Yankee Candles and other brands I've tried.  I will definitely buy more.
4,13-Apr-20,5,"Quality Candle in Classic Packaging I bought this for my son's dorm room - it is not a typically feminine candle and the packaging is sleek and classic, not calling attention to itself. The fragrance is clean and fresh - possibly the best candle fragrance we have tried and we have tried many!  We have now made our second purchase of this candle and will be looking to purchase as gifts as well.  You will not be disappointed with this choice!"
4,13-May-20,5,"Must have all year around.?üôè?üèª This product by far is the best candle smell quality I bought so far.  Once it is lit smells spread all over and beyond.  Smells clean and relaxing. Even when I blew off the candle and leave the lid open, the smell remains in the air.  It is worth the pay and will purchase it again in the near future ."
4,8-Jun-20,5,Beautiful Candle This is a beautiful candle. The scent is really fresh.  My whole apartment smells great while and after using it. Lasts long too.
4,23-Feb-20,5,"Smells sexy The scent is so good! It smells of light cologne, very sexy, it's not a big candle but it does burn slow. I'm highly satisfied and would definitely buy again"
4,24-May-20,5,"Sets The Mood! Love this candle and everything it stands for...& the company ethos does not disappoint! It burns long and clean (without any billowy dark smoke), and the smell is gorgeous without being overbearing. It adds to the vibe of my space and helps inspire in the AM with my coffee or unwind in the evening with a glass of wine. I would recommend the experience, and I can't wait to try other, earthy fragrances! Thank you Lulu Candles!"
4,23-Nov-20,5,"My wife liked it, need I say more? Loved that my wife found it pleasing, and after all, isn't that what marriage is all about?  Very pleasing scent, although she burned it up on the first or second day she confiscated it from my room, but hey, it is what it is right?I guess I will order another one for myself...."
4,1-Apr-20,4,Love love love Love these candles... Purchased blueberry cobbler and sandalwood and absolutely love them. Just not a fan of this smell
4,25-Jan-20,5,"Perfect little candle Loved this candle. I have candles in apple cinnamon and pineapple evergreen. I enjoyed pineapple- It had a little bit of a stronger scent when burning. Not overboard, but it filled the main part of my house very pleasantly. Apple and cinnamon have always been favorite scents of mine, and it was still nice (don‚Äôt get me wrong) but I just can‚Äôt get enough of the pineapple evergreen!  Try one. You will enjoy it!"
4,5-May-20,5,"New Favorite Candle! Was looking for a candle with long burn time and strong scent - this is my new favorite candle! Previously was obsessed with Diptyque candles, but the cost is way too high for the rate I burn through them. These Lulu candles smell just as great, long almost just as long, and are only a quarter of the price! Definitely will be purchasing again."
4,18-Oct-20,5,"These candles are awesome The tobacco spice & vanilla candle smells amazing!! Good throw, cute packaging, definitely giftable. Way better than a Yankee candle. No harmful chemicals and a cotton wick. Love everything about this candle!"
4,28-Dec-18,5,"The Lemongrass smell is amazing!!! This candle was a present to my sister, and she loved it! The smell is not too overwhelming, but also not a cloyingly sweet smell. It has a very refreshing smell that cleanses your palate. She was very happy to receive it. I also really like how it is a soy candle -- it burns longer! Even though it is a small size, that doesn't mean it won't burn for longer."
4,3-Dec-19,5,"Bought four, love them! I purchased two of the apple cinnamon (for the holidays), a blueberry, and a lemongrass. All of these candles smell so good and I love that they're soy and not full of too many chemicals like a lot of other nice/strong smelling candles on the market. I wish they were a bit bigger, but I can't complain because of the quality and reasonable price!Will buy again!"
4,29-Oct-20,5,"2nd candle purchased from Lulu Lulu Candles are the best. This is the second candle purchased from them and both have been great. I still have a bit left in the first candle that I bought months ago. I was waiting for it to finish, but it seems like that won't happen anytime soon so I bought a new scent the other day. It arrived and smells great. I will definitely continue to get Lulu Candles in the future."
4,11-Aug-20,3,Don't buy during summer months!! My fault for not thinking it's hot outside but my candle came melted and ruined. It spilled put into the box so it was a mess?üòÇ maybe a cover for the candle would be a good idea? It smelled really good though and the box was super cute!
4,6-Jul-20,4,"It's warm and inviting. Makes the house feel cozy and comfortable! The scent is fabulous! I do wish it was a little larger for the price but with that scent, I am very happy with it and I would absolutely gift it to someone if I could part with it. Next time I must order two so I can share! I can't wait to try other scents. I WISH we could pick three and get a discount for buying in a ""pack."""
4,27-Oct-20,5,"Good candle Received good feedback from the person that I gifted it to.  She liked the smell and said it burned for a nice, long time."
4,9-May-20,5,At last a candle that stands up to it description! I had a hard time selecting which scent but after reading reviews I decided on No.29 - Cedarwood Infused Mango.  I couldn't wait to see what this combination would be like. It was everything I thought it would.  The fragrance is over the top; a great blend but each scent stands alone in a good way. Each compliments the other. This is my first time ordering a LuLu candle and it won't be my last!
4,14-May-20,5,My house smells like coffee I have tried other coffee scented candles and none of them compared to this candle.  The smell is fantastic.
4,9-Oct-20,5,"Great scent that carries I colleague recently recommended Lulu candles to me and I decided to give them a try. I received this candle earlier this morning and love it. First off, the scent is amazing. But second, and most important of all, the scent carries when the candle is lit. I have a very large living room. I've been burning the candle all morning and my whole living room smells amazing. So to sum up, love and definitely recommend!"
4,9-Aug-20,5,Long lasting & smells like fresh brewed coffee Wow! I absolutely love this amazing candle! I‚Äôve been looking for this exact scent! It smells like freshly brewed coffee in the morning! Mmmmm smells like heaven on earth! I highly recommend ?üòä
4,26-May-20,2,"Bad batch?!? We have been loyal Lulu Candle customers, we love these candles...they always smell great and burn slow...we love them.  However, I just got 2 more of one of my fav scents, Tobacco spice & vanilla and both of these candles are tunneling so bad!  I let them both burn for 4+ hours on 1st light...but these 2 just aren't burning like usual.  Bummed, not sure if the formula has changed or maybe a wick change?  Or maybe I just got a bad batch, IDK!"
4,4-Nov-20,5,"Fantastic and affordable candle This definitely won't be the last time I buy this candle. It's always a gambling purchasing a candle online when you can't smell it, but I found the descriptors on this candle to be super accurate. A very pleasing scent that isn't overwhelming. Happy to have this candle be a part of my home! I just wish it could last longer! The container is also minimal and fits well into minimalistic spaces."
4,13-Aug-20,5,"The perfect fresh laundry scent we all crave never written a review before! BUT WOW! Love this candle, it is very strong smelling, but when you burn it, it gently fills the room with the perfect scent of fresh linens. It's wonderful! As far as I can tell, it is long lasting, I think I bought it about a month ago, and it is just above halfway mark...and I light scented candles RELIGIOUSLY. Thank you LULU candles!! Definitely a fair price for a fair candle:)"
4,29-May-19,5,"Best candle ever I have bought a lot of scented candles in my life time, These are definitely the healthiest and best smelling candles I‚Äôve ever used the blueberry cobbler is sick smells just like a blueberry pie!!!"
4,20-Feb-19,5,"Great Scent Amber is one of my favorite scents. I‚Äôve never had it combined with rose, but this candle smells wonderful. It‚Äôs not too sweet or floral. I prefer warmer scents and this one is a good fit and it came well packaged!"
4,4-Jan-20,5,"Smells great and great gift, for some special or yourself! Arrived well packaged to avoid any breakage and smells great. In fact you don‚Äôt even need to light it to enjoy the scent. Once you do light it, it fills the entire home with the scent."
4,28-Aug-20,5,"Smells so yummy! Just like a cappuccino! This is my second purchase from LuLu Candles, and their scents do NOT disappoint. The scent of this candle is so rich & decadent, & I love the simplistic design of the jar. Fits in with any aesthetic. Shipping was fast, and the item was packaged well. I can‚Äôt wait to smell the other scents from this brand. It even lingers well after you blow out the candle."
4,7-Aug-20,3,Can‚Äôt really smell anything when it‚Äôs lit Okay so I bought the sexy man candle and smells great! But when it‚Äôs lit you can barely smell anything!! Also it‚Äôs very small for the amount you pay.
4,29-Apr-19,5,"good service Pineapple Evergreen is a very soothing, natural scent that leans slightly more to pineapple side. I just received it today, so can't comment on longevity, but it's burning evenly and slowly. Love it!"
4,17-Nov-18,5,Absolutely love this candle This is by far the best scented candle I have ever gotten such a clean fragrance and slow burning was going to give it as a gift but I am going to keep it for me
4,12-Jun-20,5,"Long lasting with a great scent. Just like the other reviews state, this is a long-lasting candle, slow to burn. I bought the Wild Lemongrass but I'll be checking out some of the others. Best of all, this candle burns evenly - no high walls of wax on the side of the glass.Very happy with this purchase!"
4,20-May-20,5,"Does not masks smells! Destroys them ?üò? I love this candle because I had to deep clean my carpet because the previous owner had a dog that clearly wasn‚Äôt cleaned often. After, there was still a lingering smell of dog and this candle diminished that smell. Now my apartment smells like lemon vanilla goodness! Also, it‚Äôs soy so it doesn‚Äôt leave that soot crap everywhere or your sinuses! Clean burn!"
4,17-Aug-20,5,BEST. SCENT. EVER. This candle is the perfect blend of my aesthetics wrapped into one candle. I don‚Äôt know how else to describe this amazing scent but my god it‚Äôs pure bliss
4,20-Nov-20,5,Fantastic Candles This was my first time purchasing LuLu Candles and I was not disappointed. I chose this particular candle for the advertised scent and I was pleased to find that the robust and pronounced smell that omitted from the candle (lit or unlit) smelt natural and amazing. I loved the glass holder it came in as well with a nice design and font. I am currently purchasing my next two candles from them!
4,18-Mar-20,5,"All around beautiful candle that's safe for you! I'm a big candle lover and am constantly on the search for one that smells good, burns for a long time and is safe (soy with a cotton wick).  This one satisfies all of those things!  I've tried two scents so far (Fresh linen and Lemon & Vanilla Bean) and both fill the room with a nice smell without being being overwhelming.  I found my new favorite candle and would highly recommend it for you or as a gift!"
4,20-Jun-19,5,Great Quality This brand of candles is superior on every level. There's not a bad fragrance in the line up. Buy with confidence that you'll get a great smelling long lasting candle for a fair price.
4,14-Jul-20,3,"Nice scent but poor longevity The scent was great but the longevity of this candle is very poor. I like to leave my candles going all day so to start this candle on a Sunday and it be finished by Wednesday is a no for me. If you let yours go for a little often or here and there then go for it, but for me the price just wasn‚Äôt worth it."
4,8-Nov-18,5,Great scent and quality I bought a Lulu Wild Lemongrass candle for the first time and am impressed by the tempered yet straightforward scent and even burn. I make my own candles but was away from home and wanted a candle that could help with indoor mosquitoes. I will order from Lulu again to try another scent -- I like their handmade approach and the candles are fairly priced.
4,29-May-20,4,"Clean scent I am extremely particular about candles and scents. I've definitely never purchased a new candle online before, but with the pandemic didn't have many options. This got good reviews so I am giving it a try. Bought the lemongarass scent. So far only have burned one time. Love the scent. It's perfect for summer and is very clean/ not overbearing. I would give it five stars, except it isn't a particularly large candle. I love a super steal!"
4,14-Mar-20,4,"As advertised... I'm a dude who spends a lot of time in an office. Sometimes I eat. Sometimes I brew coffee. Sometimes I fart. And when I know someone is coming by, it's nice to have a not-so-feminine smelling candle to light and make it a more inviting environment for my visitors and colleagues.It's not an overpowering aroma, and it smells nice. I'd recommend Lulu Candles for your home and/or office!"
4,15-Sep-20,5,Love these scents - use a candle warmer to last longer!! Highly recommend!! I got the tobacco and spice scent as well as the sexy man scent and love both. Highly recommend using the 6oz candles on a candle warmer!!! They literally last 100x longer than if you burn them regularly ‚Äî I‚Äôve had the tobacco and spice candle for months and use it on the candle warmer and it still produces a very nice and strong scent.
4,6-Jun-20,4,"Nice to buy The scent is nice and fill your room with an uplifting sense. Lemon and vanilla is fresh and frutiy, but not too sweet that chokes you. Amber rose makes you feel like you‚Äôre in a spa centre, very relaxing. My favourite is jasmine and lily that makes me feel like in a botanical garden. However tunnelling is a problem that it cannot get an even surface after 3.5 hours of burning. Design is also modern and burn slowly"
4,3-Jun-20,5,"It smells amazing and burns for a while! I really love the smell of the Pineapple Evergreen, I have a dog in my studio and I really wanted a scent that would neutralize any odor and this candle has done the job! it always smells fresh and it actually burns for a long time too!"
4,19-Nov-19,5,Best smelling candle ever! I gave this to a friend for her birthday - absolutely wonderful smell.  Forget bath and body works - this is an original gift which supports small business.
4,16-Jun-20,5,"Long Lasting Smells great I bought the 9oz candle in the Ocean Breeze scent and i really love it. It came well packaged and although it‚Äôs not the usual big candle it‚Äôs probably about the size of the glade ones if not a little bigger! Also i have noticed it burns a lot slower which means it‚Äôll last long but the scent for me is noticeable even the following day or two! I really like it, would buy again"
4,10-Jan-20,5,"Beautiful look and smell I love the way these are made and they look and smell beautiful! I am giving them as gifts, so I haven‚Äôt lit them, but I know my friends will love them!"
4,22-May-20,5,Mmm laundry smell good The candle is cute and the smell isn‚Äôt overly artificial. Soy candles are wonderful because they burn clean and tend to melt a little faster than traditional candles. It would make a great gift to anyone who loves the smell of laundry.
4,4-Apr-20,5,"Top notch candle I don‚Äôt usually buy my candles without testing the smell first but I took a chance ordering the pineapple evergreen and I‚Äôm so pleased that I did. The scent is so reminiscent of being in Hawaii, the pineapple is vibrant and fresh, very much like slicing open a juicy pineapple and that hint of evergreen is such a nice combination. I love this candle and so far it seems to be a nice long burning one."
4,19-Jul-20,5,"So great! I love this little candle so much! I have been looking for a tobacco scented candle for MONTHS and haven‚Äôt been able to find one that wasn‚Äôt outrageously expensive. This Tobacco Spice and Vanilla is everything I hoped it would be and more! The warm, slightly sweet notes are cozy and comforting. I just bought it but can tell I will definitely reorder and also try other scents as well!"
4,24-Jan-19,2,"Decent The wick is cheap and makes a mess in candle. If you want for scent only, it‚Äôs great. If for looks too, not a good buy"
4,13-Nov-20,5,"The Espresso Bean scent smells AMAZING! I purchased the 6oz Espresso Bean candle, and absolutely love the scent! It‚Äôs rich, and smells exactly like fresh beans. The candle itself is stylish and minimalist - it would make a great gift or stocking stuffer for the coffee lover in your life. I will definitely be purchasing the 9oz candle when the 6oz is finished."
4,24-Nov-20,4,"Great coffee scent! Smells so good, nice simple packaging. Wish the smell was a bit stronger, but stiil very worth the price!"
4,14-Sep-20,5,"Beautiful candle, delightful scent! Would be great in a small room or as a gift. I first encountered the Lulu candles in a restroom at a nice restaurant. I couldn't get over how nice the smell was, and came home and ordered a couple. The smell is just delightful, and the compact and simple branding of the candle would make this just a terrific gift as well as a welcome addition to your own home! They're definitely worth the price, and I love supporting a US company."
4,20-Jul-19,1,"Smells like Blue Magic hair grease Didn't enjoy this smell at all. It was very weak and reminded me of hair grease. General invocation of moods and memories I didn't want to have, all created by this annoying scent.Can't wait to return."
4,24-Oct-19,5,Lulu candles We love these Luxury Soy Candels in all the scents.  We have them in every bathroom and the Kitchen.  The cook is always cooking and the candles help neutralize the smells.  Thanks for make a great item.
4,16-Apr-20,5,Love this candle! I LOVE this candle and already know I‚Äôll be purchasing more. I got the Sugared Pecans scent and it‚Äôs deliciously smelling without being overwhelming. What I love most is the neutral color and label. It allows me to put it in any room of my home without clashing with my other decor or being a distracting eyesore. It‚Äôs a great size and would make a cute gift!
4,26-Sep-20,5,"Strong enough not overpowering I have tried the lavender and the pineapple evergreen scent, & I can‚Äôt wait to try others. The scent isn‚Äôt overpowering but gives enough to fill our small bathroom without even being lit! I accidentally ordered 3 last time, & I‚Äôm not even sending them back because I know I‚Äôll be glad to have them to gift or use myself."
4,5-Nov-20,4,A bit pricey but great scent This candle seems a bit small for the price but I am new to the candle market. I really like the smell of this candle and look forward to lighting it often. The labeling and design are great and this is absolutely a gift able product. All signs good so far but it seems small for the price.
4,25-Mar-20,5,"Great scent Someone gave me the birthday one as a gift. I fell in love with it. I was going to buy another one of the same kind, but at the last minute decided to try a different scent. I love this one too. My home smells like a coffee shop."
4,3-Oct-20,5,"LOVE this candle! I needed a candle, but was hesitant to buy a candle on line - never sure I am  going to like the scent.  I decided to give it a shot, and am so glad that I did.  Even my husband likes the scent, and he dislikes scents.  Beyond the scent, i like the black candle holder and the box it came in is beautiful if you are giving as a gift.  Quality all around.  Will surely order again.  Gifting season is coming!"
4,8-Jan-20,5,"Smells Amazing! I love this candle. I purchased the Jasmine and Sandalwood candle and it smells amazing! I would buy this candle as a gift for people who love candles, like me. ?üòâI will be buying additional scents to try seasonally."
4,20-May-20,5,"Love the scents of Lulu candles I love these Lulu candles! Expresso Bean scent is my favorite.  I have purchased many of them. The scent is very aromic, but certainly not overbearing. I only wish the Expresso Bean came in a large size.  The candle size is very small and I feel I have to burn it sparingly as a treat. This candle scent is fabulous!"
4,8-May-19,5,"Smells so good even unlit! I love the smell of this candle! I‚Äôll have it out, unlit even, and you can still smell the comforting scent of the perfect amount of the aroma from all around the house. I also got the blueberry cobbler one and my friend asked what smelled so amazing & said she could smell it from walking through the front door. Our house is 2200 sq ft and we have pets so I am so pleased with these candles! I need some bigger sizes! I‚Äôm very picky when it comes to the authenticity of what‚Äôs being advertised, and these candles have blown me away."
4,4-Apr-20,4,Didn‚Äôt burn all the way down I love the smell and the fact that it‚Äôs soy for clean burning but the candle reached the end of its life with 1/4 of the candle left which was really disappointing.
4,14-Mar-19,5,"Pleasantly Surprised 1) So fresh smelling, great quality. Never would have thought pineapple + evergreen would be a good scent, but I am in love with this candle!!! The scents surprisingly complement each other and the aroma is not too strong or artificial smelling.2)Scent travels well from room to room. Don't let the fact that this comes as a 6oz candle deter you.... it has filled my home with this delightful scent. Even without lighting this candle, it makes my whole living room smell lovely.  Worth every penny; will definitely buy more!"
4,16-Aug-19,5,"A candle that smells good and is high quality I like how this candle (pineapple evergreen scent) had a great scent and seems to be great quality. I'm getting another one delivered tomorrow, too (espresso bean scent)."
4,16-Sep-19,2,Way too small. Lasts 2-3 days (assuming u had it lit all day) When I got it I was surprised by how small it was. Then I lit the candle and had it lit for the entire day (8 hours or so) and half was gone . Second picture is after one day
4,27-Jul-20,5,Love the scent Love the scent but wish they were available in a larger size because they burn quick. A little on the expensive side.
4,12-Jun-20,5,"Mmmm!! The BEST smelling coffee candle. I‚Äôve never tried lulu candles, but I‚Äôve seen them at my friends houses so I decided to give it a try. The scent is absolutely perfect! Not too heavy, and not fake smelling. I will be buying more scents for sure!"
4,25-Aug-20,5,Great Things come is Small packages! This small candle carries a big punch in its wonderful scent! The fragrance is subtle yet elegant and irresistible.
4,7-Aug-20,5,Smells amazing! I was looking for a light summer scent and this candle is exactly what I was looking for! It smells amazing. We have been burning it all day since it arrived!
4,1-Jun-20,5,"Strong This is the third double pack of pineapple evergreen candles I have purchased. Out of all the candles I own, this is my all time favorite. For a 9 ounce candle, the scent is amazing, and it lasts quite a long time. It smells up my entire home which is awesome! My only request is you make this in a larger jar, and sell it as a double pack so it‚Äôs even more cost effective for someone like me who will continue to purchase them!"
4,3-Jul-20,5,Perfect packaging and simply sweet smelling candle! I ordered this candle for my daughter's 17th birthday! The box the candle is in is perfect for gifting. The scent is exactly what you imagine a Buttercream frosted cupcake would smell like! She was very happy with it! I will order candles from this company again!
4,18-Nov-20,4,Good Gift This candle made such a good gift. It smelt so nice and looks so cute i wanted to keep it for myself.
4,25-Jun-20,5,"Exactly what I was looking for I was like for a quality, handcrafted American made candle and that is what this is. You can smell the scent as soon as you open it but it isn't too overbearing when you light it. It burns slow and is a nice modern touch to our decor, I love the simplicity of the packaging. I'm not sure if it is supposed to have a lid but ours did not come with one. Either way, I'll be ordering more and foresee this being my go-to brand."
4,4-Oct-20,5,"I just love Lulu candles They are wonderful candles......They burn clean and they smell beautiful..,,,,And, I love the ‚Äúfur a cause‚Äù candles that donate proceeds to help the poor animals who so need help too......."
4,7-Apr-19,5,"Fragrant, clean burning candle. Great smelling candle.  Very strong.  I would compare the quality to a Aveda candle. It‚Äôs strong smelling but not suffocating like some of the brands like Yankee. I think they smell so fake and make the air thick. These candles smell fresh and really fill the room up with fragrance.  I always think good candles are on the pricey side - not sure why I have to spend 20$ to get a decent candle, but it‚Äôs worth it. Better than buying a bunch of cheap ones that aren‚Äôt as good."
4,9-Sep-20,5,"This is the real deal! Just Awesome, I've been trying different soy candles on Amazon and these folks know what they are doing. Perfect scent and last for a long time. My favorite is either the lavender musk or sexy man."
4,3-Mar-19,4,Great Mix The Evergreen scent gives the Pineapple some depth and keeps it from being overly sweet - great fragrance! Could be a little stronger but otherwise great.  Also pay attention to the size of the candle as it was a bit smaller than I expected but I'm sure that information was there for me to see prior to purchase.  I would purchase again.
4,31-Mar-20,4,Smells amazing ! I love the scent of lavender and was looking for a fragrant candle that embodied fresh lavender. This candle adds in a musky scent along with the lavender making it a very pleasant scent. It‚Äôs strong enough to make my living room smell nice but not over powering. Would give 5 stars but it‚Äôs kind of small for the price point.
4,6-Jun-20,5,just right smells just like nag champa! small candle with just the right amount of scent. cute design. long lasting fragrance! will buy again.
4,1-Nov-18,5,"Smells wonderful! This is a really lovely scent! Fresh, juicy and delightful pineapple scent, but the pine gives it some depth and complexity and keeps it from being too sweet. It smells really nice just sitting in the bathroom, not lit. I love it."
4,22-Aug-20,4,Came with no lid smells nice. (Ocean breeze) would've been nice to have a lid especially since the candle is white.
4,13-Nov-20,5,Fantastic! This candle is intoxicating.  It fills the room with one of my favorite scents.  I LOVE this candle!
4,17-Aug-20,5,Awesome smell! Great gift! Smells amazing!!!!! Great gift! It smells like Birthday cake and since I can‚Äôt be there to celebrate it does the trick!!!!
4,27-Jul-20,4,"Great scent, long-lasting Love the scent, slow burning albeit a small candle, definitely will last a while. Only downsides are the warning label on the back (for such a small candle, would be preferable to put this on the bottom), and it doesn‚Äôt seem to burn perfectly even. Not super uneven. Would still highly recommend!"
4,14-Oct-20,5,Great scent Product arrived in a timely fashion and the scent is amazing. Buying candles online leaves the customer hoping for a good scent and Lulu has come through on this one.
4,4-Feb-19,5,Smells Amazing-Even when not burning! I'm trying to make the switch from toxic paraffin wax candles vs healthy plant based soy candles and I'm thrilled with this find. I first ordered a 6 oz Wild Lemongrass candle and loved it so I ordered a second 9 oz Blueberry Cobbler and I love them both!! I will be ordering more soy candles from this company in the very near future. Cannot recommend enough!! One thing I would like to add - I wish the 9 oz candles were offered at a bigger discount vs the smaller 6 oz ones ... that would make more sense to be cheaper the bigger the candle!! More bang for your buck :)
4,23-Jan-20,5,Good Buy Not really much of a candle guy but I figured I'd try one and I like the price/quality. I usually light them by my bedside to ... you know ... set the mood. I actually went through four of them so quickly that I ordered another 4. Not sure if that's because the candles are burning fast or because I'm having to many women over.
4,25-Nov-20,5,"Smells amazing! I ordered a two pack of the lemon vanilla candles to give as gifts this holiday season. So I can‚Äôt fully describe how they smell when they‚Äôre lit, but the smell emitting from them not lit is amazing!!  Excited to gift these to 2 special friends."
4,3-Aug-20,5,"Bought as retirement gift Bought as a retirement gift and had it sent directly to them, but I‚Äôd like to think it was 5 star worthy."
4,22-May-20,5,"Great candle, great price! Absolutely amazing scent - smells like vanilla espresso. I also love the design - the candle gives off a warm glow - perfect for the first thing in the morning when making coffee, so the whole apartment smells like it!I haven‚Äôt had any issues with glass shattering like other reviews."
4,3-Oct-20,1,"Don't purchase unless you know what this exact candle smells like. I didn't like the smell.  I won't be buying candles online unless they have the product that I actually was looking for or, if I can smell them before buying.  I don't even light it anymore - can't tolerate the smell.  Not for me."
4,20-Jul-20,4,"Smells great, not long lasting This didn‚Äôt last nearly as long as a lot of soy candles I‚Äôve purchased before, but the scent is very strong and pleasant!"
4,4-Mar-20,5,"Lots of Fragrance! For those who have been disappointed by candles that advertised scent and did not deliver, this is the candle for you! Very fragrant and long-lasting. I purchased the Linen scent and it has a very strong linen fragrance. It can be overpowering in small spaces, but if you have a large room you wish to scent, this one will deliver."
4,10-Nov-20,4,"Subtle smell, good burn time I wanted to try a Soy candle so after looking at several, I bought the Fresh Linen fragrance candle. Fairly small for the price but the burn time seems to be fairly slow which is good. The fragrance is nice and very subtle, it doesn't overpower the room . Overall I am pleased with the product and would purchase different scents."
4,22-Apr-19,5,"Best Candles ever Honestly the best candles I‚Äôve ever bought. They‚Äôre highly scented, last a long time, and the scents are so unique and smell so wonderful. They‚Äôre also aesthetically pleasing as work as little accessories to any room! I‚Äôve bought 3 so far, the jasmine/apple one, the pineapple evergreen, and the jasmine infused bergamot, each one super unique but smell soo good."
4,7-Aug-20,5,Smells amazing Smells absolutely amazing. Sou candles are the way to go for health reasons and this company is putting out top quality products
4,14-Aug-20,4,Great smell but wick is too short I love the scent of these candles BUT the wick never goes down all the way and there‚Äôs always so much wax left! This candle has at least a quarter of its wax left but the wick won‚Äôt light anymore. This has happened many times with this product and I‚Äôm left with so much wax that I can‚Äôt burn.Such a good smell but I don‚Äôt think I will buy again if this keeps happening
4,1-Oct-20,2,"Broken flimsy box, weak bergamot smell I chose this candle for 2 reasons: the bergamot scent, and the gift-friendly box.I am told that is doesn't really smell like bergamot. And the box had completely fallen apart by the time I received it. I had to try and glue it back together myself.So the item failed my expectations on both accounts. I expected more from a $30 candle. Would not recommend."
4,2-Sep-20,5,"Amazing scent and made in the USA. While an unlikely combo of fragrances, Pineapple and Evergreen, it works and gives off a beautiful scent that burns cleanly.  Very giftable, but I would have liked separate boxes for the two candles as only one will be a gift and I will have to find a box or gift bag in which to put it.  Otherwise, very happy with the candles."
4,15-Aug-20,5,Great gift or for any reason smells Wonderful Beautiful candleI bought this for my daughters 18th BirthdayI like that it soy based and healthier to breathSmells so good!!!
4,31-Jul-19,5,"Lasts a long time and smells stunning! I absolutely love the look and the smell of this candle. Mango is always a good scent, but cedarwood infused?? It's a wonderful combination! I particularly like how long the soy candles last - I burn them for 3-5 hours at a time and they barely deplete each time. The packaging is simple and unique, and would make an excellent gift to anybody who loves candles."
4,15-Jan-20,5,Great Candle! I am amazed at the quality of this candle and will definitely purchase again. I have burned it every day for a week straight and the smell is still as strong as the first day.
4,13-Apr-20,5,Love the smell of pineapple Evergreen Just unpacked my candle and oh that smell coming out of the box!  Love the Pineapple Evergreen scent!
4,6-Apr-20,5,"Smells great and burns slow! So happy with this purchase! I usually buy candles from Bath and Body Works, but just can't justify buying them when they aren't on sale.  My friend recommended LuLu candles and I'm so glad i took the advice! I was apprehensive about the Pineapple Evergreen combo but it smells so good and the scent fills the entire kitchen/living room which is a pretty big space.  Very pleased and will be purchasing more!"
4,29-Mar-20,5,I have been looking for this smell This candle looks and smells awesome. Fragrance also lingers for a long time. The fact that it is a soy candles adds an extra point to the awesomeness :)I will buy this again and will recommend to my friends and family.
4,8-Jun-20,5,"Very elegant. Purchased the Jasmine, Oud, & Sandalwood...1- Scent is strong but not overpowering, the notes are mellow and balanced.2- Does not have a burning smell when you put it out and emits hardly any black smoke.3- Nice piece, almost like a piece of art. Very elegant to have sitting in your kitchen / living room / office or bedroom.Definetely recommended."
4,2-Jul-20,5,"First time buyer I just received it and I was definitely nervous about wether the scent would be what I was expecting or not. Obviously thats the biggest problem with ordering candles online is you can not smell them. However, it was perfect! I was sort of shocked. It smells amazing. Its been lit for about 5-10 minutes and has filled the room with its scent. It very clean looking and was well packaged. Will definitely order more."
4,17-Oct-19,5,Great candle I like the scent and that it burns slowly and evenly. they would make nice Christmas givers for stocking stuffers to. Plan to buy more of lulu candles
4,25-Oct-20,2,"Small flame, will burn itself out. I have purchased this brand of candles before and I loved them.  Many months later, I decided to order 3 new flavors and all came to me with the same problem.  The ‚Äúflame‚Äù is tiny, more like an ember, even if I swirl around the wax to make the wick longer.  A couple of times the candle burned itself out.  Super disappointing."
4,26-Dec-19,4,"Quality scent I went with the Fresh Linen Candle as a gift to my mom for Christmas. She really liked it. Left a pleasant scent in our kitchen the past couple days. Can't speak for the longevity of it just yet. She'll report back soon enough, but it's looking to hold up well so far. Give it a total 3.5-4 stars right now"
4,8-Sep-20,5,"I love these candles for my home and for gifts! I‚Äôve had several of these candles, and appreciate their pleasant scents and slow burn. I ordered one recently, just to have a nice gift ready for the next occasion. I chose the Pineapple Evergreen scent, and it seems like a winner!"
4,23-Aug-20,4,Bigger The scent was spot on it didn‚Äôt really fill the room up. The candle didn‚Äôt last long at all maybe 8 hours.
4,21-Apr-20,5,"Smells great, no artificial smells This was the first time I ever bought a candle online. I really like to smell a candle in person because I don‚Äôt like artificial scents, so I‚Äôm kinda picky. This was relatively inexpensive so I took the chance. I was pleasantly surprised, does not smell artificial at all. I bought the Wild Lemongrass scent to try and will definitely be sampling other ones now. Great smelling candle!"
4,20-Jan-20,1,Candle exploded by itself Candle exploded out of no where.  Hot glass melted into my carpet and almost set the table on fire. Great scent though lol.
4,3-Apr-20,5,My Go To candle This has been my go to candle lately. Every time I burn it I get compliments about how good my house smells. Good bang for your buck !
4,21-Nov-20,4,"Yummy scent dim wick. Loved the scent... fruity yet cozy. I normally get volcano or Jonathon Adler candles, but this scent intrigued me. The wick seems a little short?l or not strong enough where it seems it's going to burn out? Whatever. It smells yum"
4,9-Apr-20,5,"Love This Candle! This candle is great! I got the sexy man scent (lol) and it is great! It doesn't smell like cologne or someone that put on too much body spray, which I was worried about. This candle fills my small room up with a warm and inviting smell."
4,16-Jun-19,5,"Beautiful candle Not only does this candle smell great, but it‚Äôs nice packaging as well, so you don‚Äôt feel the need to hide the label. I got the Black Amber scent, as I prefer a more woodsy/sensual smell, and this is perfect."
4,23-Jul-20,5,"We LOVE it and it‚Äôs made in America!!! This fully-fledged candle is fragrant, classy, and most welcoming! The scent graced the room upon removal of the lid. We love it!!!"
4,26-Aug-20,5,"The Perfect Scent This candle had amazing reviews before I ordered it, which definitely peaked my interest. I am in the midst of moving into an apartment and wanted to find something for my room to have it smell good, but not too overwhelming like some of those stores at the mall. This candle has the perfect balance of scent and strength. Highly recommend!"
4,24-Apr-20,5,Great scent and looks amazing! I've been looking for a nice candle for home decor for ages and stumbled upon this candle. I love its overall look and am really happy with its quality. Plus it smells amazing! Will buy again for sure :)
4,25-Oct-20,5,Wayyyy better than Yankee Candle Smells delicious. I don‚Äôt even need to light it and it fills the room up with the smell of coffee. I love it and you will too!
4,13-Dec-18,4,"Lemon pledge Not a true lemon grass scent. I wouldn't order it again. However, I would order the fresh linen again. If I hadn't tried the second, it would have been one star. I will say that these candles do burn a long time and they burn very clean."
4,19-May-20,5,Great aroma that lasts. This candle is So nice! It has such a fresh scent and burns very clean. It lasts a long time & creates a warm cozy ambience I very much appreciate. Highly recommended.
4,12-Nov-20,5,"The best scent I absolutely love this candle! Not only is it pretty, but the scent is amazing! Last a long time and I always have one on hand!"
4,14-Sep-20,4,I would buy it again I really like this candle for a small room or bathroom. The smell is fresh and clean. If it's in the bathroom you can smell it but when in the kitchen I couln't smell it. The burning is slow which was great. Overall I would buy this again.
4,30-Sep-20,5,awesome! It smells really good! can‚Äôt wait to burn it - very light fragrance but smells very inviting
4,21-May-20,5,Great fragrance! One of the best candles I have ever purchased.  The fragrance is strong and fills the whole downstairs.  If you like a strong candle this is the one for you.
4,22-May-20,5,Great smelling candles!!!!! We absolutely love these candles! They smell AMAZING! People always think we are baking cupcakes when we light the cupcake scented one. Highly recommend!
4,4-Dec-19,5,"I went from a soy boy to a man. I was a little upset because my friend says that I am too girly.  I bought this candle to meditate and bring the masculinity out of me. After I finished a brief meditation, I looked in the mirror and realized I had grown a beard. My shoulders became boulder-like and jaw looked so chiseled it can cut diamond. Don't believe me? Try it."
4,8-Oct-20,5,"Love this candle! This candle came in the most beautiful packaging, and was wrapped so well! Love the scent, and it burns evenly. I read other reviews complaining about how small this is, and I did not think this was a small candle! Love it!"
4,29-Mar-20,5,lemongrass candle Just received the wild lemongrass scented candle. It has a very nice clean smell. Very happy with this purchase. Would recommend to others.
4,13-Aug-20,5,"What a smell! These are somewhat small, but wow what a punch with the smell from the Tobacco, Spice & Vanilla. Will buy again. Smells great!"
4,25-May-20,5,Wonderful smell and clean burning.... I‚Äôve always loved the smell of Nag Champa and this candle smells wonderful. Very clean burning and long lasting.
4,5-Jul-20,5,"Small yet powerful candle is a long lasting option to add in to your rotation I was surprised with how much I like these candles! I tried two scents- Fresh Linen & Wild Lemongrass, both perfume a space quickly and smell great! I must admit I was discouraged by the size initially (6 oz fits in the palm of my hand) but have come to realize that the candle doesn‚Äôt burn as quickly so it still seems like reasonable longevity. I plan on repurchasing again, i think it could be a nice gift"
4,22-Dec-19,5,"Better than Expected!! I got this item for a gift, not sure how it will burn just yet...  it came in wonderful packaging and the scent is amazing.  Not too sweet, a good balance of the evergreen/forestry and pineapple/tropical.  The box and wrapping it came in is absolutely great, was much more fancy than I had expected."
4,3-Apr-20,5,Great hipster candle! Wanted a candle that preformed the way a $50 designer candle would but obviously much more inexpensive.  Your home will smell like j crew.
4,13-Aug-20,4,"Great smell, but overpriced for the size. I love the smell of this candle, and the smell is strong enough to smell throughout the house. The size of the candle is small for the price. I would buy this again because it does smell amazing!"
4,29-Jan-19,5,"Very long lasting and beautiful scent (linen) I have always  purchased scented candles at discount stores and got sick of artificial scents, and candles that burned down in a couple of evenings.  This candle is amazing.  It has an elegant label, and I burned it for the first time for about 5 hours... it doesn't look like it burned down at all.  The scent is lovely, not too strong.  It's definitely worth paying a bit extra for soy wax.  I will be purchasing the Lulu brand from now on."
4,4-Dec-19,5,"Great scent, solid price and clean looks.  A perfect modern candle. Great little candles! Ordered pineapple evergreen after reading many recommendations, and im impressed. Burns nice and slow, smells great, and its simple clean label fits right in with modern decor. Ordered another for my bathroom. Good stuff!"
4,1-Nov-20,4,"Great product, but small. The candle is great, it has a really nice scent but not too over powering. My only knock on this is its price versus its size. $15 is a bit on the high side to spend on a 6oz candle; nevertheless I did purchase it because the description, and the label on the candle, says that $3 of the candle purchase is donated to groups that rescue abandoned dogs."
4,23-Mar-20,5,beyond impressed by the pineapple and evergreen I was hesitant to buy the pineapple and evergreen scent because I wasn't sure how the two smells would interact with each other. but I'm so glad that I decided to try it because it smells amazing! I have dogs and the candle does a pretty good job at masking the smell of their dog food at breakfast and dinner. The candle design logo is simple and looks very clean. I'm really glad I decided to order!!
4,19-Sep-20,5,Fresh and Light So fresh and not overpowering scent. My mom and I have asthma which is easily irritated by some candles. I was pleasantly surprised with this and will buy more in the future!
4,7-Jul-20,5,"Smells Amazing I bought this as a gift for my coffee loving friend and even before I fully opened the box I could smell the scent. It was nice and not too strong. Can't speak on if it fills up the room, but I would imagine this is good for a bedroom or something similar in size. It came in a box big enough to hold the jar compactly, and in a bubble wrap envelope."
4,24-Aug-20,4,"So happy I just rented my first apartment and bought the Apple Cinnamon scent to remind me of happy fall memories with my family and I'm SO pleased with the smell. I love that the purchase comes with a donation to animal charities, that is part in why I choice this candle. I haven't had the chance to light it yet, but I can tell that the smell is deep and should last a long time after lighting."
4,2-Apr-20,5,"Wonderful smell and long lasting I ordered this candle on a whim, since I don't usually like to order a candle that I haven't smelled.  However, when it arrived, I was pleasantly surprised.  The smell is strong enough to fill a room, but by no means overwhelming.  So, of course, I ordered a bunch more.  I have bamboo rose, tobacco, midnight in paris, and cedarwood mango.  They are all very nice smelling and the candles last for 30+ hours.  I highly recommend these candles."
4,22-Oct-20,5,"Great Scent I use candles only after cooking, so I am not sure about longevity.The scent is perfect. As it is a soy candle, I would choose this for a gift to cat owners."
4,21-Feb-20,5,"Sweet fragrance, clean burn Smells so nice! Buying candles online is always a gamble but I‚Äôm happy with this. The scent of the whole candle can be intense, but once lit it is a nice clean perfume. It burns cleanly and has pretty, minimalist labeling."
4,29-May-20,5,"The BEST coffee scent I don't drink coffee but I absolutely LOVE the scent of coffee.  Since I have been working from home, I decided to purchase a coffee scented candle to light in the mornings.  I was very pleasantly surprised with the fabulous scent.  Even when I don't have the candle lit, I find myself smelling the candle.  I only got it last week, so I am not sure about the longevity, but the scent is perfect."
4,23-Jul-20,4,"Smells nice, but not strong. I have bought a few of these candles, and they last forever- and have great output of smell. All except ""sexy man"" which is shame, because it has subtle, sweet, musky smell which I really like! You just literally can't smell it unless you are standing above it. Other aromas are nice though and you can smell throughout the house!"
4,10-Sep-20,5,Great scent and slow burn Have been burning this candle for about two hours and the smell is definitely present but not overbearing. I'm also surprised by how slow it's been burning compared to my usual candles. The price for the 9oz. size is the only drawback but if it lasts as long as my 14oz. candles then it'll be worth it.
4,23-May-20,5,"Who'd a thought! Pineapple Evergreen - it's great clean smell.  Only thing I wish it came in a box or with a top to store it - great marketing though cause I lit it right away!!Looking  forward to tying other ""flavors"""
4,17-Jul-19,5,"Smells Good and Burns Slow After reading all the rave reviews, I decided to try out this candle. It's a bit small, but it does burn slow, so you get more use out of it. It smells delicious and definitely puts a warm aroma throughout the house!"
4,18-Nov-20,5,"Smells great! This candle is strong smelling, and a perfect blend between vanilla and tobacco. It's sweet without being cloying because of the tobacco. It smells strong enough that having it on my nightstand and not burning it even makes the room smell good. Nice to find good smells in soy candles at a good value!"
4,12-Apr-20,5,"Unique pleasing scent, attractive design and long burning! Really great candle. The candle is really great. The smell is unique and unlike anything I‚Äôve smelled before. I have been burning for a very many days  and it‚Äôs holding up well which is impressive. The simple design of the candle holder is modern and attractive without drawing too much attention in a space. I would highly recommend this candle and this scent."
4,27-Oct-20,1,Wild lemongrass ?üëé?üèª This is very weird. Lulu candles have become my favorite candles. But this one is very disappointing. No scent at all and I burned it for over one hour and nothing. Nothing!!!
4,6-Jul-20,4,"Subtle and soothing candle! This is a wonderful candle, subtle and pleasing scent, and slow burning.  I bought this to give as a gift, and expected the size to be somewhat larger!  Everything else is perfect.Perhaps for clarity of size, and less disappointment, it might be wise to add a hand holding it in a picture portraying the size.Otherwise, a great product!"
4,14-Mar-20,4,"Clean burning candle! This candle is attractive and the main reason that Ipurchased it was for cleaner burning becasue it is soy based instead of parafinn based.  The scent is very nice, but it did not get 5 stars only becasue when burning, the scent is not as strong as I would like it to be.  Ideally, the candle would have a lid, other than that I would recommend it."
4,1-Mar-19,5,"great scent Awesome candle, but the amount you get for the price imho is a little too high. All around great product, just need more of it without the cost of an arm and leg! Will most likely be purchasing again."
4,15-Jun-20,5,New favorite candle! Beautiful packaging and candle has a great fragrance even when unlit. I‚Äôve bought candles on amazon before and the fragrance can sometimes seem less concentrated than when they are bought in the store but not this one. The quality is great!
4,24-Mar-20,2,Not bad but not great Not giving the best review due to the candle not smelling like the description. But it still smelled nice. Also wick burns fast. Bath and body works has better and larger candles for almost the same price when you catch their sales.
4,3-Jun-20,5,"FRESH I bought two candles,  the Lemon/Vanilla Bean & the Fresh Linen and I LOVE the way they smell! They are not overpowering and fake smelling - the scents are very fresh and subtle. I have two dogs and I felt like my house had a slight ""dog smell"", but I just light one of these before having guests and they always compliment me on how the house smells. 10/10 would recommend!"
4,10-Dec-19,5,"Unique & fun candle! I love the unique scent of pineapple and evergreen mixed together! Gifting it to my husband for Christmas as he loves Evergreen smells and I love the fruity touch. It's not too sweet smelling though. I haven't lit the candle yet though, so I can't comment on that. It just comes in a regular cardboard box, but it's packed well so I don't think it has a chance of breaking. The label looks very nice and high end."
4,20-Jan-20,5,Loving this candle! Design and branding are sweet and clean....would make a great gift!  Also LOVE the scent.  Passionfruit and Mango.  I only use soy candles.  It burns clean and smells fantastic.  Very happy!
4,18-Aug-19,5,"I ordered the pineapple evergreen I ordered the pineapple evergreen. Really nice and subtle smell. Also, burns great! I bought it as a gift to someone and then, bought myself one :D"
4,3-Jul-20,5,Amazing Scent & Slow Burn These are really beautifully scented soy candles. I highly recommend the vanilla and the pineapple evergreen.
4,27-Jun-20,5,Lovely candle Love this candle. Was curious about the pineapple and evergreen scent and it didn‚Äôt disappoint. Maybe a little smaller than I would have liked but there are larger sizes.
4,11-Apr-20,5,"All good :) I have the vanilla oak. Smells nice, a warm, perfumy/florally vanilla. The specific size I got is probably not giftable as it did not come with a lid, but it notes this very clearly in the product description. It is for my own personal use so I don‚Äôt mind. Love the design of the label and the sleek white."
4,7-May-20,5,Amazing I‚Äôm very impressed with these candles. They burn so clean the scent is amazing I bought them several times and gifted them to my daughter and now she buys them. My house smells so clean and fresh there an amazing company and I won‚Äôt be doing business with anyone else but them thank you Lulu candles
4,26-Jan-20,5,Heavenly! Just picked this lovely little thing up from UPS.  I have pets so have been looking for a nontoxic way to make my home smell like comfort while being cautious of the effects on my fur babies. This smell is HEAVEN! I need everything on Pineapple Evergreen please! Highly recommend. Will definitely purchase again!
4,1-Jun-20,5,A MUST HAVE! Smells amazingly! I burns low and slow but perfumes my whole apartment (2bd2bth). The look of the candle is perfect for my decor too because it's clean looking and neutral. I got the Fresh Linen Scent.
4,21-Feb-20,4,"Lovely tobacco sent I really enjoyed this candle. The tobacco sent is more noticeable than other vanilla tobacco candles I've purchased. Usually the vanilla is too overpowering. My only complaint is that I wish it was bigger, especially since it cost so much."
4,29-Mar-20,5,Love I was a little nervous about trying this candle because i‚Äôm more of a warmer scent type of person... but I do really like the fresh clean scent. It‚Äôs really nice and not overbearing. I bought this for my bathroom but brought it into my room because It smells so good! It burns slowly too so I love that as well.
4,28-Mar-20,5,THESE SMELL SO GOOD! These candles actually smell so good. i think they're a lot better looking and presentable than normal candles from big store brands like yankee candle. Did i mention they smell good? It actually smells exactly what you think it would smell like after you've spent 5 hours cleaning the shit out of your room. It's that good.
4,15-Sep-20,5,"Fresh Linen- Perfect for A Casual Smell This is my first time ordering a candle online, and I am very happy that it lived up to the hype. I like smells that aren't too overpowering and fragrant, so the Fresh Linen Candle was perfect for that clean smell. A little seems to go a long way, and it is still very scented. It comes in a cute jar, so I'm excited to reuse it!"
4,30-Jun-19,5,Smells great!! I am pleasantly surprised with this candle! It‚Äôs pretty small but the scent fills up my whole living room very quickly. I got the amber rose & musk and it‚Äôs lovely.
4,23-May-20,3,"Way too small for its price I always buy candles from Marshalls. Unfortunately, during this time I can't go there. This candle has a really nice smell and it is very strong but with the $15 I could have gotten a candle that is 4 times as big as this. It fits in the palms of my hands and I have small hands."
4,16-Sep-20,5,"Very Aromatic Candle with a Slow Burn I really enjoyed this candle from the moment I opened the box. You can smell it right away, it's that strong. The sugared pecans scent is perfect for the holidays too! I'm really enjoying this candle so far, as it is burning slowly but enough to get good lighting and scents. It looks as if it'll last for a long time which is fantastic. Will definitely buy more!"
4,29-Oct-19,5,Awesomeness ‚ô° Wild Leongrass smells amazing. Keep in mind the 6oz-size is small.. it would fit in a woman's hand & not cover the entire palm.
4,8-Mar-20,5,BUY THIS CANDLE OR YOU WILL REGRET IT I ordered the espresso bean candle and received it on Friday. Before I even opened the box I could smell it. This candle is amazing. It truly smells like freshly ground coffee. It‚Äôs refreshing without being overpowering. I will 100% buy this again as well as gift it for every housewarming I go to until the end of time.
4,4-Nov-20,5,This candle is great I've never written an amazon review before but felt the need to share the gospel about this candle.I got it yesterday and have only lit it 1 time for maybe a few minutes.The scent (in the best way) stains everything in its vicinity - made my room smell permanently great.I'm a big new fan of these and will definitely buy more.
4,23-Sep-20,5,"Slow burn, strong and lovely smell This candle is slow burning, so the flame is tiny and you can leave it burning for a long time before it even makes a dent in the wax. But it also has a very strong scent. The best of both worlds! I will buy many more (once this one runs out, which may take a while!)"
4,19-Nov-18,2,Cheap Smell Two stars because of cheap smell. Smells like a candel you can buy from the pharmacy or supermarket. Not worth thw price.
4,24-Jun-20,5,"Buttercream Vanilla Cupcake ‚ÄúGiftee‚Äù writing: I received this as a birthday present! The packaging is durable to make it to you safe and sound. The smell can take up a room; as soon as I opened it I smelled a sweet vanilla cake waiting for me. Oh it‚Äôs lovely. Take heed of the notice deterring you from candle warmers and melters, I‚Äôm assuming because of the paper sticker on the bottom of the glass container."
4,30-May-20,5,Smells great! Very nice candle- love that it is soy. Smells great but not overpowering. Very happy with my purchase!
4,1-Feb-19,4,"long-lasting fragrances The Lemon Vanilla Bean, Pineapple Evergreen and Sweet Pea, Jasmine & Apple are lovely.  I received Lemon Vanilla Bean for Christmas and ordered another right away.  I'll continue purchasing these.  Pricier but worth it.Long burning and long-lasting fragrance.Fine Suede & Sugared Pecans were too strong and we found then unpleasant.  I returned them."
4,25-Feb-20,4,"Incense Smell This candle makes a great gift and looks like it comes from an artisinal market or boutique. I'm generally a fan of  subtle cedarwood/sandalwood/vanilla type scents. This candle smells nice, but it's a little too strong for my taste. It has a smell similar to incense, and if you're a big fan of sandalwood, you'll likely enjoy it!"
4,20-Jun-20,5,Favorite scent; very simple beautiful candle I love how aesthetically simple this candle is. The scent is amazing and versatile- would highly recommend.
4,27-May-20,5,Why is this candle so good? I had been disappointed with candles from major stores and decided to shop on amazon because of the more reliable and numerous reviews. Great decision. Great reviews because it‚Äôs a great candle. I will be buying their other scents as well.
4,9-Aug-20,5,"Smells good Bought as s housewarming gift for my sister and she loved it, said it smelled really nice."
4,20-May-20,5,Very satisfied I like the smell but I would like to see it in a larger jar. It‚Äôs goo for a small room like a bathroom.
4,9-Feb-20,5,Love this!! This was a gift for my sisters birthday! She loved it and I personally loved the scent and the look of it as well! I would definitely recommend this to others and I would buy it again
4,18-Oct-20,4,"The tobacco spice is more vanilla Ok! I‚Äôm very impressed this 6 oz candle. I went with the Tobacco spice and vanilla and it‚Äôs def the fall smell I wanted.More on the vanilla side, kinda wish there was more tobacco.This would be a great gift for someone. IMO you really should get a bigger size if you‚Äôre going to put it in the house. Interested in how long it will last!"
4,22-Nov-20,2,"Not the clean scent you‚Äôd hope for Artificial linen scent, not my style. Smelled more like laundry detergent but not in a good way."
4,4-Nov-19,5,You‚Äôre missing out! Bought this for our anniversary. We wanted a different smell. This was....amazing! I wish I had an entire cabinet of this candle! The scent is nice and pine-like....yet....sweet. I love it! Will definitely purchase again!!!
4,10-Aug-20,5,"MADE MY MOTHER'S BIRTHDAY! This product was bought for my mother's 77th Birthday and she just loved it!  Right from the beginning of it having ""Happy Birthday"" on it, to the lovely, soft smell it has.  She enjoys all things vanilla, so, this candle really made her day!Thanks, Lulu and we look forward to making more purchases with your company!Karen Jordan, a happy daughter who made her mother happy!!"
4,4-Oct-19,5,New Favorite! First time purchase was Apple Cinnamon scent. I really wanted to fill my home with sweet memories of apple season. I love candles but I'm usually sensitive to them so I was hesitant. Not only does this candle smell AMAZING but I don't get headaches when I burn it. I love that this company puts so much love into their product and that they support animal shelters. Just bought a second for as a gift and will be back for more!
4,20-Jun-20,5,My new signature scent Somehow this is the perfect scent.  Summer and winter in one. Light yet earthy. Absolutely amazing.
4,16-Jul-20,5,"Great scent! This is my 1st order, but definitely not my last. I love the lemon/vanilla scent. It‚Äôs not too strong like some other brands. The packages is cute with the basic black label...very classy. Matches my farmhouse theme! I can‚Äôt wait to try other scents."
4,15-Apr-20,4,"Smaller than I anticipated, cute box, good smell This is a cute candle and the vanilla smells lovely but it is very small for the price."
4,13-Sep-20,5,"Loved the scent and long lasting! I was nervous to buy a candle without smelling it, but now in 2020 going to a store and touching and smelling every candle in a store is a worse idea! So I took a risk and was pleasantly surprised by this one! The vanilla balances the tobacco and spices without being sweet. It‚Äôs a great candle for Fall in my opinion, and the candle burns slowly so it lasts."
4,27-Oct-20,5,Beautiful scent I only burn soy candles for health reasons. This candle has a beautiful scent and seems it will last a while. Love it!
4,6-Feb-19,3,Low value I didn‚Äôt realize how small the candle would be.  It‚Äôs expensive for the size. The lemongrass smell is nice.
4,10-Nov-20,5,Burns long smells fantastic Smells absolutely divine and seems have a long burn life! Happy camper! I wish a larger one was in stock!
4,24-Aug-20,5,"perfect sweet but not too sweet scent. The labeling on this candle blends with any modern aesthetic.  The scent is just what I was looking for...something with vanilla, but not so sweet that it made me want to bake!  This is the perfect smoky vanilla scent that is sweet without being sickly.  I bought this for myself, but can definitely see buying again for gifts.  Like that it's poured in USA."
4,10-Aug-20,5,"Great Scent This candle has a great scent and lasts a long time.  I burned this candle over two hours and it barely burned off any wax.  If you like Our and Sandlewood scents, I highly recommend this product.  I do wish this candle had a lid.  This would make it better as a gift and also help put the candle out."
4,2-Mar-20,5,"Espresso Bean I opened the amazon envelope, and despite the candle being wrapped AND boxed, the bag smelled like the drive-thru window of a Starbucks had just opened up and a burst of coffee scent came through. It smells truly so good. And usually, I don't go for food-related scents, but this is just like a coffee shop. SO GOOD! Worth the money."
4,23-Mar-20,4,"Nice product/reasonable price Initially, I thought it was a little pricey for the size but it is a very slow burning candle so it lasts like a larger one.  The linen smell is beautiful and clean and I appreciate it being soy and hand poured.  When you consider all its qualities together,  you‚Äôre getting a good product for the price."
4,26-Jan-20,3,"Lulu Candles Bought a few different scents from Lulu Candles all at once. The jars+packaging are really pretty, and the more woodsy scents are really nice! Some of the sweeter or food-scented candles came off a bit too creamy/sickly, and the candles overall aren't the most scented I've ever bought, but they're really nice as decor!"
4,28-Oct-19,5,Solid 5 stars Simply an incredible candle! The sweet pea and Jasmine scent is heavenly. I love the minimal design -- these candles will easily make great gifts. I can't wait to try other scents available here. I am so excited that I finally found a candle that I'm completely in love with!
4,17-Oct-20,5,This is the best If I could just have an endless supply of this on hand I would be forever grateful. Best smelling candle I‚Äôve ever had the pleasure of burning. ?üòç
4,14-Feb-20,5,Pineapple Evergreen is so worth a try! I got this for my girlfriend looking for something a little different than lavender.  The Pineapple Evergreen threw me at first but I read another review that sold me.  I was not disappointed with this at all.  She absolutely loved it.  The two scents do combine well and are definitely worth a try.
4,29-Mar-20,5,Great smell. Good for it‚Äôs price I love this lemongrass fresh scent. If you like clean smells you‚Äôll love this. The design Im of the Candel is also Clean and simple. Which I Im appreciate.
4,24-Sep-20,5,Heavenly OMG! this candle is the best smelling candle I ever purchased. I will definitely order of their different scents.
4,3-Feb-20,4,"Bought it accidentally... I ordered this scent accidentally as I wanted a different scent, but since it‚Äôs the number one selling candle I decided to give it a try.  It smells like laundry day in my house and it‚Äôs so clean and nice.  I am glad I didn‚Äôt return it and will buy it again.  It‚Äôs a little different scent than I like this time of year, but come Spring it will be my number 1 candle!"
4,28-Apr-20,4,Cinnamon Apple Scent - Good for Fall The scent is nice. I especially like the donation to an animal cause. Wish it were bigger for the price. I would buy this again for the fall season instead of spring. Thanks!
4,12-Aug-19,5,"Best candles! I love lulucandles! I have gotten the scents ""fresh linen,"" ""pineapple evergreen,"" and ""wild lemongrass."" All these scents smell AMAZING and last really long! I will definitely keep ordering these candles."
4,8-Nov-20,5,Smooth I haven‚Äôt lighted it yet but does smell nice like a man. Not to harsh. More like a softer manly smell
4,4-Apr-20,5,"Perfect scent I purchased one of these candles as a birthday gift for a friend, but the Pineapple Evergeeen scent caught my eye so I purchased that one for myself. And I'm in love! Before even getting it out of the box, the smell was potent and so lovely. Just sitting on my coffee table not burning, I can smell it around the house, which is nice for longevity."
4,13-Sep-20,5,Delicious smell This smells like literal birthday cake and I love it. When it came in the mail I almost didn‚Äôt give it my friend for her birthday. So I ordered one for myself and I Love how sweet and happy my home smells with it
4,15-Apr-20,5,"Fantastic scent, decent burn time This candle smells AMAZING! I was a bit wary of the scent being ‚Äúlike men‚Äôs cologne‚Äù but it is not overpowering or intrusive. It adds a fantastic masculine smell to a room quickly and lasts a decent amount of time. My only complaint is that I‚Äôd like for it to last longer, but that would just mean Lulu Candles would have to make larger candles for me to buy! :)"
4,28-Oct-20,3,Small candle Smells good. My fault for not reading the size dimensions. It‚Äôs tiny for the price.
4,25-Jan-20,5,Love this candle! Lemongrass is lovely scent The scent is clean and fresh and it burns cleanly.  I even have gifted it and received many thanks!!
4,18-Dec-19,5,Great candle! I got passion fruit infused mango and it smells amazing! Very fruity and it makes the whole room smell great!
4,29-Sep-19,5,"A scent you can enjoy! One of the better scented candles I have tried, aroma is lovely and lasts and lasts. Sturdy candle, attractive -highly recommend"
4,19-Dec-19,5,"Quality non-toxic candle with unique (non-overpowering) scent! Love this scent - such a fun take on a holiday scent. Purchased for gifts for co-workers and they loved as well. I purchased one for myself! I did also purchase the sandalwood blend scent and it was a good scent, but much stronger. This is nice for someone sensitive to candle scents. Also, finding a candle that is made without toxins was very important to me."
4,21-Feb-20,5,"Great scent, great customer service! I really like the scent of this candle... it's very balanced and fresh!! The scent of sandalwood is a bit more faint than I'd like but the overall scent is fantastic.There was a slight issue with my order but LULU candles promptly took care of it and were very kind. Definitely recommend!"
4,23-Jun-20,2,"Great smell, not enough throw I bought this candle with the hope of finding a cheaper alternative to Bath & Bodyworks candles and didn‚Äôt find it here. The scent (Pineapple Evergreen), packaging, and price were all great but where the candle fell short was the the strength of the scent. After the initial burn I could hardly smell the candle at all."
4,31-Aug-20,4,"Love the look I have this candle on display and love the look of it. Obviously testing out a scent online is hard to tell, so thought it would be a little muskier than it is, but it's clean and refreshing for those who like lighter scents. I personally would like something a little more on the stronger side, but definitely will use it and then try out other scents."
4,20-Oct-20,5,Lemony This is a very nice candle and the lemon scent was nice a strong opening the package.  It is not as strong now lit.  It's in a nice glass jar and would make a lovely gift.
4,11-Jun-19,5,"Amazing Fragrance This is probably the best candle I‚Äôve ever used. It lasts a very long time, it burns clean, and the wild lemongrass smells fantastic. I‚Äôll definitely be buying this again."
4,12-Oct-19,5,"Wonderful smell in a candle The fragrance is unbelievable! When it is not burning, the smell still Flows through the room, with such a pleasant aroma.I have the jasmine, oud and sandalwood candle. It would make a lovely gift, also!"
4,25-Mar-20,5,"Perfect combination of high quality and great price I was so pleased with this candle! I read all of the reviews and they are true and then some. I burned this candle for about five hours and I couldn‚Äôt even tell, it looked brand new afterward. It smells so good and it‚Äôs very subtle yet filled my whole house with a scent of freshness and clean smelling goodness. I am going to order more of these!"
4,29-May-20,1,Complete Waste of Money The candle is super small and basically unscented. I was misled by the positive reviews. The company gives you a free candle for posting a review. I‚Äôm sure that‚Äôs why there are so many positive reviews. Save your money.
4,31-Dec-19,5,Long lasting scent Me and my husband loved this candle we almost hated to burn it we wanted to make it last as long as possible. We started lighting it on special occasions lol well the scent is a very strong blueberry and it permeates the entire home! Loved this ! That‚Äôs what I look for when buying a candle.
4,11-May-20,5,"Meets all expectations! Love this candle!! It‚Äôs the size I expected from reading other reviews so don‚Äôt be surprised if it‚Äôs a bit small. But it packs a punch, fills a room but not to headache-point. Just to the point where people will stop and ask ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs that amazing scent?‚Äù 5/5 can‚Äôt wait to try the others"
4,31-Aug-20,5,"Clean, simple, great scent I bought this product for my 2 year cotton anniversary. I got ""sexy man"" scent for my husband and with the cotton wick (and soy) it's not only fun to give but healthier. I love the simplistic look of the candle making it really awesome to be able to give to GUYS and girls alike."
4,9-Nov-20,5,LOVE the expresso bean LOVE the scent of the expresso bean variant! My only regret is that it doesn't last longer.
4,5-Sep-20,5,How long it last This is one of the best candles ever. It last a longer time then other brands of candles. One candle makes my whole how smell so good and the scent lingers. This is my first time purchasing this candle but it will not be the last time.Thanks to the person who created such great quality candles.
4,25-Nov-19,3,Just ok It was just ok. It smells great when you bury your nose in it but it just doesn't put off enough scent when lit.
4,31-May-19,5,"Best Smell! So I thought I was buying the lemongrass scent, as I have been on a citrus kick. This scent however is awesome! Its very clean and you suddenly have the feeling you need a pina colada! ?üç?"
4,8-Sep-19,5,"Awesome scent, clean slow burning candle! Bought this for myself, had never seen a lemongrass scented candle so was curious - wow, awesome scent! Clean and distinct but not overpowering, I left it burning for about 2 hours and the candle was virtually unchanged - this candle  will last a long time..."
4,21-Jan-19,5,"Lasts surprisingly long Very high-quality candle. I bought the 6 oz Pineapple Evergreen candle. I know the smells description sounds strange but they actually go really well together. Keep the wick trimmed to 1/4"", let it burn till the top layer of wax melts, and this candle will last well over 40 hours. Lasts longer than any other soy wax candle I've bought."
4,9-Aug-20,5,"smells like pineapple! I just received the pineapple evergreen candle in the mail and I'm pleasantly surprised! When i first started oepning the package i thought it smelt like that pink bubblegum you get on Halloween but when you open the candle and actually burn it, it smells really good!The pineapple smell is very evident and I can't wait to try their other candles!"
4,10-Oct-20,5,"Lulu Pineapple Evergreen Candle This was a first time purchase for me when I bought the 6oz candle. I looked at other reviews for Lulu candles and seen a high review rate on the Pineapple Evergreen. Was I glad that I got this one! The smells compliment each other so well, love it. Will be getting the larger size next time if they‚Äôre not sold out!"
4,7-Apr-20,5,Relaxing smell. This is my new favorite candle. The scent #14 smells amazing. It‚Äôs not over powerful it‚Äôs just perfect. I love to burn this candle and pour a glass of wine and listen to some good relaxing music.
4,21-Jan-19,4,"Love the scent but disappointed-  9oz doesn‚Äôt come with a lid (6oz did) I bought the 6oz and loved the scent! So I bought the 9oz this time and was disappointed the larger size does not come with a lid (as the 6oz did). I know it‚Äôs not a huge deal but would‚Äôve appreciated consistency when ordering the same product (especially at a larger size). Other than that, the scent (sweet pea, jasmine, and apple) is really nice!"
4,22-Sep-20,5,"A fun, great-smelling gift! I purchased the Sexy Man candle as a funny birthday gift, and it arrived VERY quickly.  It smells great!"
4,9-Nov-20,5,Nice fragrance without lighting it! I bought the pillar size cedar wood infused mango. Love it!!! The fragrance fills the room instantly without even lighting it! Please make more of that size in different scents please!!!
4,1-Jul-20,5,Smelled it right out the box. Love the candles. Definitely buying more. Burns slow and the best part they used soy.
4,4-Feb-20,5,Favorite Candles Ever I love lulus candles. I first received the vanilla buttercream cupcake as a gift. It was so delicious smelling I had to order my own when I ran out. I got the lemon biscotti and I am not disappointed. The scent is the perfect amount of power. Delicious.
4,8-Jan-20,5,"Great for the price I have always used the big jar, non-soy candles.  My daughter recently bought a soy candle, and I wanted to try one of my own.  I have burned this one, blueberry cobbler, for two days now.  Out side of being uneven on the edges, it doesn't look like I have used it.  It also has kept the smell much better than the large expensive ones.  It is my new favorite candle!"
4,1-Jun-20,5,"Yummy! This candle smells wonderful! It‚Äôs not overpowering, which I need because of my sensitive nose, but still fills my whole apartment with that warm, lemon and vanilla smell. Like I just made lemon cookies. Mmmm. Like a Lorna doone, but lemon. Delicious."
4,19-Aug-20,3,"Save your money Have no idea why this has great reviews, it has a nice scent but short lived and takes a long burn to get that. I wouldn‚Äôt have spent the money on this!"
4,14-May-20,5,Love it. I love the way these candles look; My favorites part. They look cool without being over done and too cutesy. This fresh linen scent smells so good but not over bearing at all. Just a fresh aroma.
4,11-Apr-20,4,"Smells great! This candle smells really nice, and I like it a lot. It is a bit smaller than I expected but it seems to be burning slowly enough that it will last a long time. It would make a great gift and I'm looking forward to trying other scents!"
4,19-May-20,5,"One of the best... I typically get candles from the candle aisle at Marshall's, nabbing anything in the sandalwood/ambergris/cedarwood family. Basically: earthy/woody scents. What a difference buying directly from the source makes! This is FAR better than anything I picked up on discount. Sweet but woody; and burns for hours and hours and hours. Highly recommended."
4,29-Jul-20,3,"Disappointing So disappointed doesn't last longer esp for the price, no where near 40 hours..."
4,4-Jan-19,5,"Good quality, will buy again Great scent, nutty and sweet but not overpowering. My husband commented that it was better than any other candle I had purchased from Amazon. And impressed with how long it lasts and the quality of scent even after using half of it (some tend to lose their scent after the first few lightings). Would def recommend and will buy again."
4,15-Oct-20,5,"Long lasting! I have gotten this candle twice, the first time I got Lemon Vanilla, and this time I got Pineapple Evergreen! Both times it smelled great and the scent lingered even after the candle was out. I have to say I liked lemon-vanilla the best despite the comment section raving on pineapple evergreen. I absolutely love these candles and I'll definitely be ordering more !"
4,15-Jan-20,5,Love this candle brand! I bought this specific candle brand based on it being an Amazon best-seller. I received it the very next day and I absolutely love it already. I chose the linen scent and will be purchasing multiple other scents in the future. I love the packaging and the scent lasts. Highly recommend LuLu Candles.
4,7-May-19,5,"OH THE SMELL (drools) I bought this candle as a present for my client. I am organizing her office and she works for Norwex, so of course I chose the fresh linen one. I haven‚Äôt burnt it but it smells AMAZING from just opening it! I will definitely be getting more of this for my future cients, as there are plenty of choices that I can customize for each client, they are soy based so safe for everyone, and look great! Thanks!!"
4,14-Nov-19,5,Amazing! Seriously smells so good and filled a large room! Most small candles don‚Äôt work well in large areas but this one did great!!!
4,16-Sep-20,5,So good! Amazing fragrance - relaxing and sophisticated - even better than I hoped!  Part of my wish list for my birthday.  I will definitely buy as a gift for others in the future.
4,8-Nov-20,5,Excellent Product I totally love it and it the scent/smell is wonderful!  Very much worth the Price. Delivered very timely as well.
4,8-Jul-20,5,"Smells clean! Came the next day with Prime shipping, packaged very well, if not excessively, lol. (Bubble envelope>small box>packing paper>tissue paper>candle) Smells fantastic and looks sleek on the shelf. Will be purchasing again!"
4,15-Apr-20,5,Great soy wax candle Love that it‚Äôs soy wax burns cleanly and long lasting plus the smell fills my home with wonderful pineapple scent.
4,19-Jul-20,4,"Good clean scent The candle had pleasant scent.I will say, it was pricey for quantity and quality."
4,23-Jun-20,5,The smell! I LOVE this candle!  I previously bought candles at a store called Illuminations and then they closed.  The closest thing to their scents is this candle.  They make great gifts and the smell is consistent until the very last flicker.  I wish the candle came in larger sizes.  I continue to purchase this scent and will have to venture out into the other aroma offerings by this seller.
4,9-Jul-20,5,Candle I‚Äôd buy again and again Great unusual scent that you can really smell. Lasts a long time. Highly recommend
4,2-Oct-20,5,"Great Smelling Candle love it I bought three of the FURR A CAUSE Apple Cinnamon candles, one for me and two for gifts.  Loved that the candles are made from soy not paraffin, have a cotton wick and mostly that $3 goes to support abandoned animals. ?üíó  Will be buying more candles in the future, thank you for the great product."
4,24-May-20,5,"delightful long lasting scent. I've been buying a lot of candles in the fresh linen,cotton scents looking for one that I could fall in love with andI finally found it!!!!!!! The LULU candle in fresh linen is now my FAVORITE.  The scent is clean and light and it burnsfor hours.  I will be giving these as gifts."
4,6-Jul-20,5,"nice cancle I got the Tobacco, Spice & Vanilla scent. It smells so good but the scent isn't strong. It takes a bit of burn time before I can smell anything. I might try another scent since the other reviews say otherwise. The size of the candle was smaller than I expected but it burns a lot slower than any other candle I've had so it was a bit surprising."
4,4-Nov-19,5,"Smells good..a little expensive for size Smells really good! I bought this because I liked the label of it compared to similar ‚Äúhappy birthday,‚Äù candles however I wouldn‚Äôt buy again because it was very expensive for a very little candle."
4,10-Jul-20,5,Birthday Candle I loved this birthday candle! I ordered it as a 21st birthday present for someone and she absolutely loves it! It smells exactly like a birthday cake and lasts a while without its wax spilling all over the place. It is on the smaller size so she is able to bring it up with her to college and use there as well!
4,20-Jan-20,5,Nice scent! Bought it first as a gift and bought the  second one for myself. Will buy a bigger size again.
4,21-Apr-20,5,Clean smelling candle This is a cute candle. Not super strong like yankee but smells nice and clean.
4,13-May-20,5,Must have candle! I received my candle almost a week ago and I love it! I was unsure of what scent to order but went with the lemongrass and it smells amazing! The candle seems to last a good while also because I‚Äôve burned it every night since receiving and I still have pretty much the full candle! I highly recommend and will be purchasing more!
4,8-Jun-20,4,"Smells great, basic packaging The most important things are that the candle smells great, the fragrance stays long after the candle is put out, and it seems to be lasting a long time.  At this price point, however, it would be nice if the glass container was designed to be aesthetically reusable, like as a succulent planter.  It's just clear glass so all you can do is recycle it."
4,12-May-20,5,"Such a nice scent! Never thought I would consider myself a candle snob, but I am.  This candle has a nice scent...not too strong in that it will give you a headache, but strong enough to fill the room and enjoy.  I've been super impressed with the quality and longevity.  I'm planning on buying more for gifts, too!"
4,30-Jul-18,1,No smell This candle had NO smell what so ever! Very disappointed.
4,18-Apr-20,5,Very Nice Appearance and Scent Love the appearance - very minimalist with the white and black label.  Scent is strong - maybe a bit too strong but the scent is pleasant.  Would be a great gift for both men and women.  Thank you for a quality product!
4,5-Jun-20,5,"Smells so good I want to eat it This is the third Lulu brand candle I‚Äôve purchased, and so far I‚Äôm loving all of them.  Passionfruit infused mango smells like the real thing - not perfumey at all.  Definitely planning to purchase more!"
4,28-Oct-20,5,"LONG LASTING AND SMELLS AMAZING! I love soy candles and could not believe how long this candle lasted!!! Don't let the size throw you off....these last a long, long time and smell absolutely amazing! I can't wait to try more!"
4,19-Jun-20,5,Will buy again Nice candle with a fresh lemongrass scent.Lasted a long time compared to chain store candles.
4,4-Sep-20,5,"Great Product! I absolutely love Lulu candles!  I have ordered two so far. The first was lemon and vanilla bean, and the latest scent was vanilla oak. They arrive boxed up very nicely with no damage to the candle. The candle burns well and the scents are wonderful; very fresh and smooth."
4,16-Apr-20,2,Not worth the money The flame on the candle never took off. The wax is not melting evenly and resulted in a pit in the middle of the candle. I let it burn for a number of hours the first night to give it a chance. Definitely not worth the cost. Got one for 1/3 of the price in a store that‚Äôs far superior!
4,17-Apr-20,5,"Like a Pineapple Oasis during Quarantine Am I in the middle of the wilderness? No I'm inside because I'm literally quarantined and the outdoors are forbidden. But seriously, this candle is an immersive experience. I can sit for hours and pretend I'm forest bathing with a drink in hand (which I pretty much do everyday now...minus the forest bathing). Overall, great candle. Wife is pleased."
4,14-Apr-20,1,"Faulty Candle I bought this on the recommendation of my boyfriend who has purchased this same brand before in other scents. While the wax seems to smell great, the wick will not stay lit. It barely ignites and then within 30 seconds the flame dwindles and it goes out. We haven't been able to get it to burn for more than a minute."
4,23-Jul-20,3,Just okay Seems like good quality but the scent per $ ratio is not good. Way too small.
4,6-Jan-20,5,Perfect for birthday gifts! Ordered a few of these for my friend's birthdays and they LOVED. Definitely recommend as birthday gifts. They smell really good too!
4,19-May-20,2,Won‚Äôt buy again Very small not worth the money ... yeah it smells good but so do the huge yankee candles for the same price.
4,8-Oct-20,5,"I would recommend this product to friends, long lasting great scent I would recommend this product to friends, long lasting great scent"
4,14-Jan-20,5,"Pineapple Evergreen is Awesome Smells better than I expected. These two scents really complement each other. Seems to be burning nice and slowly. It's definitely a very sweet smell, so I'd avoid it if that's not your thing. My apartment smells awesome."
4,6-Feb-19,4,"Smaller than expected, but still very satisfied.  Mouthwatering chocolate scent! This candle is smaller than I expected it would be, but it is slow clean burning which makes up for the size.  The candle is also wonderfully fragrant.  If you want your entire space to smell like chocolate,  this is the candle for you!"
4,25-May-20,5,My favorite scent yet...well worth the price point I was a little skeptical about buying these candles because the price point is on the higher end. They are well worth the money though and really long lasting. I also like that the case is thicker as I've found some to be too hot to the touch. The label is also very sleek and modern. Jasmine and Lilly is my favorite scent yet; I hope I can get this one in the 9oz soon.
4,1-Apr-19,5,Aroma is wonderful I use it in the early morning when I have my coffee and read the news. It sets the mood for a great day.I also give them as gifts. They make wonderful gifts.
4,29-Oct-20,5,My New Favorite Candles I love these candles.  They last longer than any candles I've ever used.  They come in a little box which makes for hassle free gift wrapping.  Treat yourself!  You won't regret it.
4,19-May-20,5,"Love the scent ""fresh linen"" Love this scent and also it is super cute candle!  I bought if for my fireplace mantle but ended up putting it on my kitchen bar.  The room smells great after on 5 or so minutes.  I will definitely be ordering more."
4,21-Nov-20,1,Not for people with allergies I was allergic to this candle. Got a sore throat the two times I lit the candle.
4,10-Apr-20,5,"Full Clean Scent with Wonderful Notes for Any Room This is my second Lulu candle - Amber Rose, and Sheer Musk. Wonderful scent. While it is not overpowering it is very fragrant and fills the room and adjoining rooms. The Rose note is not cloying or too floral. And the musk is full without being too heavy. Perfect for any room and will set a very clean pleasant atmosphere if you are going to be entertaining."
4,8-Oct-20,5,"Fantastic soy candle I am very sensitive to candles as they give me headaches, and so I look for soy candles. I came across these and decided to give them a try and I could not be more pleased. The scents were strong, but not at all overwhelming or artificial. I have been burning them everyday and they are still lasting longer than anticipated. I‚Äôll absolutely buy more from them."
4,6-Jul-20,5,"Wonderful, strong scent and slow burning This is an amazing candle. The smell of the cedar wood and mango together is strong and wonderful. It burns slowly which helps out the wallet and they‚Äôre pretty! I will have to try their other scents, but this cedar wood mango is so good."
4,29-Jul-20,5,My new fav scent Love the fragrance so much I bought one for a friend. Will buy several more for gifting.
4,21-Jul-20,5,Amazing! I‚Äôll start by saying I am very picky with candles. Mainly due to them not having a strong scent and my allergies. After 10 mins of burning the Amber Rose & Sheer Musk my entire apartment smelled lovely. The smell is strong and my eyes are screaming like other candle brands that are made with terrible products.It‚Äôs a must!
4,6-Sep-20,3,A wierd combination Smell was kind of weird but bought it because of the great  reviews
4,12-Nov-20,5,Great candle! I have always loved using candles. I love walking into a room That smells good. I just recently rescued a pitbull and wanted to get a candle that was pet friendly and a bit more natural. These candles are absolutely amazing! They last a very long time and they smell great! I am very happy with this purchase.
4,21-Mar-20,5,"Lasts long, smells great, worth the price I LOVE this candle! It lasts a crazy long time, and the scent is light and not overwhelming. I personally chose the vanilla bean and lemon and it is a perfect, clean scent. The packing is super cute, and very aesthetically pleasing to add a perfect touch to any room. I highly recommend this product, it‚Äôs worth the price."
4,16-Jun-19,5,"Great life and smell presence. Really enjoy the punch of smell these candles have. Not in an abrasive way, but in a gentle hug way. Fresh linen is a little more in your face, but very clean smelling. Pineapple Evergreen was perfectly fruity for the summer. Looking forward to trying more scents. Wish there were discounts on packs of 2 or 3."
4,11-May-20,5,"Distinctive sweet smell, Strong Pleasant Scent . I have been looking for a candle with strong smelling, pleasing scent. Thank you LuLu . I have now found it."
4,21-Jan-19,5,"Scent is amazing! The blueberry cobbler scent is DELICIOUS and I have already gotten compliments from everyone who has come over to my apartment since buying. It's too early to tell how long the candle truly lasts, but so far I have had a positive experience from only burning it three times! I know that I'd be interested in a larger version if available. Good stuff!"
4,1-Oct-18,5,Purchased September 24 and still going strong! Great scent to overcome my young GSD puppy! Looking forward to trying different scents but the Blueberry is outstanding!
4,17-Mar-19,5,"Fresh Linen. Love the smell, great product, ordering again. Bought the 6oz fresh linen about a half a year ago and now I'm running low and buying a second. I love the smell of bounce dryer sheet and this is similar. It's not too overpowering but definitely present."
4,12-Aug-20,5,"Scent ?üíØ Coming from someone who rarely can justify special purchases for myself, this is my exception. I constantly have 2-3 of the Amber Rose & Sheer Musk candles in my apartment. I love these candles. They are smaller in size but the longevity is there. This is my favorite scent I‚Äôve found in a candle. 10/10 recommend and continually buy!"
4,1-Feb-20,4,"Doesn't smell like other tobacco scented candles I've owned. Not that this candle doesn't have a great aroma but it doesn't have a strong or even slight tobacco smell. Its hard to find vegan candles so I hopped on this one immediately. Its a great smelling candle but just don't expect it to smell the way it is described. My brother said it had a slight hint of tobacco, but I can't smell it for the life of me. Still a great vanilla candle however."
4,27-Oct-18,1,Tiny Way expense for size...tiny
4,14-Oct-20,3,Scent great; longevity is disappointing. Like the scent lots. The candle burns down very fast. Not a good value for longevity.
4,28-Jun-20,5,Lemon Biscotti ‚ù§Ô?è These candles smell so good! Plus they‚Äôre soy which makes me happy and healthier for air quality.
4,24-Dec-19,5,"This candle goes further than any other. Furr a Cause candles are exactly what you‚Äôre looking for in a candle; distinctive, pleasant smell, long lasting, and helps provide dogs with homes. I can‚Äôt recommend this product enough now that we have three in different parts of our home to create a fully enriched ambiance of apple cinnamon during this holiday season. This candle is something every dog/candle lover would want!"
4,4-Oct-20,5,Love this candle I love this candle! I have purchased lulu candles before but the fresh linen is by far my favorite scent. It is worth it.
4,25-Jul-19,5,"Will not disappoint Omg what an awesome candle, I could not believe the beautiful scent and throw that this candle put out!!! Absolute must of a repeat buy! Great great great!!!"
4,2-Apr-20,5,"Beautifully Balanced Even balance of scent, leaning a bit towards jasmine, which is why I purchased the candle.  Fills the room with its beautiful scent, without fading as the candle burned down.  The jar is very clean in look and I'll use it post burn, looking forward to trying other candles once I burn through this selection.  Thank you!"
4,15-Jan-20,5,"Love this candel I ordered the Sugared Pecan scent and it is wonderful. I love the minimalist look of the candle itself as well as the scent. While it may appear larger in the photo than in person, it is slow burning and the smell is effective but not overwhelming. Will definitely order again!"
4,18-May-20,4,"Small but strong scented The smell takes over the room, I really like the lemon grass for a bathroom. Makes it fee extra clean! It is a small size candle, I do wish it was bigger for that price."
4,7-Nov-20,5,"Smells Good, Looks Good Everyone knows candles these days are just as much a home decor item as they are a fragrance. This candle looks great for the black and brown aesthetic of my at-home desk, which is why I bought it. It's just an added plus that it smells great too."
4,28-May-20,5,Good candles These are nice candles and make great gifts. The lemongrass scent has a little bit of a citronella smell but is nice for summer.
4,20-Apr-20,1,"No smell! The only thing this product got wrote was a long burn time. However, there is hardly a scent at all. I am the type of person who needs a subtle scent because it gives me headaches if too strong. This product had no scent, even when I literally put my nose inches away to smell it. I would rather pay the extra money for a Yankee candle that has a scent and long burn time than this."
4,22-Jun-20,1,"Not a consistent product This was my second purchase.  First candle was excellent.  Lasted weeks.  Second candle‚Äôs wick was short.  Could barely keep lit.  Would keep going out, had to keep scooping the wax out in order to light.  Wish this (the second purchase) candle was consistent as the first.  Love it, but at the price, can‚Äôt afford to purchase again."
4,7-Jul-20,5,Small but smells great I am always a fan of fresh scents and this one is very good.  Candle is fairly small but is lasting better than expected
4,6-Mar-20,5,"Smell mimics a coffee shop...yum!! Lulu‚Äôs coffee candle is one of the best, true scents of what coffee is all about! I burn it in my kitchen and can smell it throughout the house including upstairs. It makes my house smell like a coffee shop!!The only disappointment is that it doesn‚Äôt come with a lid or special box which makes it a semi bummer for a gift. I would also like a lid so dust wouldn‚Äôt settle in it."
4,27-Jun-20,5,"Incredible Candle I couldn't rate how long it lasted because I just got it. However, the moment I lit the candle, the fresh linen scent was present in my room. This is one of my favorite scents and I'm so glad this candle didn't disappoint. I can already tell the candle will burn properly, unlike some other cheap candles. I definitely will be getting more!"
4,4-Sep-18,4,"Excellent Quality Candle The quality on this candle is clear the moment you open the box.  It burns well, and i like that there's no toxic ingredients to worry about.  However, the fragrance i chose, Fresh Linen, is a little heavier than would be my ideal.  Hence, the knock of one star.  But that's really more a personal preference issue, and i wouldn't hesitate to try one of the other scents to see if it's ""a perfect fit"" for my home."
4,28-Dec-19,5,"Best Candles Yet! I did a search for the best natural candles, and Lulu came up...I decided to give them a try and am glad I did. They smell wonderful and come in quite a variety of scents. My son loved the blueberry cobbler, and the lemon biscotti was also great. Best candles I‚Äôve ordered thus far. Don‚Äôt hesitate to try them!"
4,5-Sep-19,5,"Long lasting and smelled great Was very pleasantly surprised by how much I like this candle.  I have received so many compliments on the smell of my home when I have it lit.  Seems pricey, but for how long it has lasted I would say it is a fair price."
4,26-Oct-19,5,?üòÅ?üíó Very good candles?üòÅ?üíó very strong and wonderful scent... lastme 24hts with constant burn. I probably get at least 2 a month.  ?üíó‚úåÔ?è
4,23-Apr-20,5,Perfect gift! My friend is a coffee lover! I gave her this as a gift and she loves it. Super cute; and smells wonderful!
4,24-Dec-19,5,"Love the scent When I burn this it makes the place smell warm, clean, and inviting. It is great for relaxing."
4,24-Nov-19,5,My wife is happy My wife loves the smell. It lasts much longer than traditional candles. It is a very convenient size.
4,19-Aug-20,3,too sweet Unfortunately this scent is a little too sweet for my taste...
4,20-Sep-19,5,Tobacco Spice and Vanilla - Excellent These candles are great! The scent is masculine and females also enjoy the scent. A perfect bachelor candle. They burn very clean and last longer than I had anticipated given the 6 ounce size. The scent is carries well thorough the room and home. I‚Äôll purchase again.
4,25-Mar-20,5,Yummy lemon grass Smells yummy.  Nice soy candle that burns clean.  Would make a very nice add on gift or stocking stuffer.  Will order again
4,21-Aug-20,2,"Does not smell like espresso It smells EXACTLY like a tootsie roll, so if that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre looking for you‚Äôre in luck."
4,7-Jun-20,4,Subtle The container is simple and elegant. The scent is very subtle but nice.  Id like the fragrance to be a bit stronger.
4,5-May-19,5,"Beautiful smell and simple design This candle gives off a very strong and balanced, but not overwhelming smell. I‚Äôve only burned it for a total of two hours so far, but it has barely made a dent in the wax. I think this candle will last quite a while.I love it!"
4,7-Jul-20,5,Strong smell Pineapple evergreen smells so great! This candle is awesome and makes my large living room smell great.
4,2-May-20,4,"Pricey but great smell Great smell! Tropical but fresh. But I was surprised at how little it was, especially for the price."
4,24-Aug-20,5,Sexy man is sexy I ordered the SexyMan for my basement/office and is great. It is smaller that I thought but It smelles good and strong enough to put off enough scent for the entire basement. I recommend and for sure I will order more.
4,23-Jul-20,5,"Great Smell, Nice candels On the small side but appear to be really good quality candles. Pleasant smell."
4,16-Sep-20,5,"Scented Satisfied I love the candle. Yes, it's not big and makes the entire room smelling like heaven! The scented I picked is not overpower and will not give you and your guests a headache. Highly recommended. :)"
4,18-Jun-20,5,"Smells amazing Loved it!! Yummy scent, strong in a good way. I kept the box too(empty box smells wonderful too) Thoughtful presentation. I will definitely purchase again. Made me smile when I received it ;0)"
4,17-May-20,5,"Perfect Candle I LOVE this candle! I got the Jasmine, Oud, and Sandalwood Soy candle and it smells so homely and luxe. I really dislike those artificial sweet ‚Äúsugar cookie‚Äù candles and find they give me a headache. This is so beautifully fragrant, but not overwhelming and burns beautifully. I definitely can say this is a long burning candle. Can‚Äôt wait to buy more!"
4,2-Sep-20,5,"Clean burning and fresh smelling candle! Really nice, clean burning candle with a fresh scent!  I bought one for my Mother-in-law as well.  I am so happy that the scent.  I plan on buying some fall scents when the weather turns!"
4,27-Mar-20,2,The candle doesn‚Äôt burn very well I just started burning the candle for the first time and it is barely staying lit.  It has been burning for a while now and cannot seem to create a real flame
4,17-Jun-19,5,EXCELLENT All Natural Candle I truly love this candle. The lemon grass smells so fresh in the house. The candle lasts a while too! You can tell it was made well. The company is a great USA business. Definitely buying more!
4,17-Jul-20,5,Best scented candle I've found! I found out about this brand from being over my friend's house and noticed the amazing smell from one of his candles. I was so impressed I bought the exact same one that day. It smells great even when unlit. My only complaint is that it does seem to burn quickly (or maybe I just keep it lit too long for the smell??).
4,16-Jun-20,5,"Lovely Scent, Medium Throw These candles are not only lovely to look at, they also smell fantastic. I would say the throw of them is average, nothing that will scent your whole house but enough to create a nice subtle aroma and take out any unpleasant smells in one room. They burn slowly with a HOT flame and last a long time! Big fan!"
4,6-May-20,4,"Best smell - pineapple evergreen I got this candle today and it‚Äôs awesome so far. I wanted a new candle since the bath & body works ones are way too strong and give me a headache. The scent isn‚Äôt overpowering and is nice and refreshing. I wish I would‚Äôve read the product description more, as the candle that I got didn‚Äôt come with a lid."
4,4-Apr-20,1,"Barely burns The candle smells hardly burns the wick is so short and it goes out on its own. I expected it to be more fragrant based on the reviews. You can only catch a whiff of it if you‚Äôre standing right next to it. I‚Äôm disappointed because I love the scent, it would have been nice if it actually made my living room smelllike it."
4,10-Feb-20,4,Good candle buy. Candle is lovely. Nice fragrance. Burns well.This is my favorite (lemon vanilla). I‚Äôve also tried black tea and sage for cooler weather.
4,8-Apr-20,5,Esthetics + Scent Top Notch I am a CONSTANT candle burner. These are some of the best! I have the hardest time finding espresso / coffee candles which are my favorite. This one (besides just having it) is fantastic! For an extra treat I got the Amber Rose + Musk - stunning. Never smelt a scent quite like it. Both fill my apt. Don‚Äôt forget to trim your wicks! I will be purchasing again.
4,27-Aug-20,4,"Nice, but strong This is a really strong candle! It smells clean, like soap and fresh laundry, which I like... but it‚Äôs really strong. I burned it for a couple hours last night and it barely made a dent, so I feel like it‚Äôll last awhile. Overall, a little pricey for the size but I might buy again. Just an easy candle to burn while I take a bath with my evening wine."
4,18-Nov-20,4,"Great for a cute gift Bought this candle for my friend. A little pricey for a 6oz candle but I figured it was furr a good cause - pun intended. The candle smells nice. Apple and cinnamony, reminds me of the cinnamon pine cones they sell at the store. Overall it‚Äôs not the best candle ever but I would probably purchase another one if I needed a cute gift."
4,11-Sep-20,5,"Great smelling, long lasting candle Really pleasant smelling candle. I use this in my home office throughout the day and it gives off a very nice scent. You can smell it a little ways away and the scent seems to stick around for an hour or two after blowing out the candle. Also a very nice looking candle that has a ""modern"" feel to it. Will definitely purchase again."
4,22-Jan-20,5,Smells divine! This is my second candle (Sexy Man hahah) and I also have Fresh Linen. These both smell incredibleeee. I have 4 cats and like to light the candle both for my pleasure and to help mask some smells that inherently go along with owning cats. I love that these candles are soy. Very cute and I'm very happy with them!
4,25-May-20,5,"You must purchase this candle! I guess you could say that I‚Äôm a candle snob. I‚Äôm tired of paying money for candles that have very little scent, or way too perfumey, burn to fast, or smoke upon distinguishing them. This candle is perfect. Looks nice, burns slow and even, love the scent and burns clean. I will definitely be purchasing more!"
4,7-Jun-20,5,Smells wonderful This was a birthday gift! They loved it and let it immediately. They said it smelled so good!
4,29-May-20,5,"Long Lasting. Great Smell. headline says it all. the shipping was fast, well packaged to prevent the glass container breaking, and the product is great. The Espresso Bean scent is a perfect way to start the morning as well as to unwind and relax at the end of a long day. Definitely recommend! Will be trying additional scents in the very near future."
4,2-Apr-20,5,"Lovely scent This candle has a perfect light fresh and clean scent to it (great for people who don't like overwhelming smells), and comes in a really cute jar. Would recommend and looking forward to trying their other scents."
4,21-Feb-20,5,"An excellent candle at a fair price This candle is the best!  I like ve everything about it and have ordered the Pineapple Evergreen twice. The scent is aromatic, without being too strong. This candle is every bit as  good as the pricier brands I have previously indulged in. I am about to place another order!"
4,18-Feb-19,1,"Honestly, way too strong I love the smell of coffee, but this candle literally made the entire apartment hallway smell like super strong expresso, and that was when it was on my porch in the packaging. When i opened it, i was overwhelmed with the smell. Way too strong and needs a cap. Even then, the smell leaks out because it is so pungent."
4,20-Jul-20,4,Smaller then I expected It's a nice little candle I thought it would be bigger but its nice.
4,2-Oct-20,5,"Not to strong - just the right amount of scent! I got the Fresh Linen candle and it has the best scent! Very clean, and not too strong like some other brands, it burns low and slow and puts off just enough scent"
4,2-Sep-20,5,"Love it! Such a unique scent, love it! The pineapple comes through as very fresh, and the evergreen is very mild, making it tough to identify as a pine scent. I am very particular with scents, and this is a new favorite of mine. Wish they offered a big version and some wax melts for warmers!"
4,14-Mar-19,5,"COFFEE LOVERS DREAM If the smell of espresso coffee is what you're looking for this is the candle. 1 candle is enough for 700-800 cubic feet, that's about the size of a small 1 bedroom apartment. 2 candles will fill a 1,500 home. I've lit it for a couple of hours and then blow it out. The smell of coffee lingers, so the candle lasts about 1-2 months."
4,20-Oct-20,5,Gift little candle! I gifted this to my husband as part of his 10th anniversary gift. He loved and I loved it too! It smells great and it is lasting a long time compared to other candles I have purchased. I will definitely be buying this brand as gifts again in the future.
4,9-Mar-20,3,"Great company. Poor choice of scent. Still love the company. This, however, is not a giod scent. For sexy, go with Amber Musk."
4,2-Feb-20,5,"Lasts forever and smells great! Bought 2 candles back in November and can't even review the 2nd one because the first has lasted me so long! (it's February now!) The Tobacoo, Spice, and Vanilla smells great, especially for the winter. I started getting these candles after I got them as a gift. Definitely worth the price, especially knowing that the candles are made of soy, which is healthier than paraffin."
4,11-Aug-20,5,"Rich, long lasting smell and well worth the money. Absolutely love the smell of this candle. Has soon as I opened the package I could smell the candle, most candles I have purchased have not had this strong of scent it fills my home which is what I was looking for, I might add this is my first soy candle and my only candle from now on. Just a expensive long lasting smell."
4,11-Sep-20,5,Really good scent My wife loved it and I believe it was fairly priced we love it
4,12-Sep-20,5,Smells fresh and pleasant Very nice. It also makes for a nice gift for any occasion.
4,11-Nov-20,5,"Subtle, earthy aroma This order received well-wrapped and quickly! The scent is subtle, floral and herbaceous. Highly recommend for earth signs!!"
4,16-Apr-20,5,"Amazing product, fragance and values! Got the apple cinnamon candle as a gift for my fiance and she loved it! It comes in a nice quality candle jar and the fragrance is the perfect combination of the sweet and sour. It also has a cute label stating part of the income is going to an animal shelter for rescued animals. Also, it's vegan! I really like it and I highly recommend it. Five stars!"
4,19-Jun-19,5,It‚Äôs abyummy smell Pineapple evergreen smells wonderful! It‚Äôs very small for the price and there‚Äôs no lid so it wouldn‚Äôt make a good gift but I like it
4,19-Jun-19,5,"Lovely, long-lasting scent. This is my second purchase of this candle. I love the soft scent, which fills the room, along with the very reasonable price. It comes nicely wrapped in its own box with tissue - a great gift. Really glad I found it."
4,10-Jul-20,5,Smells lovely! It's a lovely smell and strong enough to emanate the scent across the room!
4,3-Nov-20,5,Pineapple evergreen is the only candle you‚Äôll ever want to burn. Someone gave me the Pineapple evergreen as a gift and I fell I love with this scent. I bought more for myself and to give as a gift. They burn slow! I have no complaints about this product or the shipping. It arrived the next day & was carefully wrapped with tissue paper as well as packing paper. I highly recommend this product.
4,11-Nov-20,1,"Pass on this product GreetingsWhile packaged fine, the candle arrived open with no cover to protect the scent.I would have returned it but I had already tossed the shipping box ."
4,24-Nov-20,5,"Best smelling candle,PERIOD! This is the BEST smelling candle I have ever used! I wish I would of found them long ago... but I did now and I am so happy. As a travel rn, I like to have a little bit of me in my hotels so this is a wonderful way to.do it!"
4,8-May-20,5,"Alluring and pleasant scents I enjoy these candles immensely. Other candles may be cheaper, but the quality of these candles shines through. I took a chance on ""sexy man scent"" and ended up loving it. I love the smell of my sexy man, and this candle is a pleasant reminder. the ""Vanilla Oak"" candle is the rights amount of smoky meets sweet. It draws you in."
4,29-Jun-20,4,Smells good!...but... Smells good! but it has more of a sweet cologne scent if that makes any sense. Its not going to smell like my hoodies drenched in cologne lol if that is the type of scent you are going for. Overall still smells good and would recommend it.
4,14-Mar-20,4,"Above average Looks great, perfect size.  The scents are bit strong for my taste."
4,29-Dec-19,5,"smells amazing!! this is my first time trying a lulu candle but i have heard great things about them. they smell amazing and natural, which is what i always look for. so far ive been burning mine for at least 2 hours a day for the last week and i still have a ton left to burn! cant wait to try there different sents."
4,20-Jan-20,3,"Underwhelming scent. I love Lulu candles, but the Vanilla Oak scent is very underwhelming compared to other scents I've purchased."
4,17-Oct-20,5,Very good scented candle I purchased the Linen-scented candle. It arrived on time in secure packaging. The scent was soothing and last-lasting; it was such a great purchase. Highly recommended!
4,9-Jul-20,5,Smells so good I really like the smell of this candle. I will be purchasing more!
4,19-Nov-20,5,"Awesome, highly-scented candle! The scent of this candle is amazing.  It's a nice fragrance that would be enjoyable for everyone.  This candle burns slowly, so it'll be around a while--that's a good thing. Even when it's not lit, the fragrance permeates the room it's in. My only wish was that there was a nice cover for it, but overall I'm well pleased and would recommend it."
4,1-Apr-20,5,"Best. Candles. Ever. I consider myself a candle connoisseur and have bought or been given everything from Dyptique to Lafco, Nest to Goop.  I was looking for a soy candle and came upon Lulu's.  Where have you been all my life?  Gorgeous scents, long clean burn times and great price.  Obsessed!"
4,17-Nov-20,5,"Very stylish and smells great! I'm very happy with this candle! I was looking for a laundry scent and it smells just right. I also love the stylish text on the front of the candle. I'll be giving it as gift, and I think anyone would love it!"
4,14-Nov-20,5,Smells beautiful. This candle smells beautiful. It shines beautifully in my living room. I am really impressed with the strength of the aroma from such a small candle.It burns slowly as well. I allowed it to burn for about and hour and a half and didn‚Äôt even make a major dent when I blew it out.I would purchase another.
4,15-Jul-20,5,"Heaven scent Lulu‚Äôs jasmine, oud, and sandalwood has just become my new favorite candle. The scent fills a large room nicely without being overwhelming. My only regret is that the candle isn‚Äôt bigger. Not sure if Lulu‚Äôs makes a bigger size, but I‚Äôll be buying it if they do."
4,6-Jul-20,4,"OK I got this for a gift. It smells great, is smaller than I expected but ok."
4,18-Apr-20,5,Smells great.... Wife loved the candle. Most soy candles we have bought it the past don‚Äôt smell as strong. This one has a great scent and made a nice gift.
4,5-Aug-20,5,Obsessed Not too soft and not too overpowering. Really great scent and candle. Have had it burning for about 3-5 hours a day the last week and it's still about halfway through. Love it.
4,27-Jul-19,4,Beautiful candle I love the look of this candle. Linen is actually not my favorite scent but I still like the candle because it‚Äôs made of natural ingredients and has a clean look to it. Makes for a great gift too!
4,27-Feb-20,4,"Great smell, especially great value for the money. Hard to find soy candles under $20 that are actually decent, this one has a nice clean smell. Mild downside is that lemongrass naturally smells a little bit like some common cleaning products, but this one is sweet/light enough that it largely is able to avoid confusing you. I also kind of wish the lid was metal/screw on, but that's a minior gripe. Recommended!"
4,26-Dec-19,4,Strong espresso candle Love this candle! It has a very strong scent so if you live with someone sensitive to smells this may not be right for you. It smells amazing for those of you who love coffee and espresso scents! I wish It came with a lid but other than that it‚Äôs a perfect gift!
4,24-Apr-20,5,"Black Amber and Sexy Man! Who can pass them up...Black Amber and Sexy Man! Great names, of course, but with accompanying great, long-lasting fragrances. If you like candles and enjoy their pleasing ambiance in these stressful times, you cannot go wrong with LULU!"
4,21-Oct-19,4,Great Candle! I love the smell of this candle and it seems to last! The only reason that I gave it four starts is that it is VERY strong. I can smell the scent throughout my house when I really only wanted it for the living room.
4,3-May-19,5,Summer time at the beach house The scent reminds me of summer time at the beach house ( in my dreams of course) if I had a beach house I'm sure it would smell just like this. You won't be disappointed
4,26-Jan-20,4,"Perfect scent These candles really are great. I got the tobacco vanilla and pineapple evergreen. Both scents are fantastic and do a great job of filling the room with a subtle aroma without being overpowering. I can't speak to their longevity as I just bought them, but they've gotten everything else really right. I'm already thinking about which ones to get next!"
4,1-Nov-20,5,The only candle for the rest of my life I love the scent of this candle. Hands down the best espresso/coffee smelling candle. Not too sweet like all the others. I legitimately live in a coffee house now lol. The glass jar itself is also pretty cool. It‚Äôs like a matte black frosted look.
4,14-Oct-20,5,My favorite candle ever Might be my all time favorite candle. Burns forever and the aroma of the black amber is wonderful. I have many more scents in my cart now and will be spending another $50+ just to try more scents.
4,20-Apr-20,4,"Smells great, did not come with a lid Smells great, just like fresh laundry! It‚Äôs perfect for a small gift.  The only downside is that it doesn‚Äôt have a lid so I had to use  an old lid to put it out."
4,13-Nov-20,4,Strong pure coffee scent This is exactly what I was looking for- truly coffee smell not a sweet fake smell of coffee. My only complaint is that it is almost too strong and stays strong for days after you burn it. That‚Äôs not necessarily a bad thing unless you don‚Äôt want it to ALWAYS smell like coffee.
4,13-Aug-19,1,"This candle was clearly used. Typically these candles come in a cardboard box, but this one was in a plastic bag and was clearly used. I love these scents. but am not interested in buying products that say they are new and were already burned."
4,24-Jun-20,5,"MY NEW FAVORITE CANDLE!! I used to be all about the bath and body works candles until I came across these soy candles. I could actually smell the ‚Äúsexy man‚Äù scent through the box! It burns long and slow, and isn‚Äôt overpowering. Looks like I know where to buy my candles from now on."
4,3-Jun-20,5,My new brand! Love love this candle.  I'm sold! Lulu is now my go to brand. Scent is calming and nice.  Burns slowly/Long lasting. I do not cough as I usually do with other candles.
4,5-Feb-20,2,"Candle Very strong floral scent. It seems, much to my allergies dismay, to burn for a long time."
4,27-Jan-19,5,"Burns evenily and smells lovely I love scented candles, but it's important to me that the scent is strong and it burns evenly so that no part of the candle is wasted. So far, this candle does both. It's not the most expensive candle I've owned, but it's not inexpensive either. Still, you get what you pay for. I'm hoping this candle continues to be worth its price. So far, so good."
4,21-Sep-20,5,"One of the best scented candles I've owned I wasn't sure what to expect from the Sexy Man scent, but after I opened it up, it was the type of scent I was looking for. It is a very smooth scent that isn't overbearing. I've found that a lot of different brands tend to be too intense and end up making the room uncomfortable, but that isn't an issue with Lulu Candles. Highly recommend!"
4,25-Oct-20,5,Absolutely amazing scent This is the best smelling candle I‚Äôve ever bought. It‚Äôs so true to the smell listed (I got espresso bean). It truly smells like a coffee house. Super impressed and will buy from here from now on.
4,6-Oct-20,4,"Love! The smell is so good. Mainly got it to try and seeing all the great reviews! I would gift this to all single gals! I like a little more manlier smell like teakwood, but really love it!"
4,19-May-20,5,"Smells great Smells great, lasts a while. Smaller than what I thought but turns out, size doesn't matter"
4,10-Aug-20,4,very heavy scent very thick scent. Fills the entire room with a great scent
4,14-May-20,5,Worth it I really like LULU candles pineapple evergreen & wild lemongrass smells amazing fresh linen not so much plan on buying some more different scents.
4,28-Aug-20,5,"Excellent Value I bought this candle for my home office where my dogs like to spend the day lounging while I work. I have burned this candle for over 8 hours already, and it barely even appears to have burned down. The scent is great, and not overpowering. All in all, I am very pleased with this purchase."
4,8-Jul-20,5,lovely scent Such a lovely scent. Fills the house with a fresh citrus smell
4,31-May-20,5,"Lemongrass scent works great outdoors! I ordered the lemongrass scent.  I purchased it for my coffee table but after getting bit by mosquitos while sitting on the deck this weekend, I took it outside for our patio table.  It really did the trick!  No more mosquito bites.  The candle seems to be slow-burning, barely leaving an indention in the wax each time I burn it."
4,3-Jul-20,5,"Perfectly balanced. While I do gravitate more towards smokey scents like tobacco, at times they can be overbearing. The warm spice and subtly sweet vanilla support the earthy tobacco scent profile in a non-cloying manner. At first burn this became one of my favorite candles. I cannot wait to burn the others."
4,7-Jun-20,5,Very cool Very cool last a long time. The scent is amazing I loved the pineapple pine! The jasmine Lilly is great too. Ships fasts and doesn‚Äôt leave a Smokey after smell once put out.
4,27-May-20,3,Not a big candle but scent is beautiful For the price it's a small candle the scent is beautiful but it's just not big candle
4,5-Nov-20,5,"Super cute, ships well, reusable jar! Love these candles, and send one as a gift. It didn't break either times in the mail. The glass jars are so cute with fun lables and if you melt the wax out of them, you can reuse the jar to store things like q tips! It lasted for a very long time and the smell filled the whole apartment."
4,16-Nov-20,2,Do not recommend. Really could not smell any scent once it was lit.
4,12-Aug-20,5,Great gift Got this as a gift for my friend- she absolutely loved it!
4,30-Sep-20,5,Perfect for relaxing Scent of this candle is amazing! I love soy candles since they tend to last longer and this one is great! Such a fresh smell (I got the fresh linen scent). Would recommend.
4,8-Oct-19,2,Disappointed Didn‚Äôt care for the scent. Wish I could return.
4,14-Oct-19,5,Delicious smelling candle I could smell this candle before I even opened the box. The blueberry smells amazing! Will def be ordering more!
4,21-Apr-20,4,"Small but mighty! Overall, very small but powerful candle! The scent is off to me, idk how to explain it other than just slightly off. Not in a bad way, it has definitely not stopped me from burning it! It‚Äôs very cute and burns for a looooong time. I light in the morning and don‚Äôt burn it out till I start cooking dinner and repeat the next day!"
4,12-Dec-19,2,Nothing but a Candle Not anything special and certainly dont smell much of a scent. Just a small candle.
4,9-Jun-20,5,Burn Baby Burn long lasting! This candle burns very long and the scent is wonderful. The tobacco notes are stronger than expected but pleasant.
4,1-Nov-20,5,Espresso scent will change your life!!! Insanely delicious. Everyone needs the espresso scent in their lives. It smells like the most delicious coffee shop lives inside your house. Hands down my absolute most favorite candle I have ever had. Can‚Äôt wait to order it again and try new scents!
4,24-Apr-20,3,"I Expected More I was looking for a candle in between my cheap Marshall's candles and a Nest. I choose this one because of the reviews. It didn't last a super long time and the smell is pleasing, but not lingering. I don't like super heavy smells but I want something that lasts. Will not buy purchasing again."
4,11-Mar-20,5,"Love this candle! I wasn't sure what I'd think about this candle since it's name wasn't a well-known scent, but I totally love it!! It's very unique, but just what I was looking for. I'll definitely be trying out more scents!"
4,1-Mar-20,5,"Love the Scent! I am usually a ""fresh"" scent kind of person and steer away from fake fruity smells.  I love pineapple, though, and decided to give this a chance based on the reviews.  I am glad I did!  The evergreen scent balances the pineapple well.  The pineapple is natural smelling and not overly sweet.  I'd definitely purchase again."
4,22-May-19,5,"Great scents good value Powerful scent from these candles. Definitely a good value and the Amber, sexy man, and pineapple.scents are all great. Will buy more."
4,4-Jul-20,5,"Delightful scent; slow burning; worth the money Lovely scent; fills up a relatively large space but isn‚Äôt overpowering at all. 6oz for the price initially may seem a bit much, but this candle does burn slowly. I kept it for myself, but one could confidently give this as a gift and the receiver would probably enjoy it very much. I‚Äôve already purchased the 9oz option in the same scent!"
4,3-Jan-20,5,"Best. Candle. Ever!! I love the scent so much!! I‚Äôm in love on not only how cute the packaging is but the scent is amazing once it‚Äôs burning. I got so many compliments on the smell, and also how long it lasts, I keep it burning almost all day. Will be purchasing many more :)"
4,6-Oct-19,4,Perfect candles I love lulu candles. The espresso bean is my favorite I‚Äôve bought it 3 times. It fills the room but not in an overpowering way. I went with the sugared pecans for more festive season. Still a great candle the scent just isn‚Äôt a strong as the others.
4,1-Jun-20,5,BEST FRESH LINEN SCENT This is honestly the best fresh linen scented item I have ever purchased. The scent is very present without being overpowering. This is the exact candle I had been looking for for a while! I loved the Fresh linen candle so much I went back and bought the Pineapple Evergreen scent---that one is so amazing too. Such an unconventional combo that smells amazing! :)
4,18-May-19,5,Smells amazing! I got the fresh linen scent and it smells awesome.  I have an open kitchen with very tall ceilings and it still makes the whole area smell great!
4,5-May-20,5,"Strong, beautiful scent I got this for a friend because the scent was screaming her name. It has been a month and she hasn‚Äôt even lit it yet because the wonderful scent fills up her bedroom. She claims it is one of the best candles she‚Äôs ever owned!"
4,13-May-19,4,Smaller than it seems It‚Äôs cute for a gift and the scent is nice but it‚Äôs way smaller than I expected. I had to buy something else to compliment the gift.
4,10-Jul-20,4,Impressed I ordered lavender musk and it smells lovely! Strong scent but not overpowering. I wish it lasted a little longer and was a little cheaper but I will definitely repurchase and try other scents!
4,12-Nov-20,1,"Does not stay lit. I bought this candle because it had great reviews. It smells good,  but it does not stay lit. Poor quality.  Very disappointing."
4,13-Feb-20,5,"Love this candle Amber Rose... I love this candle. I will keep buying. Scent is amazing! Many compliments and not overpowering. This particular one was bigger, love that. It did not come with a lid, but description already revealed that upon ordering. Scent lingers and last a long time. Thank you for great customer service!"
4,24-Jul-20,5,the scent is heaven I love love love this candles. I have bought 6 or 7 0f these  the aroma is not overwhelming and my house smells so fresh and good. I will keep buying these
4,13-Jan-20,5,"I have a new favorite!! I have loved candles forever, and when I decided to go with soy I have not gone back to my 'other's.This fragrance is long lasting but not too strong.I am very happy with how long I can use my favorite scented candle."
4,6-May-20,5,Like scent of clean laundry? Then must have. Exactly what I was hoping for. Clean and light linen scent that Is not overpowering but still strong. Highly recommend it. Will definitely be a repeat costumer.
4,21-Aug-20,5,"Most amazing smelling candles ever ‚Äî so worth the price!!! I absolutely LOVE these candles. They last so long and smell so fragrant. The Jasmine, Oud & Sandalwood is my my favorite scent, it's great for setting the mood if you're taking a bath, engaging in massage, or just relaxing and reading. I will not buy any other candles!"
4,16-Jul-20,5,"A very pleasant scent with a good longevity Opening the candle, I was a little bit surprised. Contrary to other candles I purchased in the past, the scent was not strong at all... but it comes as soon as you light the candle up. The scent is really pleasant and stay even after you stop using the candle. A very good purchase."
4,13-Apr-20,1,Zero Scent I was excited to try a new product and spend more than I normally would. After fighting to open the lid I lit it. It‚Äôs been burning for over two hours now and I have noticed zero scent. I‚Äôm very disappointed in this product and would not recommend it to anyone.
4,8-Jul-20,5,"Great Candle for the price! This candle is perfect for anyone on the market for a good smelling, long lasting candle. I ordered the 6 oz. in the clean linen smell and it is phenomenal. I would recommend to anyone who is a sucker for good scents and  a fresh clean smell. I will soon be trying out other scents after this one is through. I would recommend 10/10!"
4,21-Jul-20,5,"Simply the best candle for candle lovers! I love candles and have purchased just about every brand offered at amazon and Lulu Candles is by far my favorite. I've purchased both small candle bundles and at least a dozen medium sized candles. Every scent is my favorite but right now I'm loving ""Wild Lemongrass"".  Also, the candles themselves are beautiful!"
4,11-May-19,5,Get the blueberry or linen one. My mom loved these candles and ever scince she passed away I burn them in rememberance of her. I love how strong they are and they last a while for them being on the smaller side.
4,26-Mar-19,5,Girlfriend approved Just got this for my girlfriend who is a candle snob.  Only the best for my lady!!  She loves it and I will definitely be getting more!  These will always be in my wish list.  Thanks so much for making this awesome product.
4,7-Jul-20,5,"Smells Incredible and Lasts Forever! I saw a friend's review of this candle and decided to order one myself. I'm SO glad that I did! Not only does it smell incredible, but it lasts WAY longer than most candles do. The Black Amber scent especially is so calming and relaxing. It's officially become part of a wind-down ritual to light before bed. I would definitely recommend this candle!"
4,3-Dec-18,5,"Scrumptious!! I have purchased five of the Pineapple Evergreen candles... and evidently they are popular because I haven't been able to snag a large one! These smell delicious without being overpowering.... Burn evenly, and the packaging is clean/modern. If you are a ""candle person,"" (and you know if you are.... ) Try these!"
4,10-Jun-20,5,Smell's great! The candle smells great and arrived without any damage and as described. Thank you!
4,30-Sep-20,5,"Smells amazing! I love this candle, I got the Pineapple Evergreen scent and it's my new favorite. The smell is strong enough to notice but not overbearing like some candles I've used in the past. The packaging is beautiful - highly recommend!"
4,9-Mar-20,5,"Love this candle Great candle, smells wonderfulExcellent gift item"
4,7-Feb-20,1,Disappointed My candle came today and it had no lid too it and the pieces were broke all inside the box definitely not happy
4,28-Jun-19,5,"Ideal and Easy Gift for ANYONE! I purchased these candles as a gift for my clients. The branding is high end, the size is perfect (not too small), and the price is just right. Also, I'm super particular about aromas, and these were light and refreshing, not overly sweet or pungent. Really pleased - will buy more! Great for client and professional gifts!"
4,30-Mar-20,5,Great candle I love the fragrance I bought the Pineapple Evergreen and would definitely repurchase it!I only wish the candle came with a lid.
4,24-Sep-20,5,"Good quality candle I was initially looking for a fall scent, but then came across this candle. I read the reviews and everyone seemed to love it, so I ordered it. It‚Äôs perfect! It‚Äôs on the small side, but it seems to be a very high quality candle! Thank you!"
4,27-Oct-20,3,"Scent is ""meh"" I was expecting a better scent. It's just ""Meh""."
4,6-May-20,5,Long Lasting and Better than Expected The candle exceeded my expectations and was a great addition to my house. Filled all the rooms and branding was great. Perfect gift as well.
4,21-Jun-20,5,"The Pineapple Evergreen smells amazing! I can‚Äôt speak for the longevity for the candle, but the smell is amazing! Very unique and delicious smelling candle. I will buy again just for the scent alone.It‚Äôs smaller than I expected, but with the way the scent fills the room, it far exceeds the Yankee candle I bought."
4,26-Oct-20,5,"Smells so good, seems long burning lemon and vanilla compliment each other so well, love that its cozy with vanilla yet clean smelling with lemon. Love that the wick is 100% cotton too.  The wick doesn't produce a big flame so it keeps the wax around it melted but doesnt burn through it super fast.  I've only used it a couple times but seems like such great quality!"
4,13-Jul-20,3,Unfortunate scent I got the nag champa scent. I was hoping it would smell like nag champa or wood or a head shop. Instead it smells like baby wipes. I thought maybe I should burn it and it will smell good. It smelt like burning baby wipes.I was pleased with the size and how strong I could smell it when it was burning.
4,3-Apr-20,5,"Scent is amazing I got the Jasmine, Oud, and Sandalwood scent and it is perfect. Not too strong but fills the room. Burns slow, great product."
4,6-Aug-20,5,"Strong scent! I ordered the Cedarwood Infused Mango scent and I LOVE it. It has such a strong scent while burning (which is hard to find in a soy candle in my opinion) and I can even smell it when I have it open on the table without it lit. Definitely worth it. Especially for the price! The design of the candle is cute, too which makes for a perfect gift!"
4,22-May-20,5,"Smells amazing! At first I thought this candle was going to be a dud. It was smaller than I expected and when I first lit it; the scent was pretty faint. Once it got burning I was quite impressed! (Little candle, big impression) I am a bit of a candle snob,  and I think this tobacco spice candle is amazing. LOVE this scent!"
4,5-Oct-20,4,"Great smell, but small It's a small candle for the price. Smell is great! Love the company's mission. Giving for a house warming gift."
4,26-Jun-20,5,Smells amazing This candle smells amazing!! And the packaging is so cute!
4,15-May-20,5,Greatest little candle ever! The scent is wonderful. I will be ordering more of these.
4,15-Oct-20,4,"Smells delicious but it's small This candle smelled like you were baking a cake in your kitchen.  Smells awesome!  It is on the smaller side, though."
4,5-Jul-20,1,"NOT WORTH IT AT ALL 20$ for a tiny ass candle. lesson learned, never buy candles online. congrats it‚Äôs hand made and in the US but i know wax isn‚Äôt that expensive. there‚Äôs a huge vat at your little factory and i know it‚Äôs not 20$ for 8oz or whatever minuscule quantity is in this thing."
4,6-Apr-20,5,"Great scent! Really glad that this is a clean burning candle with no black soot residue. The sweet pea, jasmine & apple scent is not too strong and has smooth scent for the kitchen when I cook. I recommend this scent for those that prefer light and fruity scented candles. Will definitely try more of the other scents from Lulu Candles!"
4,5-Jan-20,5,"Worth the price! The Apple Cinnamon scent is wonderful and fills a large room, despite it's small size. I love this candle and immediately ordered two more. Blueberry Cobbler is also quite good."
4,24-Jun-20,5,Pineapple Evergeen Fragrance is amazing Second time purchasing the pineapple evergreen scented candle and i think it's my favorite candle of all time. The fragrance combination of pineapple and evergreen is perfect somehow and it travels pretty far throughout my apartment. It's a little pricey but worth it!
4,14-Jan-20,5,"Pretty, great smelling candle I gave this to my friend for her bday. She loves the scent! Smells just like Birthday cake!"
4,18-Apr-20,5,"Best candles I‚Äôve found on here so far! These are my favorite candles right now. I have bought them several times and the quality is consistent and excellent.Highly scented and long lasting, I recommend"
4,28-Apr-20,5,"Very fragrant! This candle actually SMELLS Good. While most candles you buy usually ‚Äúsmall‚Äù great, you can usually hardly smell them if your face isn‚Äôt pressed up against the flame. This is the opposite, someone walked into my home and instantly said ‚Äúit smells good‚Äù this fragrant candle really fills up spaces!"
4,19-Sep-19,5,"Yummy smell Oh my gosh!!  This smells SOOOO good!!! Fast shipping, beautifully packaged and perfect service."
4,14-Apr-19,5,"Smells amazingb I got the pineapple evergreen unsure of how it would smell, but my god it smells amazing!!I‚Äôll be buying more! Can‚Äôt go wrong with this."
4,30-Mar-20,5,"Phenomenal Candle! Got it for a birthday gift for my husband and he loved it. He could smell it through the package and wrapping. We don't know about longevity yet, as we haven't burned it yet, but for us personally I don't see it lasting long as it will probably be burned a lot. Needless to say it was a hit!"
4,3-Sep-20,5,Smells soooooooo good!! This candle smells sooooo good!! It burns for many many hours. I have ordered 6 more!!! Guests in my home love the aroma!!
4,1-Oct-20,5,"Incredible scent! I love these candles. This is the second one I have purchased. They are strongly scented and will fill a room with their scent. I was very impressed at the strength of the scent, it is not subtle.  They seem to last for a while and burn cleanly. I will certainty buy more of them!"
4,18-Aug-20,3,"Review products and receive a free candle - a lie Now that I have been using my candles for a week. I can honestly say, the wild lemongrass are better but these candles burn too fast and it doesn't come with a lid to seal and preserve the scent. Doea not have a durability."
4,22-Jul-20,5,"The Perfect Candle Honestly I'm extremely picky when it comes to candles and this exceeded my expectations. The scent is potent but not overbearing- warm and comforting ( Ordered Tobacco, Spice & Vanilla for the room) and the soy wax lasts forever.. This candle is the epitome of quality over quantity.. worth the value, would highly recommend."
4,30-Aug-20,5,Fresh-Baked Blueberry Bliss This candle fills your home with genuine bakery-scented goodness.  My only word of caution is that guests may expect dessert after a delicious whiff or two!
4,18-Oct-20,5,The Scent is Devine Just used it for the first time today and omg I'm in love! The pineapple evergreen scent is definitely for every tropical fruit lovers out there.
4,3-Jun-20,5,"Excellent smelling candle, I got lots of compliments on this one. Excellent smelling candle, I got lots of compliments on this one. I would recommend this candle."
4,15-Sep-20,5,"Burn for hours These candles burn for hours at a time in my house, thank you WFH, but they last so long! Seriously, if they were Yankee, they would be completely burned down by now and they are maybe 1/4 of the way burned down. The smell is light in that its not overwhelming but you can definitely smell it throughout the house. Will buy more!"
4,25-Sep-20,5,"Smells Amazing! I got the scent ""sexy man"" looking for something different than my usual fruity or sweet scents from places like BBW. Literally so amazing. The smell is so good straight from the jar and I am so excited to light this during the upcoming cool fall nights! And it came so quick! Will probably be purchasing a new scent very soon :)"
4,31-May-20,2,"Nice smell, too small for price Smells good, definitely too pricey for the size.  It's tiny!!"
4,16-May-20,5,"Scent I wanted a candle that burned clean. I didn‚Äôt necessarily want a scent as it can sometimes be bothersome. However, this lemon grass sent is amazing. I bought two and once these are gone I‚Äôm definitely going to buy exactly the same thing. This would definitely make a nice gift. Highly recommend!"
4,26-Mar-20,5,"Smells wonderful! I love soy candles because they don't leave a residue in the air. The 6 oz candle is really small, but it packs a big punch with the smell (I purchased the lemon and vanilla bean and it smells amazing!) and it will burn for a long time.  I like it so much that I just purchases another one!"
4,11-Sep-19,4,"Good throw, need scent descriptions! I bought the pineapple evergreen based on the rave reviews, but I don‚Äôt get any fancy interplay - to me it really does just smell like pineapple evergreen and is too sweet. If you like sweet, you will like it. I prefer midnight in paris. But either way, the throw of Lulu‚Äôs is really good for a soy candle, I just wish the company gave descriptions of the scents."
4,14-Apr-20,5,"Sweet smell - not perfume-y Bought as a gift for the wife. I dont normally buy scented candles online in fear of being too ""perfume-y"" but this one is perfect! Smooth sweet smell. Not perfume-y. It's a little pricey for the size but worth it considering we cant browse candles in person right now!"
4,26-Sep-20,5,Fresh agreeable scent Such a nice scent I ordered a second one!
4,16-Apr-20,5,"Good Candle I've purchased a few of these and they are by far the strongest smelling candles I have purchased on Amazon. The jasmine and oud candle is my favorite so far. Most recently tried the sexy man. Although I hate the name, its a sweeter smell than the oud candle. Will continue to purchase these candles."
4,19-Oct-20,5,"The most calming, take you to your comfort zone candle!! I‚Äôm disabled, and a friend had given me this a couple of CHRISTMAS‚Äô ago. I found the combined scents to be extremely calming. This candle has excellent longevity. This is something that I would love to be given at least once a month!!"
4,11-Apr-20,5,"Great scent The instant I lit this candle, the scent emanated from it. Not too heavy, kind of delicate, but definitely pleasant.  Will order again. And these would make great gifts."
4,27-Jun-20,4,"Great Candle! This is a great candle! It smells a little perfumey to me, but that might just be the particular scent I chose. It should be noted that my boyfriend (who usually hates candles) really likes this one."
4,29-Jul-20,2,"Poor quality wick Due to the poor quality wick, it doesn't create enough heat to melt any of the wax, and it keeps putting itself out.The candle smells fine, but barely any of it has burned off because the wick won't stay lit, and when it does its a small flame with little heat."
4,7-Aug-20,5,Linen scent spot on! As always lululemon candles deliver. A true lovely linen scent and clean burning and lost lasting. Once you purchase these you can't buy any other candle.  linen scent is sublime ?ü§ó I am a forever fan
4,26-Jun-19,4,"My favorite candle! This candle smells amazing! Wild lemongrass isn't to strong, but just right. Smells citrusy with a hint of sweet, which makes the room smell fresh! I like how the container is modern and simple. I want more! Would've given 5 stars, wish it would've been a little larger since I like it so much."
4,27-Apr-20,5,"Great smelling unisex candle I purchased the jasmine, oud, & sandalwood candle.  I'm a male, living alone, and this is exactly what I was looking for in a subtle scent that wasn't overly feminine or florally smelling.  I can not speak to the longevity as I have just recently received it but it certainly smells great and would definitely make a nice gift."
4,15-Jan-20,2,"Amazing scent but ‚Äútunneled‚Äù I‚Äôve bought candles from this company before so I‚Äôm not sure what went wrong, but my candle started tunneling from the very first burn :( It was super disappointing especially given how amazing this candle smells!! Maybe it was just defective or something but I definitely did not do anything to cause it to tunnel like that!"
4,13-Oct-20,5,Fresh linen is amazing!! Love the sent is very refreshing and not to over powering! I love it this is my 4th purchase already because the candle literally freshens up the entire room and is always being used because the smell is lovely! Highly recommend purchasing these candles ?üëç?üòÄ?üòÄ?üòÄ
4,24-Dec-19,4,"amber rose musk scent is sooo beautiful. just wish it wouldn't turn black inside and mushroom. But the burntime and the fragrance is beautiful, perfect scent mixture."
4,26-Feb-19,5,"Wonderful candle! If you've never owned a soy candle, you don't know what you're missing. These last a long time and the ones from Lulu Candles have a subtle, yet surprisingly powerful, scent. I went with the fresh laundry scent and have been very pleased. The scent is actually authentic, not like those over-the-top cheap candles that overpower your senses. You'll pay extra for these candles but IMO, they are well worth the extra cost."
4,14-Jun-20,1,Becareful! Dissapointed that I paid $20 for a candle that got so hot at the bottom is burned through my table. Very scary. I have used dozens of candles and never had this happen. It was so hot that it shattered when I tried to move it.
4,9-Oct-20,4,"Decent choice for the price Good smell, easy gift for family, will likely buy again"
4,17-Nov-20,5,"Long Lasting I've never had a candle scent last longer than an hour, let alone over 12. I lit my Tobacco and Vanilla candle in in the evening, blew it out before bed, and the next morning still noticeably smelled it in my room and down the hallway. The scent was noticeable and not overbearing, just really excellent. Will be getting more!"
4,24-Jul-20,5,"Great Candle!! I have to be totally honest when I say I'm more impressed by this candle than the ones I purchased from B&BW. I did get the 6oz just to try out,  but it fills the room better than candles twice the size and price.  The tobacco and vanilla is great and can't wait to try out another scent."
4,11-Aug-20,4,Nice candle This would be a great little candle for a gift! Great smell :)
4,21-Jun-20,4,"Awesome fragrance! This candle had a very nice clean fragrance ( Ocean Breeze) . I know I purchased the one without the lid, and it arrived well packaged. But, if I were to give this as a gift, I would have liked a lid. Great product overall."
4,17-Aug-20,5,"Great gift Bought as gift, told it smells amazing"
4,21-Apr-20,5,I Love It! I really like this candle and the smell is so wonderful! The vanilla oak is so fragrant and calming. I burn this candle almost every day for at least an hour and I still have so much candle left to go! It really is so nice and cute looking. I bought this for myself but it would be an amazing gift for someone else!
4,17-Jun-20,3,Pineapple/Evergreen Scent too sweet I thought the evergreen would cut the pineapple scent but it‚Äôs too sweet for me. Had the candle burning for 2 hrs today and it is burning slowly. Would try a different scent more my style.
4,9-May-20,5,"Safe scent! Scent is a beautiful strong, yet subtle combination.  Very appealing, and not too strong."
4,31-Jan-20,4,"Wonderful scent I received the Pineapple Evergreen and it smells great, without even burning it. Very excited to try out soy for the first time."
4,26-Sep-20,5,Great candle Great candle! Absolutely love the scent!
4,16-Jul-20,5,Perfect Love this candle. Smells great and long lasting.
4,20-Feb-20,5,"Great scent! I need to start by saying I'm NOT a candle girl.  But.... the suggested smells intrigued me.  I first bought the 6oz size to test it.  Six weeks later, I came back for the 11oz size (which is actually a much better price/volume).  (I also think the 11oz size is more aesthetically pleasing in its gold-tone case and without a lid.)  It's a keeper!"
4,12-Oct-20,5,"Nice gift and scent The scent is very subtle and accurate of ""fresh linen"". I bought the candle as a gift and rounded out the gift box. The size and burn time was average for a candle of this size. The friend liked the scent and burned it for a while in their home."
4,16-May-20,2,Tiny Very tiny candle. Too small for the price.
4,20-Nov-20,5,"Pleasing smell, pleasing aesthetic, pleasing packaging...A+ Haven't burnt this candle all the way down yet, so I'm unsure as to its longevity, but so far so good! Really pleasant (though not overpowering) aroma, and the piano-black glass holder is classy/complimentary. The packaging makes this a VERY giftable item, and came as a pleasant surprise! I'll definitely be ordering again."
4,7-Aug-20,5,Smells great! Smells very good and is a good size! Will definitely buy this candle again
4,3-Jun-19,5,The scent carries throughout the house I absolutely love love love my linen candle!It‚Äôs spreading throughout my home. I‚Äôve referred it a couple times already lol
4,3-Apr-20,5,Great scent! I have a small house but the throw on this candle is great! I can smell it at the other end of my house (30 ft away). I got the passion fruit infused mango and I love the scent. I can‚Äôt speak to the longevity as I just received it yesterday.
4,1-Aug-20,5,Smells PHENOMENAL This candle is so cute and quaint! Smells AMAZING!! Lights up the house with such a gorgeous scent! Will definitely have to buy more!
4,9-May-20,5,"Legit candle with smell Out of all the candles I tried, this is the only candle that has most smell when burnt. Will never buy another candle again."
4,24-Jun-20,5,"Amazing!!!! Highly recommend!!! i‚Äôm not normally one to order candles online, but I came across the lulu candles and I had to try it. it was the best decision!! the lemongrass smells amazing & the candle truly lasts so long!!candles i‚Äôve purchased at other stores seem to burn a lot quicker. highly recommend!!"
4,18-Jun-20,5,GREAT PRODUCT. WHAT A FIND ON AMAZON. A SWEET PRODUCT FROM LULU CANDLES THAT I HOPE EVERYONE GETS TO TRY TODAY. VERY NICE!!!
4,11-Jul-20,5,Worth it! This candle is so great! I bought one for a gift for my friend and she loved it! We got the Furr A Cause candle which donates $3 to helping rescue abandoned animals. It smelled amazing and it is great to know where the proceeds are going. The scent wasn't too strong and I will probably be buying more from this company!
4,11-May-20,5,Smells SO GOOD! This candle smells incredible! Who knew pineapple and evergreen went together like peanut butter and jelly? Y‚Äôall will not regret this purchase! I think this would make an amazing gift as well! Five stars all around!
4,27-Jun-20,3,"Possibly defective wick This candle doesn‚Äôt burn well for me, may be due to the wick on this one. It has a small flame, only melts a small circumference and has very little throw of scent.  I got a different scent of this candle and have no complaints... burns and smells wonderfully."
4,17-Jul-20,5,"Must buy Beautiful wonderful scentMy husband noticed the scent immediately, very aromaticBetter than the typical apple cinnamon scents u usually buy"
4,22-Oct-20,5,Rich Scent / Smells AWESOME !!!!!! Smells AMAZING !!!!  Will order this item again !!!!
4,13-Apr-20,2,"Disappointing fragrance very mild I wanted and expected a strong coffee scent, like espresso should be.  I'm very disappointed, this candle fragrance isn't what I expected and not worth the money."
4,21-May-20,5,"Fab candle!!! Most beautiful candle. Presented in a beautiful jar! The scent is amazing! Very fast shipping, excellent service."
4,10-Sep-20,5,Scent is wonderful This candle smells so good I bought the apple cinnamon one.  It fills the room with awesomeness
4,11-Oct-20,5,Loving It The simplicity of the candle is what really drew me to make this purchase. I love the scent of the Lemon Vanilla it is muted without hurting my nose. This makes a great gift and excited that I made this purchase can't wait to try other scents!
4,9-Apr-20,5,"Not super big but smells super good! The size was a bit smaller than I expected, but it smells amazing! I'll definietly be getting the pineapple evergreen again."
4,14-Jun-20,5,"One of the best candles out there I've ordered several of these candles and have not been disappointed.  They burn cleanly and fully, and I've been pleased with every scent I've tried.  Looking forward to trying other varieties."
4,10-Sep-20,5,"LOVE this candle I was skeptical of the Pineapple Evergreen scent, but it has quickly become a family favorite! I have reordered this candle several times to give as gifts as well. The scent and burn time are comparable to candles I have spent at least twice as much on. Nothing but good things to say about this purchase!"
4,23-May-20,4,"Sexy Man The candle itself is good quality -- a bit pricey for the size, but good quality. The scent I got is a very comforting, cozy scent. I would recommend if you like ""masculine"" scents, but it's not fresh and clean it's more warm and inviting."
4,16-Oct-19,5,"Pricey but nice Not big enough for the price, however it is very scented and has lasted slightly longer than most. I burn a candle daily for several hours a day and it seems to be withstanding that. Love the scents!"
4,7-Apr-20,5,"Incredible fragrance I got the espresso bean scent as a gift for a friend. And honestly, I'm incredibly jealous now because it's one of the best smelling candles I've ever smelled. I also really enjoy coffee so maybe I'm biased. What more motivation do you need?! GET ONE"
4,17-Jul-20,5,Great Gift This is a great and personal gift to give anyone and it is inexpensive
4,4-Apr-20,5,Great scent Spot on scent. Absolutely love this candle.
4,22-Apr-20,5,"Just what I wanted! Smells great, looks good! I can't wait to get more!"
4,30-May-19,5,"Waking Up In Your Favorite Coffee Shop Every Morning Being someone who suffers from caffeine intolerance, I was more than delighted to find this candle. The smell of freshly grinded beans filled the room even before I opened the package. There's nothing artificial about the scent, but purely smooth, creamy, and indulgent. Put it on your nightstand, so that you'll feel like waking up in your favorite coffee shop every morning."
4,11-Jul-20,5,"Great, quality candle I got this for my fianc?© because he loves candles and he LOVES this one!! Definitely buying more!"
4,24-Dec-19,5,Best smelling candle Ever I was majorly surprised of the scent of this candle. I'd buy this any day over a over 20 dollar bath and body works candle.Best value luxury candle on Amazon. I highly recommend the Fresh Linen Scent.
4,13-Aug-20,5,Jasmine Sandalwood = yay The Jasmine Sandalwood is so great - perfect combo of a bit sweet and a bit earthy. Strong scent (which I like!); I have a one-bedroom apartment and it fills each room. Love!
4,1-Jul-20,5,"Great scent Fresh linen is a very nice scent, great for my master bath"
4,5-Aug-20,5,"great giftable candle I tried several coffee scented candles, and was on a mission when I ordered this.  The container was so cute, great scent, and lasted a long time.  It would make a great gift."
4,3-Feb-20,5,Love it. We got the brown sugar one and it smellsSoo good! We recently had a pipe leak in the apartment so the carpets were wet for a while and smelly. This helped mask the smell for when we have people over. We‚Äôre going to try a few different smells.We also love how it‚Äôs made from soy wax!
4,23-Jul-20,5,Good little candle Great scent of lemon grass.  Takes a while for the candle to scent up the house.
4,13-Nov-19,5,"VERY SCENTED I bought the Happy Birthday candle scented buttercream vanilla cupcake for my daughters birthday, and it was wonderful!!! Smells just as you would expect it to. For only being a 6 oz candle it has a very strong scent to it and doesn't burn fast! Overall i highly recommend this candle and cant wait to try other scents!"
4,4-Aug-20,5,Nice candle I have never purchased a candle without smelling it but gave it a try and I am very happy with this candle. Smells great and burns a long time. I purchased the lemon vanilla scent. Not overly strong but definitely fills the air with a pleasant scent.
4,24-May-19,4,"Smells Amazing! I love the smell of this candle! Unfortunately it came without a lid the second time I ordered it, which was disappointing. But a very nice candle overall."
4,14-Jun-20,5,Definitely won‚Äôt be sorry! Just received this the other day and am super impressed with the quality! The lemongrass scent exceeds my expectations and is making the entire kitchen smell awesome. Love the look as well and will definitely purchase more of these!
4,6-Mar-20,4,Love the scent I received this product yesterday and it smells amazing. Even my picky husband loved the smell of the Jasmine & Lily scented candle. I love that it is a soy candle and it burns for a long time. At first the wick kept going out but that is a given with candles. Will def be purchasing more in the future.
4,7-Jul-20,4,"Good scent, finished too fast I like the scent but it burns too quickly. Doesn't last long. Also too expensive."
4,12-Apr-20,5,Yummy smelling Bought as a present and my wife really likes the scent.
4,25-Nov-20,5,"Yummy scent.  No calories, lol Giftable......great way to say Happy Birthday!"
4,28-Jun-20,5,"I love Lulu Candles! Lulu Candles have a great scent, longevity and are totally giftable! I especially love the lemongrass scent! I bought 3 of them!"
4,11-Sep-20,5,"Long lasting, clean flame! I buy a lot of candles because I enjoy lighting one every night. This has become my favorite brand! It's slow burning so it lasts an incredibly long time, but the flame is still bright and scents the room nicely. It's also made of soy wax with a 100% cotton wick, so the flame is clean and never smoky."
4,28-Jan-20,1,Do not waste money Do not buy this candle. Do you self a favor and go to Home Depot and buy an Off candle tub. This is the worst candle I have ever bought in my life and that includes buying an off candle tub. It is just a little bit larger than a tea candle. The smell is horrific. I am a candle aficionado do not waste your money.
4,29-Apr-20,5,Luxury without costing a fortune Loooooove this scent! I was so ready for something luxurious as a treat during self isolation and this candle delivers without the sticker shock of some other candles. It's light enough that it doesn't give me a headache and the packaging is chic. I'd definitely purchase again!
4,23-Jun-19,5,Smells fantastic. I have bought a few candles from this company. Always high quality. This one smells amazing. One of my favorites.
4,27-Mar-20,5,"The most heavenly scent of all time Wow. Just wow. This scent checked all the boxes. Clean, fragrant, a bit of musk and leaves your nostrils with a sweet lingering touch of fresh cut roses. The amber is strong yet supple and the sheer musk could've been sheen and as soft as velvet. I will be reordering in a much larger size and posting this on my social, mattbmer."
4,9-Jul-20,1,"Great scent but shattered glass. This candle arrived completely shattered, the tiny box was crumpled. There was no protective anything covering the candle. So disappointed because this was intended to be one of my husband's birthday gifts. Otherwise, we love the scent of these candles."
4,15-Nov-19,2,Pledge with lemon scent..... With apologies to those who enjoy the scent of Pledge with Lemon.....  very overpowering.....  Pros:  is a slow burn... a good thing. Cons:  seems many of these lemongrass scents are WAY too strong.....  I have more than a few candles from this company which I totally enjoy......  this is not one of them.
4,11-May-20,5,"Smells delicious! Small candle but the ""Fresh Linen"" sent smells absolutely delicious! I will probably be getting another one as soon as this one is done."
4,17-Oct-20,4,"Good Looking Candle - Not overpowering smell Good Aesthetics, girlfriend likes the look.Espresso Bean smell is Great. Rich non tacky scent.Does seem to be slow burn."
4,19-Aug-20,5,"Smells Great! I got the Brown Sugar and Oud, and it smells great! The scent is refreshingly light, but I could still smell the candle before I even fully unpackaged it! This candle smells amazing and I would 10/10 recommend to anybody wanting a sweet yet woodsy scent!"
4,9-Nov-20,5,"Amazing Smell, Seems to be Long-Lasting The pineapple evergreen candle smells amazing, which surprised me based on the scent combination. I purchased this after reading similar reviews and was not disappointed. I've used the candle a few times so far and imagine it will last at least 40 hours."
4,3-Aug-20,1,Lasted Less Than 3 Days Such a small candle for the price. Lasted LESS than 3 days with average use. Shocked how small it was although the description said 6oz.
4,8-Feb-20,1,Not good Almost no scent at all and won't stay lit. Very disappointed.
4,26-Mar-20,5,"One of the best candles Iv'e ever lit I got the Blueberry Cobbler (6oz) candle. I was a little scared to purchase at first since it was pretty expensive, but it burns very well and the smell is not too overwhelming but not too weak either. Also Im a new customer to amazon prime and it came the day after I ordered it!"
4,29-Oct-20,5,A Clean Fragrance A Pleasant clean fragrance. Not overwhelming. Would purchase again. One for me and one for friends.
4,7-May-20,5,Best Coffee Smelling Candle! I've tried to find this scent with so many different candles and they've NEVER come close to how good this one smells.  Very strong scent and lasts a long time.I haven't tried any others but with over 6K reviews I feel confident the Coffee scent isn't the only one I'll purchase.
4,6-Oct-20,5,"Great fragrance, long lasting burn. I have bought the jasmine, oud and sandalwood 7 times and not disappointed - this candle has a lovely fresh fragrance that isn‚Äôt perfumy and has long lasting burn. One 9 ounce candle can scent a 2 story home effectively for several weeks!"
4,13-May-20,3,"Great smell, but the quick burn makes the price point questionable I love the smell of this candle - clean and light! However, I lit it for the very first time 1 hour ago and there's already significant part of the wax gone, and it's burning in a hole/ not evenly distributing, which will cause all of that surrounding wax to eventually be wasted. For the price I paid for this candle... I'm disappointed."
4,5-Oct-20,3,Very tiny flame Seems like a nice candle but somehow defective. I can barely see the flame. I‚Äôd love to return but I just don‚Äôt want to deal the return process. Plus it‚Äôs kinda small size and not really worth the price so overall I‚Äôd not rebuy and would not recommend.
4,2-Apr-20,5,Great Candle! I have bought a number of candles in my day and these candles are amazing!  The scent is awesome and the price is right!  I have since bought 4 more and intend to use them as gifts too.
4,14-Jun-20,5,"longlasting and smells heavenly at first I thought this was a lot of money for a relatively small candle, but it has lasted SO long and smells up the entire house when I light it!!! 1000% worth the money. The Fresh Linen scent is so clean and fresh smelling. So relaxing on a Sunday evening. Definitely will be buying more very soon :)"
4,14-Aug-20,5,Wonderful Scented Candles! Lulu Candles smells amazing right out of the box! I ordered Fresh Linen and Pineapple Evergreen. I would highly recommend this product. The candles were packaged in a cute box (perfect for gifting). I will definitely be ordering more and trying out the other scents!!
4,18-Mar-19,5,"Nice, light scent The Wild Lemongrass scent is nice and refreshing but not overpowering. I really like this candle and think it's worth the cost."
4,24-Mar-20,5,great smell! candle smells great and lasts a long time
4,16-Jun-20,5,"Slow burning and amazing!! This really is one of the slowest burning candles out there, which makes it so great. They have so many wonderful scents. This one is nice, feminine and floral. The coffee one is amazing too."
4,17-Jul-20,5,"Great candle ! OMG, great smelling candle!We got 5 dogs , once you light the candle it just smells devine throughout the whole house .Going to order more ."
4,26-Sep-19,5,"beautiful to look at and smell LOVE this scent.  Came well packaged, and looks beautiful.  Could not ask for more."
4,1-Nov-20,5,"Excellent Quality I absolutely love the fragrance. The candles are long lasting, I use a warmer and I'm able to reuse 1 candle over and over..."
4,11-Jun-20,5,"Reasonably priced, great smelling candle Stuck at home during quarantine and noticing my house doesn't always smell amazing! The Sexy Man candle has solved that. I love the spicy, cozy smell that reminds me of my fiance's cologne. This scent is great for winter or summer. You can't lose! Very happy with this purchase and will be buying again when it runs out."
4,16-Apr-20,4,"Burns clean, great scent distribution throughout the house! I bought the Furr a Cause scent and it's a really cozy, warm smell--reminds me of an apple cinnamon kind of fall smell, but much more natural and enjoyable of a scent than your typical candle. While the flame stays pretty small, I  am super impressed with how long-lasting this candle is!"
4,2-Mar-20,1,"No scent at all. Don‚Äôt buy, over priced Waste of money, does not have much of a scent at all. Way over priced"
4,13-Sep-20,5,Would buy again! Love the scent and high quality!
4,11-Jul-19,5,Smells just like a birthday cake Good birthday gifts
4,30-Oct-20,5,"My New Favorite Candle! There is nothing like the smell of coffee and this candle totally hits the nail on the head.  It gives a wonderful aroma that lasts, I loved it so much I bought another one for a different room in my house! I lit my candle in the morning and it smelled like a fresh pot of coffee had been brewing! Highly recommend."
4,19-Jul-20,5,Outstanding Awesomely good product and great service
4,28-May-20,5,"Don‚Äôt judge a candle by its size I will admit I was a little disappointed when I saw the size of the candle; HOWEVER, I was not disappointed with how slow burning it is!! It will last you longer than large candles so don‚Äôt judge by the size. Smell is great, not too overpowering but can smell across the room. Smells likes sandalwood men‚Äôs cologne but softer... great gift!"
4,7-Apr-20,5,aroma is amazing This candle is amazing. i have a hard time trying to find a candle with just the right coffee aroma.  The espresso bean candle is it.  It is the same scent you smell when you walk into a store that sells coffee beans.  delivery was in a day or two.I love it...will be ordering more....thank you Lulu candles
4,11-Oct-19,5,"Good deal and nice scent Have not burned this candle for long, so can not attest to longevity, but great scent!"
4,27-Feb-19,5,Bergmont Infused Jasmine Simply fantastic.  The scent is relaxing and rich but not overwhelming.  I will definitely be purchasing these again in the future.
4,25-Feb-20,5,Love this scent! So unique. I was unsure about this scent - such a unique combination! - but the other reviews said great things so I gave it a shot. I absolutely love it! You can smell it almost instantly which I love and it seems to be burning slowly despite me using it for several hours at a time. Will definitely repurchase!
4,13-Sep-20,5,Fresh roses This has the most perfect rose scent. It‚Äôs strong and fills my entire apartment. It‚Äôs also an overall pretty looking candle. I will definitely need more once I burn through this one!
4,1-Apr-20,5,Good candle I forgot about it and kept thinking that my house smelled so clean! It definitely has a pleasant scent but it reminded me of Febreze a bit which I don‚Äôt love. It‚Äôs smaller than I imagined but seems like it burns slow and will last a while. Overall I‚Äôm happy with the quality.
4,19-Sep-20,5,Buy it!  You will love it! I just love this candle.  The smell is strong and delightful!
4,28-Apr-20,2,"Meh Really cute LOOK of the candle, kind of iffy / fake fresh scent. We use it outside for ambiance."
4,30-Aug-20,5,"Long-Lasting and ""Clean!"" I wanted to find a healthier alternative to normal candles - with the benefit of a candle that was longer lasting. While I haven't had my candles for long (I got the two-pack of lemongrass), I am shocked by how long-lasting they are already. I am really pleased with this purchase!"
4,14-Nov-20,5,"Super Cute for Friends I got this for my best friend as a Christmas, and the first comment was that she loved the scent and how cute it was. The one thing that I note about all products that are shipped is the amount of packing used. The candle was smartly packaged and I did not worry about it breaking."
4,8-Sep-20,5,AMAZING We love the pineapple evergreen! We are trying the lemongrass now!
4,28-Dec-19,4,The smell is great but not real strong. The smell is great but not strong. It burns clean and slow.
4,2-Dec-19,5,"Small but Powerful The candles are a little smaller than I expected, but last a while and are very scented.  The fresh linen makes my condo smell wonderful and I will try additional scents."
4,8-Sep-19,5,"Best candles ever! Excellent product. I will definitely order more from this company, and in other flavors/scents too."
4,18-Oct-20,1,Not very fragrant. Not very fragrant. Sitting in a small room I can‚Äôt smell it at all.
4,15-Feb-19,3,Nice look Looks great and might work well in a small room. I placed in my living room (about 400 square feet) and couldn‚Äôt smell it at all.
4,16-Oct-19,5,"quality candle i will be purchasing more candles from this company. got the jasmine, sweet pea, apple and evergreen pineapple candles and i am very impressed at how the scent is able to to fill our apartment very well. the only downside is that the candle was smaller than i was expecting."
4,15-May-20,5,"First time buyer and will be buying more! This candle has a strong but not overpowering scent. We keep it in the center of our kitchen table and it looks tasteful and classy. A great option as a gift as well, housewarming, etc. Never have I purchased a candle online before (because I always want to smell them first) but the reviews spoke for themselves!"
4,2-Aug-20,5,Smells great Smells amazing! Loved this scent. Made a great housewarming gift for my friend.
4,28-Jun-20,5,Smells fantastic I got this for my friends bday because she loves candles and what better than a bday candle. I ordered chocolate and no kidding i thought their was a box of fine fresh chocolates hiding somewhere. The smell is amazing. Great gift idea. Hope she loves it. I sure do
4,12-Dec-19,5,BEST SMELLING CANDLE I first got this candle as a birthday present and it made my entire bedroom smell so nice. its hard to describe the scent. its sweet but not too sweet. It brings me back to my childhood. It reminds me of those cupcake dolls from the 90's.  I had to order more for the rest of my house and i ordered extra for christmas presents! I LOVE THEM
4,14-Jun-20,5,"Birthday giftable This candle smells so good, I want to eat it. Lol"
4,15-Sep-20,3,tiny small -especially for price
4,3-Sep-20,2,Not A Strong Scent Not WorthIt The scent isn't very strong
4,19-Apr-20,3,Expensive lovely smelling candle Loved the scent; it was spot on! Thought the price was exorbitant for the size of the candle. I haven't burned all the way through the candle yet so am hoping the product claim of one of the longest burning candles on the market is correct because then I'll feel better about the price.
4,26-Dec-19,5,"Amazing scent! We ordered this candle as a gift and as soon as it arrived and I opened the outer  packaging, I fell in love with the scent! (The candle was still boxed up... I just opened the bag that it was mailed in and instantly knew I would be ordering another one for me to keep!) It‚Äôs that perfect ‚Äúcoffee aroma‚Äù!!! Can‚Äôt wait to try other scents!!!"
4,23-Jul-20,5,Great Quality I like the unique scent of my Pineapple Evergreen candle.  I actually noticed it at a friend's house and bought one for myself.  It burns nice and slowly so I won't have to replace it quickly.
4,14-Apr-20,4,"Sexy ""Tropical"" Man - OK but not for the price The candle is smaller than I thought it would be.  It had a very nice smell but more tropical than ""sexy man"".  The smell disperses through a large room nicely but burns quick. Since working from home, I had it burning for 8 hours for about 3 days and the wick burnt out with about 5/8"" of soy wax still at the bottom."
4,13-Dec-19,5,Smells great I just love this. I got it for my daughter on her birthday and she love it too. It smells great too.
4,13-Sep-18,5,amazing!!! These candles smell great and are not overwhelming!!!!!  LOVE them.
4,24-Jul-19,5,"Smells great! These candles smell fantastic. Highly recommend the Tobacco, Spice & Vanilla. It's subtle but amazing smelling"
4,19-May-20,5,Smells amazing! Little candle packs a big punch in terms of scent! Would definitely buy this again. I got the lemon biscotti one which smells like Christmas and something we can all use right now :)
4,14-Aug-20,5,"long lasting I was pretty surprised actually with this candle, it does give off this manly scent which is very good when you have company ;) It is also a slow burning candle,  which makes this candle last much longer than other candles on the market. highly recommend."
4,26-Feb-20,1,too small smelled really good but so tiny for the price :(
4,21-Mar-20,5,"Excellent candle Awesome candle. Great scent, lasts several hours. We'll be buying more."
4,18-May-20,5,"Smells Amazing I absolutely love the lemongrass scent. The candle is a little small for $15, but the amazing scent makes up for it. I like the simple black and white aesthetic as well."
4,9-Nov-18,4,fresh linen scent great but the price is not. Love the scent! The price is too much for the small size.
4,28-Aug-20,5,smells great! This candle smells so good! It smells similar to LeLabo Santal26 but for a much better price! I am a huge fan of the LeLabo candles and this is a freaky close dupe. It also still looks polished and looks nice as an accent on any shelf or ledge. I would definitely rebuy once this one burns out!
4,28-Jul-19,4,"Smells awesome The candle smells awesome. You can smell it before you take it out of the box. The smell weakens after a little while, or maybe I got used to it. Would buy again"
4,22-May-20,5,Amazing smell! Can't get enough of it I was gifted one of the Sexy Man candles. The scent is incredible I can't get enough of it. I then went and ordered another one for myself because the gifted one burned pretty quickly but that was probably due to the fact I was using it a lot haha. 5 stars!
4,29-Oct-19,5,Great gift Super cute gift. Comes in a nice box ready for gifting. Smells amazing.
4,7-Nov-20,4,"Sweet Coffee Smell Smells more like a caramel coffee. I was looking for more of a pure coffee bean smell, so I'm not too into this candle but it's still definitely a good one if you like this type of smell. Looks really nice to keep out."
4,18-Jan-20,4,"Nice  candle I bought a few for gifts, and ended up keeping one.  It smells great, not too strong. (I get headaches from a lot of strong smells, but not this one.) Burned evenly for several hours. I will order more."
4,22-Nov-20,5,Great quality Love the small of this candle
4,25-Sep-20,5,So cute. Love this sweet bday candle
4,4-Jul-20,5,Pineapple Evergreen... sounds iffy but the result was amazing! This candle has an amazing scent. As a man this candle has a welcoming scent that is sweet but grounded in a woodsy smell. This will complement any kitchen living room areas of a mans house. This  is by far my favorite scent so far!
4,1-Jul-19,5,Smells good lasts long.  Very cute Smells very good and clean.
4,24-Sep-20,5,"Jasmine, Oud, and Sandalwood! I lit the candle right after I received it. The smell is not overpowering but soothing. I have been wanting oud and sandalwood fragrance in my place and I found what I like!"
4,30-Sep-20,5,"THE BEST SCENT! This is officially my new favorite candle. I already pre-ordered three more. Also, it definitely last longer than it says because I have been burning it for at least 6 hours a day every day for two weeks."
4,16-Jun-20,3,"Smell isn‚Äôt right for the description The scent is not at all as described. It doesn‚Äôt smell bad, it just was not what I had wanted to purchase (jasmine/sandalwood). It smells like fresh, clean soap or laundry detergent. The packaging is lovely, though. It is very aesthetically pleasing."
4,21-May-20,5,"Awesome scent I auditioned a few sandalwood candles for my home, and this one is going to earn top billing around here. It smells great: a classic, manly scent without being boorish or uncouth. Good burn time, and melted edge-to-edge pretty quickly on the first burn. Highly recommend."
4,21-Apr-20,4,Terrific candle I've been an avid candle person for decades. This Lulu candle is terrific. The scent is clean and fresh. Sometimes candles tend to smell clean in a cleaning supply/bathroom sort of way. This scent is the opposite of that--its smells like fresh laundry that's been outside blowing in the wind. I highly recommend it.
4,26-Jul-19,5,The Perfect Candle Last a longtime and is strong enough to fill apartment with a amazing scent
4,23-Apr-20,2,Mediocre at best Mediocre candle...not worth the price.....it burns super low and u have to put ur fave right up to it to smell it. I will never buy again.
4,31-Mar-20,5,"I got the Pineapple Evergreen scent and it smells Amazing!! I decided to purchase this candle based on all of the great reviews and it didn't disappoint.  The pineapple evergreen is the best scent, IMO.  Will definitely purchase again for myself and for gifts."
4,28-Sep-20,5,"Smells great and burns long This candle is small but boy oh boy does it mask the putrid smells in my room! I was skeptical at first but when I took the flame to this little guy, he did not shy away to leaving my room smelling like a bustle of tobacco in a pool of simmering vanilla. 10/10 would use this to give meaning to my nose again!"
4,6-Nov-20,4,"Linen scented candle Beautiful gift, lovely scent. Can't wait to light it and will order more from Lulu."
4,22-Feb-20,5,Smells great Wonderful scent. Very clean and also lasted a long time for being such a small candle. Will buy again.
4,7-Aug-20,3,Good scent The candle is very strong and smells fresh.
4,20-Aug-20,5,"perfect gift! i've bought this candle a couple times now and it smells incredible! the people i've gifted it to loved it and immediately lit it, and their apartment smelled amazing in no time!"
4,29-Jul-19,5,"My girlfriend loves it!!! I got this for my girlfriend as one of her birthday gifts, and she can‚Äôt stop raving about how much she loves it! Now I have I have to get her another one because she uses everyday ;) she says ‚Äúit burns evenly, and she loves the scent. It is soothing, grounding, natural, therapeutic and uplifting‚Äù it keeps her happy which is good for me :)"
4,29-Jul-19,5,"Sweet Lemongrass! Loving this sweet lemongrass scent, it is lovely without being too flowery and too strong. The scent is just right, takes a little time to build after the candle is going and is then perfect for a large bedroom or living room."
4,30-Oct-20,5,Pleasant The rose candle is quite nice!
4,18-Dec-19,3,best soy candle I‚Äôve tried yet I really like this candle brand. NATURAL products are always better than any alternative. The burn time is amazing. The scent of the blueberry cobbler is very strong and relatable to the real thing.
4,10-Feb-20,2,Quality Pricey but very good quality.Update: the company offered an extra tin candle as a reward for writing a review. It smells funny. I asked them what the scent was but i obtained no reply. I believe it‚Äôs a candle that no one buys so they‚Äôre trying to get rid of it.
4,25-Nov-19,5,Coffee house Scent really does overpower all of the other candles and I can smell it throughout several rooms of the house. Everyone compliments how good my house always smells.
4,9-Jun-20,5,"A candle with a great, unique scent and also burns slowly? Yes please! As a guy, I was looking for a candle with a more ‚Äúmanly‚Äù type scent and this one does not disappoint...I love the combination of jasmine, oud, and sandlewood and I also love how slowly it burns! A+"
4,28-Feb-20,5,Buy Great smelling candle that last awhile.
4,18-Sep-20,5,"Smells Great Smells like it says on the label. The scent is stronger/sharper than Glade candles, but doesn't smell ""chemically"" like Glade does. After an hour of burn time I'd say less than 1/20 of the wax was gone."
4,12-Dec-19,4,"Very good scent Love this candle! Gifted it to a friend who loved it. She burned it nonstop for about two weeks, so I'm not sure if that's a good long life or not. Still, wonderful scent."
4,15-Sep-20,5,My own little coffee shop! I LOVE the scent of this candle!!! It makes me feel like I'm sitting in a coffee shop while I'm right here at home... Loving it!
4,15-May-20,5,"Great candle Great, smells excellent and last long. Def buying More."
4,9-Jun-20,5,Great scent! I bought this because I saw it as one of the most recommended candles in a random article I found online - and it didn't disappoint! I usually go for floral or vanilla scents. But the fresh linen one might be my new favorite. Fills up my studio really well. The candle also has a clean minimalist look to it too!
4,12-Jul-19,5,Long lasting scent I love this brand and fragrance so I had to get a bigger jar! Sexy man smells like men cologne ?üòç?üòç
4,19-Jul-20,5,Long lasting I really enjoy the candle. It‚Äôs definitely meant for a small room because it gives off a light amount of fragrance. It‚Äôs not too overwhelming. It melts really slow which is a blessing and a curse. Sometimes the top doesn‚Äôt melt all the way through so it creates a buildup. I wish the wick was longer. Overall I love it!
4,29-Aug-19,5,Friend loves it I bought this for a friend based off of knowing she liked the smell of clean laundry. To say she loved the scent of this when she opened it for her birthday is an understatement!
4,26-Jul-20,5,Nice Candle Candle smells great. I love its minimalistic design. Good purchase.
4,15-Jun-19,5,"My new favorite candle! I purchased #13 - I can‚Äôt explain this scent it‚Äôs warm, slightly floral and sweet. I love it! It‚Äôs not over powering, but it fills the entire room. And it seems to burn slowly. Buy it! You won‚Äôt regret it!"
4,3-Oct-20,5,"Love the smell Slow burning candle.....great!! I was hesitant to purchase a luxury candle,glad I did.However,the candle is less money on the website.....at $14.95!!"
4,26-Feb-20,4,Lovely fragrance. Fragrance is lovely. The candle burned too quickly.
4,18-Nov-19,5,"Cute candle! Super cute candle! I got the pineapple evergreen which smells lovely. I don't usually like ""sweeter"" smelling candles but the evergreen helps balance it out. The candle is also a bit smaller than expected but it's super cute looking and seems to last awhile."
4,17-Dec-19,5,Love it! Love the smell! It‚Äôs gonna be a great gift! Also got a coupon for a free candle!! Good deal!Update; I received the free candle about a week later! It‚Äôs small but smells great.
4,2-Apr-20,5,"Normally not a fruity/floral/herby scent lover - this is an exception I read reviews about Pineapple Evergreen being so fantastic, I had to give it a try. Normally I opt for musky/smoky/vanilla/amber scents so this is super outside of comfort zone but it is so refreshing. Usually fruit scents are overwhelmingly fruity but the evergreen in this really mellows it out."
4,14-Apr-20,5,Amazing Smells fresh and delicious!
4,9-Jan-19,5,"Simple, clean, fresh I love the look of this and it smells awesome. I have wasted money on fancy and pricey candles that weren‚Äôt half as powerful as this!"
4,10-Sep-19,1,Save your money Not much candle for the moneyAnd the more meaningful issue - NOT much scent
4,9-Oct-20,5,Great Scent! These are the best candles on the market and price is right!  I like that you light it and you can actually smell it throughout the house some candles claim they are scented and have no scent. Great Value and they are long burning my favorite is jasmine oud and sandlewood
4,12-Jul-20,5,"LOVE this candle The scent is really strong, so if you don't like lemon, don't buy it. I, however, LOVE the clean scent, and absolutely love this candle. I'm going to buy a second one when mine runs out!!"
4,22-Jan-20,5,"Genius I am definitely a bit of a candle snob, in addition don‚Äôt really love fruity overly sweet scents. This candle delivers beautiful clean notes, long lasting, the pineapple mixed with evergreen is genius."
4,30-Aug-20,5,"Small Candle with Big Scent I ordered two of the candles in the ""Sexy Man"" scent and I love them! If you're like me and love candles that have a somewhat masculine, cologne-y type of smell, then this scent will be perfect for you. I can't wait to buy other scents and give them a try."
4,19-Jan-20,5,Outstanding aroma I truly love the scent of this candle! It was a little smaller than expected but i should have read the size description better. Still smells amazing!
4,20-Apr-20,4,"Clean scent, ergonomic packaging, on time delivery I used this product after cooking/eating in the kitchen. The smell is strong without being overpowering, and it spreads to the whole house (I got wild lemongrass). It has a fresh, clean scent, not cloyingly sweet. It lasts pretty long too, and got here on time. Would get again!"
4,14-May-20,1,No Smell Doesn‚Äôt smell like anything when burning. I had totaly forgotten it was on until I saw it 5 feet away and noticed it doesnt release smell. $15 wasted :(
4,29-Oct-20,5,"Smells Wonderful I love candles and with it being fall, going into winter, the apple cinnamon scent is amazing! I bought it as a gift for my son who loves candles and because it says part of the proceeds go to those helping abandoned animals. The scent is amazing and my son loved it too!"
4,15-Apr-20,5,Nice scent I enjoyed the fresh linen as much as the lemongrass scent
4,13-Jul-20,3,It's okay... The scent is very subtle barely noticeable.  I don't believe it's worth the money.
4,15-Feb-19,3,"Nice scent, small It was nice. Burned faster than the reviews I read. Small for the money. The scent was really nice and not over powering. I bought the Fresh Linen"
4,19-Mar-20,5,"Fresh Linen Smells Amazing! We recently got a dog and I wanted a candle that smelled fresh and clean to combat that doggie smell. Lulu Fresh Linen is the perfect smell...fresh and clean but not at all overpowering. The packaging/design is clean and simple, but nice enough that I would enjoy giving or receiving one as a gift. Will definitely purchase again!"
4,21-Oct-20,3,"Smells nice, but too strong to burn for longer than 10-15 minutes This candle smells great and looks nice, but it's a bit too intense. I can't leave it burning for very long before it becomes too much to bear. Fortunately, this means it will probably last forever."
4,17-Sep-20,5,Warm Blueberry Pie Love this smells!! Doesnt smell overly sugarly or fragrant like those cheap candel and literally smells like a warm blueberry pie! I can even smell it without lighting it up
4,24-Apr-20,5,"A man's room missing piece This smell (Amber, Rose & Sheer Musk) is great for a man's room. It is delicate and not invasive. Has deep semi-sweet notes.A comfy scent to come home to."
4,14-Jul-20,5,Like it. Lovely Strong scent. Long lasting.
4,26-May-20,5,Excellent buy Bought this candle as I liked the ‚Äòdesign‚Äô as it suits my downstairs bathroom.  I now love it as the scent is great and it‚Äôs long lasting.Great buy
4,29-May-20,5,Love the smell! I love the pineapple and evergreen combo!  Never thought of combining the 2 but it works! We leave it open in our guest bathroom and it leaves a nice consistent smell throughout the day.  Not too strong...just right (and I'm sensitive to smells).  Wouldn't change anything about the candle and will purchase more in the future.
4,22-Oct-20,5,"Incredible, zero regret This is hands down amazing! Just leaving the lid off the next day from burning, it still released this absolutely delightful scent."
4,2-Aug-19,5,"Coffee Heaven I bought the espresso bean candle (No. 18), and it smells great. It smells like fresh espresso. There isn't a chemical-y or stale scent like some other coffee-scented candles.The product looks great, and I can definitely see giving it as a gift to the coffee-lover in your life."
4,29-Jul-20,5,Long lasting and great scent So far I‚Äôm absolutely loving this candle. The smell is amazing it‚Äôs strong enough that it fills the room but isn‚Äôt overwhelming. It also burns slowly so I see this candle lasting as long as they claim. I used to only buy White Barn candles but this beats out those candles by far.
4,12-Nov-19,5,The BEST candle you‚Äôll ever buy These candles are the best I have ever used!! They are the best smelling candles I‚Äôve ever purchased and last surprisingly long for how small they are. I have so far used the apple cinnamon and the blueberry cobbler and I can‚Äôt wait to try out more! These are my favorite and I will never use another candle ever again
4,26-Apr-20,5,EXCELLENT QUALITY & DESIGN I LOVE THIS CANDLE AND HAVE REPURCHASED MANY TIMES. PERFECT TO GIFT! LONG BURNING TIME- LASTS LONGER THAN MOST OF MY OTHER CANDLES. IM IMPRESSED! CRUMB CAKE AROMA IS PERFECTION!
4,1-Jul-19,5,"Good candle Good candle, good smell and I like the label and design. It‚Äôs a tad smaller than I was expecting but looks good on my bathroom shelf."
4,21-Jul-20,5,"Worth It! Lasted ages, smelled amazing, easily filled multiple rooms"
4,8-Apr-20,5,Awesome! Smells amazing and burns cleanly! It‚Äôs very beautiful as well.
4,28-Mar-20,4,Perfect The scent is beautiful and the candle is very pretty. Without a doubt I will order again!
4,20-Jan-20,5,Smells amazing! This candle smells amazing. I have it let it yet since I'm in the middle of burning another candle. The candle has a very clean simplistic look. The candle looks great and smells great and the reviews said that it burns for a very long time. I got the buttercream vanilla cupcake and it smells exactly how it sounds.
4,7-Sep-20,5,"Love Tobacco Vanilla! I have been looking for a new brand of candles and came across this, particularly the tobacco vanilla scent. I lit it ASAP after receiving because the smell start out of the jar is AMAZING. It is a little small for the price but if you're looking to treat yourself I highly suggest it!"
4,2-Sep-20,5,My whole room smells good!! I‚Äôm always trying new candles that will not only smell good in the jar but actually make the room smell good. This one does! Pretty understated glass jar and label too. Will definitely try other scents as well.
4,13-Mar-20,5,Love the scent I purchased the jasmine/sandlewood candle. Love the fresh and not overpowering scent. Perfect!  Would definite purchase again.  Highly recommend if you like that fresh scent.
4,21-Jan-20,1,SCENT IS TOO LIGHT - Don‚Äôt bother w this one The scent isn‚Äôt strong enough. Don‚Äôt bother with this one. I read great reviews on it but was disappointed.
4,25-Nov-19,5,"Not overwhelming- just right! They smell great and the price is right! I like the amber rose or sugared pecan. But I also just received the holiday pine and it's really lovely. Not fake smelling, warm and soft. I said they're gift-able, but I have a hard time giving them away! Lol!"
4,18-Mar-20,5,"Absolutely love this candle! Was in need of a sweet smelling candle for my room.  I'm a loyal customer of a candle shop back home, so when I moved it made things a little more difficult.  So glad that I found Lulu's Candles on amazon!  It smells delicious, but not overly sweet or overly powerful.  Will absolutely be buying many more of these!"
4,28-Sep-20,5,"LOVEDDDD!! Loved this candle, scared because I'm halfway through it and I'm not sure what I'm going to do when it runs out! Half the house ends up smelling like coffee!"
4,26-Dec-19,4,"Yummy scent The candle had a soft scent, Very relaxing and enjoyed very much."
4,17-Apr-20,5,Powerful Punch of Scent! This small candle packs a lot of scent. It has a sleek modern look to it as well. Would definitely recommend as a gift or for personal enjoyment!
4,12-Apr-20,5,"Great soy candle!!! These candles are just great!  They are the perfect size, smell wonderful and are soy with a cotton wick! I gave one to each of my daughters as gifts and they loved them!  We are hooked on Lulu candles!"
4,9-Dec-19,5,Light scent This is a very nice candle the scent is not too strong . More like subtle yet it does have a scent
4,29-Mar-20,5,"Omg! Best ever! This is my first review. That‚Äôs how much I love this candle. This is by far the best candle for scenting the entire room & Smells amazing! Far superior to the much more expensive N*st candles. It smells wonderful just sitting on my nightstand not even lit! It smells cozy, luscious & decadent. Love, love, love!"
4,28-Apr-20,4,"Espresso Bean Candle Review The Espresso Bean candle smelled so, so good. I also love the classy, simple design of the candle and packaging."
4,27-Jan-20,5,"New Favorite Scent! I didn‚Äôt know what to expect when ordering because who would‚Äôve known pineapple and evergreen would make such an amazing combo! This candle is my new favorite scent. On top of that, it‚Äôs a soy candle that you can actually smell and that really lasts!"
4,30-Aug-20,5,"Great balance in the combination This was a great find.  The mixture makes the scent one that works well for people with different preferences.  It's not too overpowering.  Also, this is a solid addition for anyone working for home--good for reflection and notetaking between meetings."
4,30-Apr-20,5,Smell makes me happy to be home I wanted a candle that would make my house smell sweet yet inviting and at the same time not overpowering and this candle checked it all off. I‚Äôve been home for the past 8 weeks and I wanted to feel happy at home and was not disappointed when I purchased and received the lemon & vanilla bean candle.
4,14-Jul-20,4,Light and pleasant scented candle Nice little smelling candle . Scent is on the lighter side and almost anyone should like the scent . Price point a tad bit high for the size but burning hours does make up for that .
4,9-May-20,5,"Luxurous scent, I bought another one. I bought a 'Jasmine, Oud & Sandal Wood'  scent, like it so much that I bought it again to replace a candle I purchased earlier from a local shop."
4,31-Mar-20,5,Smells Delicious I bought the Happy Birthday candle that smells like buttercream frosting for my daughter's birthday. It came in a sturdy reusable box. The candle has the room smelling like a fresh baked birthday cake. I will definitely buy more of these candles.
4,2-Apr-20,5,so impressed! I ordered this because it was recommended to me from a YouTube video and at first I was surprised at the size of the candle as it was slightly smaller then expected. I was also nervous because the scents didn't have any descriptions. I got bamboo rose and absolutley love it! I will for sure be ordering more.
4,1-Nov-20,5,Soy candle with natural scent my daughter ordered one of these candles and i liked the scent so much i ordered one as well. I love the clean scent it puts out. It has a great smell but its not strong. You dont feel like your inhaling chemicals. Its just a wonderful scent that you know is burning clean fragrance.
4,28-May-20,5,"Nice natural scent, strong but not overpowering, long-lasting, cute Very cute candle, and very high quality. It has a beautiful natural lemon and vanilla scent and definitely lights up a room without being too overpowering.  Had it lit for a few hours and barely any had been used. High quality wax."
4,29-May-20,5,"Fresh linen is the way to go! I buy an egregious amount of candles and with many of my go-to spots being shutdown to customers due to COVID-19, it's been hard picking out a candle without smelling it prior to purchasing. I was hesitant at first, but after reading the reviews decided to go with the fresh linen scent. I definitely will purchase it again!"
4,22-Jun-20,4,"It‚Äôs fyeee I like it however it was a bit smaller than expected. The scent is pleasant and not to harsh on the nostrils or respiratory system. It‚Äôs clean and I can see it appealing to women you may over over fellas, or fellas, fellas. I don‚Äôt judge. It‚Äôs honestly a 9.25 out of 10 for what it is because it is a really nice scent"
4,15-Sep-20,5,"Wonderful Candles! Love Lulucandles! I am working from home and this is an awesome pick me up to get me through stressful days. Long burning and perfectly scented. Love Lemon and vanilla bean, very clean!"
4,20-Apr-20,5,Pineapple evergreen smells lovely I wanted to try out a new candle company and I am very pleased with this one. Pineapple evergreen sounds strange but I bought it because it got good reviews.... and it‚Äôs lovely! Made my kitchen smell so good. I‚Äôm not usually into tropical scents but I love the pineapple paired with the evergreen.
4,21-Apr-20,5,"Good buy It‚Äôs beautiful, very strong fragrance. I was a little disappointed that it was so small, but the quality it hush hand it burns much slower than other candles I‚Äôve bought"
4,28-Dec-19,5,Great scent!!! I love this scent! You definitely get what you pay for with this candle! The scent covers half my house when it is lit!
4,16-Nov-20,5,"Love this scent! I could smell the coffee scent through the box, and when I opened it was met with a lovely, not overpowering vanilla-espresso wave. I usually go for fruit scented candles, but since I am giving this as a gift with some specialty coffee, I figured this was the way to go. Glad I did!"
4,23-Nov-19,5,"Great Scent The scent isn‚Äôt too overpowering which is amazing. It‚Äôs also sweeter than I expected, which threw me off at first, but now I really like it, perfect for the holiday season. My room has a beautiful coffee shop scent to it now and I couldn‚Äôt be more happy. The packaging is also beautiful and goes nicely in my room"
4,28-Jan-20,5,"Can't get enough of this scent, and just purchased my second candle! This candle has a very interesting scent profile, and it smells completely natural.  I have a family member who prefers that all products be unscented, however this candle has even changed his mind!"
4,5-Apr-20,5,"Like a fresh cup of coffee brewing! I love the smell of coffee and wanted my office to have that lingering smell well into the morning.  Not only does it smell while burning, but seems to linger for hours and hours after I've extinguished the flame.  Not overpowering - just enough to put a smile on your face!"
4,30-Oct-20,5,"Quality candle! Received this candle today and immediately I noticed how strong of a scent this candle has even when it‚Äôs not lit! I have a relatively small room, and you can notice the scent right away when you walk in. Very pleased with the aesthetic, scent, and price of this candle. Will be trying others soon!"
4,8-Nov-20,5,Buttercream birthday candle for the win <3 This was a birthday gift for my mother in law who makes our kids a butter cake every time they come over. She loved this gift! It was super sentimental to her and it smells amazing!
4,24-Feb-20,3,Scent is nice but burns away... I bought this candle and like the scent (Fresh Linen) but the scent doesn‚Äôt actually burn that way.  To me it‚Äôs like burning an unscented candle.
4,9-May-20,5,"Fragrant candle that is a wonderful addition to any room! I got this candle for my daughter and she thought the packaging along with the ""I love you"" displayed on the candle was adorable. She was thrilled to receive this candle as a gift and thinks that the scent is divine! This candle was the perfect gift!"
4,1-Jun-20,5,"I love these candles! At first I thought these wont last long due to the size of the product, but I was pleasantly surprised when, while burning daily for approximately 4 hours each time, the candles lasted over 2 weeks.  I love the scent of the Lemongrass and it truly fills my apt with wonderfulness!  I'm glad I found these."
4,5-Feb-20,5,Love it!!! The smell is not overwhelming it smells amazing i loved it. I gave it as a gift and the person loved it.
4,1-Aug-20,5,"Lush yet affordable! Lovely scent, slow burning. Very impressed with this brand."
4,10-Aug-20,5,Smells amazing smaller than I thought but smells good Thank you so much for the candle smells amazing & is perfect for my GF!
4,10-May-20,5,"Yet Another Lulu Candle I Love I have ordered two Lulu candles now (Sexy Man and Jasmine, Oud, & Sandal Wood) and both have been amazing!  The scent is wonderful, the throw is great and the longevity is impressive.  I am already eyeballing 3-4 other scents to try out in the very near future.  Thank you Lulu Candles!"
4,30-Oct-20,5,New favorite candle I didn‚Äôt know what to expect as I‚Äôve never purchased this candle before and I didn‚Äôt know how Jasmine and Bergamot would mix. It smells amazing (and I like the simple casing)! I already purchased the linen scent and will see how that goes. I definitely recommend!!!
4,26-Aug-20,5,Got what I asked for This is a perfect blend of fragrances nothing is over powered or undermining. Long lasting scent even after the candle is put off. Overall its asubtle blend.
4,29-Apr-20,5,"Great candles! All the Lulu candles I‚Äôve bought have been huge hits. Such incredible scents, long lasting, and a great value! I burn these candles nearly every day and they also make great gifts."
4,6-Mar-19,4,Smell is strong with this one We haven' lit this candle yet bu the Espresso Bean scent is very strong already.  It is still in the box and it is all I smell when I open the cupboard.
4,18-Apr-20,5,Love the scent! Smells delicious! Looks quite nice too
4,31-May-20,2,Won‚Äôt buy again Not a strong scent. I‚Äôm not a fan.
4,31-Mar-20,5,"Best smelling candle ever! My friend gifted this to me, and we LOVED the scent so much, we left it on for several days, finally burning it out. We immediately ordered a new one. A bit pricey for the small size, but if there was an even bigger one we could buy, we WOULD!"
4,12-Aug-19,5,"A great gift! I gave this as a gift, and my friend told me that she liked it very very much"
4,10-Apr-20,5,Midnight In Paris I ordered midnight in paris and the scent is great! It smells like I‚Äôm sitting in a a candle lit bar in Paris having champagne with friends. Will buy again!
4,26-Nov-19,5,"Great scent for the size. Birthday gift. I was pleasantly surprised with this unique candle for my birthday. I figured since it was small, there wasn't going to be a big scent. It smells just like I was baking a birthday cake. The smell is so delicious and I am very pleased with it. Looking forward to getting another candle once this one runs out."
4,1-Jan-20,5,Perfect gift Love this candle for gifting.  Neutral smell that still is very pleasing. Looks great!
4,21-May-20,5,"Best cologne smell candle on market Easily the best smelling cologne candle on the market. I am absolutely thrilled. Not sure about longevity yet, but the candle still gives off a subtle scent even when not lit. Super impressed and will buy again. Now I just want to buy the cologne that they are mimicking ?ü§î"
4,21-Mar-20,4,"candel ok smell, price was fair"
4,23-Jul-19,5,"Best Sweet-Clean Smell for Any Setting This candle smells amazing! I barely even burned it for half an hour and my entire apartment was filled with this Pineapple-Evergreen scent. It's really a sweet summer like smell, and great for just lighting up before friends or guests come over to visit, as it gives off super positive vibes. I would definitely get one of these for myself, or even gift it. Definitely worth it!"
4,8-Aug-20,5,strong smell Great smelling candle that gives off a great scent.  Would make a great gift.  Not sure how long it will last since I have only had a few days.
4,22-Sep-20,5,Yummy Smell Just got this candle in the mail and OMG the smell is better than I thought. I got the lemon and vanilla bean scent.
4,11-May-20,5,"Wonderful scent and aesthetic minimalistic packaging The pineapple evergreen scent is very fresh with a slight sweetness that isn't overpowering at all. This is my first Lulu candle, and I really like the semi-opaque packaging packaging. Would recommend this scent (it's kind of reminiscent of car-freshener but with a sweetness to it) and excited to try more candles from Lulu!"
4,30-May-20,5,You won't be disappointed!  It smells great I just got my candle today and lit it up on this rainy afternoon. It smells absolutely beautiful.  You can actually smell it immediately from far away.  I love the soft yet musky smell... just beautiful!  I definitely recommend getting a few if you are a candle lover.
4,24-Feb-19,5,"Scent is accurate and clean burn I like the product , linen scent is accurate and it burns slowly as described. I enjoy it in my bathroom and it burns cleanly. I would buy it again."
4,2-Jan-20,5,"Supports Doggos! I actually really enjoyed the apple cinnamon smell, it's a little more sweet than I expected but nice. Maybe not theeee most aromatic candle, but good for a bedroom :) I will buy again with another flavor just to see what's out there."
4,20-Sep-19,5,"Wonderful Tobacco spice & vanilla This smells amazing! One candle scented my entire top floor with a lovely scent. I love love this candle and am so excited to try more LULU's candles. I have found the Holy Grail of candles. So many wonderful scents to choose from.Classy, simple, modern style. Goes with any decor style."
4,7-Sep-20,5,Great product - smells fantastic. Love this candle. Despite its small size the fragrance is strong enough to scent a large room without being overpowering.  Burn time is excellent.  Have bought this candle again!
4,24-Aug-20,5,"Great long lasting candle This is my second time ordering Lulu candle. Very happy with how long it lasts, scent, packaging and last but not least price. Perfect for a gift as well. I saw they have a gift set in a nice box."
4,30-May-20,5,SMELLS SO GOOD! I am picky about my candles and I love this one! I bought the Vanilla Oak No. 43. It burns long and illuminates beautifully. I also love the white glass jar that it comes in as it goes with my decor! Will definitely buy again.
4,30-May-20,5,Smell your Birthday Cake long after the cake is gone !! This yummy smelling Birthday Candle will help you remember your Birthday long after the cake is gone !! It is very aromatic and not over powering....this will be a gift I continue to give all my friends for their Birthdays !!!
4,20-Nov-20,5,?ü•¥ I LOOOOVVEEE THIS SCENT ! I love the candle ! It lasted maybe 30 hours at the MOST ! And then it starts to smell like something is Burning as it starts to die down ?üò•
4,14-Jul-19,5,"Very Excited to Burn this Candle! Smells wonderful, very clean scent, smaller size candle (6 oz) but looking forward to seeing how long I get to enjoy it. Would recommend to anyone looking for a quality candle brand that‚Äôs easy on the wallet."
4,17-May-19,5,"100% Quality A very beautiful smelling candle, makes me feel as if i was in a coffee caf?© in NYC listening to lofi beats. Would recommened to coffee lovers."
4,25-May-19,3,Smells a little off and not burning right Got the linen smelling one and not too happy with the smell.  More of a burnt linen after the wick gets to it.  Also don't like the wick that is in it.  It has created a crater into my candle leaving a decent amount of the wax on the sides.
4,23-Nov-20,1,Used candle I received this candle used and burned almost completely down with wax on the outside of the candle. I bought this candle new and as a gift. I requested a replacement item and if I get a used one again then I am going straight to requesting a refund. Ridiculous!
4,21-Mar-20,1,Small  and expensive Very small and extremely expensive.
4,29-Apr-20,5,Worth it!!! I bought this candle for my girlfriend and she loves it! I got her the cookie crumb scent for her morning coffee and the scent exceeded expectations. I saw that the reviews were high and I could see why. It‚Äôs clear that the quality of the product is worth the price.
4,11-Jul-19,5,This scent is wonderful! Usually this scent is very hard to smell in a big room. This  fresh linen was amazing! The scent lightly filled the whole room. I wish I could get it in a bigger jar!
4,4-Nov-20,5,"LOVE! these candles are the best! SO fragrant! i bought a smaller sized one at first.. loved it so much i just bought a bigger one!the wild lemongrass is my favorite. especially for the kitchen, very nice clean smell."
4,20-Sep-20,5,"Scent-a-licious I got this candle as a gift, but Iloved it so much I burned the entire thing in a week! Had to get two more for myself. This is the best scent I have ever found in a candle. 8 out of 5 stars"
4,12-Aug-20,5,Perfect Loved the scent of this candle ! I love the sustainability of soy based products and the cotton wick burns slowly letting me enjoy this candle much longer than most ! The packaging is classy and timeless and whether its lit or not I enjoy having this candle on display .
4,13-Apr-20,4,"Smells wonderful and lasts a long time! I ordered the ""Midnight in Paris"" scent and it is amazing! It does take a while for the scent to fill the room, but once it does, the aroma is pleasing without being overpowering. I love candles and this one has a nice slow burn. I would recommend this candle to anyone and it would make an excellent gift."
4,25-Aug-20,5,"Great Scent! The pineapple candle smells amazing. It is a bit smaller than I thought, but it lasts for a long time, and leaves a really nice scent in my room. Love it!"
4,16-Oct-20,5,"Great Fall Candle I purchased the sugared pecans candle, and it smells great. It is a perfect fall candle. The candle does seem to be long lasting. I thought it was be a little bigger, but size is accurate to description."
4,8-Apr-20,1,"possibly the worst candle i've had Does not burn consistently, burns itself out about every 45 minutes. Burns down thru the wax instead of across, and yes, I did try to keep lit for a few hours. No scent. Its just not a good product. I did buy a larger one on the same day which seems ok."
4,10-Apr-19,5,"Subtle and Sophisticated I listened to the other reviews and ordered the pineapple evergreen; they did not lead me astray! Great subtle scent. I also got the lemon vanilla bean and love it as well. It smells like a clean house. The only reason for only giving these candles 4 stars would be that the larger candle did not come with a lid, which means it'd be harder to gift if I wanted to. Overall, very satisfied!"
4,2-May-20,5,nice candles gifted this to a friend for a birthday.  great packaging and pleasant smells!
4,26-Dec-19,5,Good kitchen scent This is a great kitchen scent. For me it is good but not as amazing as the vanilla. The lemon is great for if your house really gets sticky after cooking and venting is not great. Again great packaging and label.
4,8-Oct-20,5,Great Candles I love these candles!! This is my favorite scent but I must say you can‚Äôt go wrong with any of the others.
4,21-Nov-20,5,awesome winter candle Lasted forever and had the perfect tropical christmas smell! Also not a ton of unnecessary smoke like some candles when you first light it.
4,2-Sep-20,5,"Powerful Tobacco, Spice & Vanilla scent This candle has a much stronger scent than most traditional candles I can buy in the store. The tobacco, spice, and vanilla scent is comparable to tobacco leaf candles I've purchased at Marshalls but with more spice."
4,31-Aug-20,5,"Smells amazing! I bought this candle recently, and the scent is fantastic - clean, not overly strong, and a great subtle smell. The candle also look elegant and fits perfectly with a clean house/apartment."
4,28-Aug-19,5,Smells so fresh Love it!!!! My house smells like clean fresh laundry! Best smell ever! Only downside is I just got it a few days ago and I‚Äôve almost burned it all out now bc I use it everyday
4,29-Dec-19,4,Happy with product The scent smells good as expected. Wish it had a stronger scent
4,25-Jun-20,5,Two thumbs up! This is the second Lulu Candles purchase I‚Äôve made and I LOOOVE it!  It was exactly what I was looking for and smells like the real thing.
4,3-Dec-19,5,"Wonderful Gift Best candle ever! Great throw. I can smell the 9oz throughout a 2,000 sqft house. A must buy and a great gift!"
4,12-May-20,4,"Love the scent! 6oz is pretty small, highly recommend 9oz Love the scent! I purchased the fresh linen. It‚Äôs not overwhelming yet it still fills the room. I would of gave it 5 stars but it was smaller than I had expected it to be. I highly recommend going with the 9oz. All in all, great candle. Will purchase the 9oz once this is done"
4,24-Mar-20,5,"Strong scent throw, nice packaging Often, small candles just don't have as much scent. This candle has a great scent throw, has burned nicely so far, and is clean, simple packaging. I will buy more!"
4,6-Jun-20,5,Smells great! Well made and smells amazing!
4,8-Jul-20,5,"SMELLS INCREDIBLE I got the Pineapple Evergreen scent and hoLY WOW..... it smells AMAZING! My new favorite scent, for sure!"
4,7-Jan-20,5,"I purchased two candles for a gift basket. I didn't get to enjoy these myself, as they were a gift, but both smelled SO wonderful.  I will most certainly purchase these again.  My friend said that she enjoyed them."
4,9-May-20,5,MOST amazing candle! This candle is the MOST amazing!!! I cannot believe the prize and how excellent it is! My favorite candle by far.
4,15-Sep-19,1,Disappointing!!! Barely smelled the fragrance and it was expensive. I would of been better off with glade for $4.99 than this $15 jar.
4,1-Jun-20,5,"One of my favorites! This candle is just so pleasant and refreshing - it's one of my Lulu favorites. I was online buying one for my mom but couldn't resist buying one for myself, too!"
4,23-Aug-20,4,Not My Scent This candle is very cute and looks great on a coffee table. I bought the tobacco spice & vanilla scent because I thought it would be nice to have while I am WFH. Not crazy about the tobacco part now that I have it going... but I like it enough to use it until it's gone. Will probably try another scent next time!
4,13-Apr-20,2,Weak flame and tunneling. Candle has a wonderful aroma and would deserve a 5 star review except it‚Äôs not burning well at all. Extremely weak flame that is unable to heat surrounding soy wax and after several burns the candle is ‚Äútunneling‚Äù.I‚Äôm going to return and try it one more time.
4,13-Sep-20,4,"Super fragrant! I was gifted one of these candles and I loved it so much that I bought myself 3 more scents. These are seriously the best candles! Although they are a little more than I would typically spend on a candle of its size, they burn so slowly and are super fragrant. I will definitely keep buying!"
4,25-Oct-20,3,"Very subtle scent The scent is nice, very subtle. Has a vanilla cake scent, however, it seems to be too subtle. The quality of the candle is legitimate, it doesn‚Äôt cause my eyes to itch or burn like generic paraffin candles do. Packaging is lovely. I‚Äôd try another scent, but this one doesn‚Äôt fill my bedroom."
4,7-Apr-20,5,"Great scent! LOVE this scent. It smells amazing and does not have a chemically/artificial smell that I hate about yankee candles and other brands. Smells very fresh and crisp. Can‚Äôt wait to have this going in my room!Not sure of the longevity, but I gave it 5 stars out of hope that it lasts forever."
4,22-Mar-20,3,Expensive!!! Too much money for a regular candle.
4,12-Oct-20,5,"Fantastic candle This candle smells amazing. I can faintly smell it across the room when unlit, and when I actually light it, it fills the whole space! I've had too many candles that have no scent when lit. This is my new favorite!"
4,6-Mar-20,5,"Earthy fresh scent I purchased the jasmine, oud, and sandalwood candle and although it was pretty pricey for the size, the smell is quite delightful! It‚Äôs the perfect addition to any room to bring earthy clean fresh smells into - our guests always comment on it when they come over."
4,7-Jul-20,5,Smells great and lasts a while The amber one smells great!
4,23-Nov-20,5,"Sexy Man Scent Ordered this candle for my wife because she loves cologne fragrances, smells very strong and very clean. Even for being a small candle the scent radiates but it is not overwhelming! She loves these candles, will definitely try out more scents."
4,28-May-20,5,"High quality candle Smells great, burns clean, warms up a room!"
4,22-May-20,4,Smells Great! This was the first candle I purchased online without smelling first and I am happy with my purchase. It smells so good and I will def purchase again. The only negative is that it‚Äôs a lot smaller than I intended and what‚Äôs pictured online.
4,22-Oct-20,5,Long Lasting Candle Lasts long. Great scent.  Keep the wick short and it will last a long time! I followed the directions to let it burn for at least four hours each time and I‚Äôve used it at least 20 times. There‚Äôs still life left in it. I love it.
4,19-Jan-20,5,"Niceee Really nice candle. Superb smell, lasts longer than you‚Äôd expect, a little pricy for a candle compared to what you‚Äôd get at the grocery store, but happy and have already repurchased 3 times"
4,13-Sep-20,5,Smells fab Smells fab! As always with soy candles the smell does not ‚Äòthrow‚Äô as far as paraffin candles. Label and lid are adorable and would be great as a gift. So far it burns evenly.
4,8-Apr-20,5,"Amazing!! Must buy!! I have had this candle for 4 days now and I absolutely love it! It burns slowly and smells amazing. I have a very hard time smelling a candle when it is burning unless the scent is very strong, and I can smell this candle from one room away. Perfect!"
4,10-Jun-20,5,Repeat Purchases It smells just like men's cologne and it's amazing! It has a very strong scent that last for hours in my tiny living room even after it's been blown out. The packaging it clean and pretty. Everything about this candle is awesome. I've literally purchased it twice now and have the third in my cart as I type this!
4,9-Apr-20,5,"great little candle The scent of this candle (I got fresh linen) is amazing. It's a little smaller than I expected it to be for the price, but hopefully it lasts a long time. The description says it's long-burning, so I am hopeful it will. The product itself is very well made and could definitely be used for a gift as well. I'm excited to use it!"
4,3-Mar-19,5,Buy it! The smell is divine! Just like clean laundry! Its not too harsh but enough to xover the room. Will buy again
4,16-Jul-20,4,"Very sweet scent I ordered the candles based on the description of the scent. As I burn them, I feel the scent is too sweet for my liking. I love the product, but will choose a different scent next time."
4,2-Jan-20,5,"Smelled great Candle was great, smelled terrific. My daughter in-law loved it"
4,10-Aug-20,5,Long lasting candles made in the USA. I love the fragrance of Fresh Linen.  Smells so clean.  The candles are soy which makes them last a long time.  Not your regular burning candle.  I used these before.  Another thing they are made in the USA.
4,7-Aug-20,5,"Small candle that packs a punch! For a small candle the scent this thing throws is amazing; fills up my entire downstairs with a wonderful aroma. These burn way longer than more expensive, brand name candles you typically see at big box stores that cost $10 more! Highly recommend!!!!"
4,25-Nov-19,5,"Great fragrance! I really don't know about longevity, since I've only been burning my candle for half an hour! BUT, It smells wonderful! I bought the black amber. The jar is a really nice size, with a really tasteful and attractive label. I love that it has a lid - it's nice to use when putting candles out. I would totally recommend!"
4,30-Sep-19,4,"Quality candle Got the 6oz size, it isn‚Äôt tiny but it is small. The scent is subtle with a nice blending of vanilla and lemon making it not too sweet smelling. The cotton wick and soy wax keep it from smoking. So far no headache from it either!"
4,30-Jan-20,5,Beautiful scent! Love this scent!! I buy a ton of candles and most I've ended up returning. This is clean and light and not too girly but super relaxing.
4,16-Dec-19,4,"Strong Scent I ordered the fresh linen candle to make my small apartment smell fresh and clean. It's a beautiful candle however the smell is a little overwhelming. You can smell it before you even open the box. Some may like that, I find it a little overpowering. It is a perfect little gift though I wish it wasn't as strong"
4,15-Dec-19,4,Lightens your room and heart I‚Äôm fairly picky on candles. I would buy this one again.
4,14-Jan-19,5,"Delicious! Yummy! Blueberry Cobbler scent makes me hungry :)  I searched high and low for the perfect, clean candle after the last one I burnt was leaving black residue in rooms of my house where the candles weren't even burning. This one seems much cleaner and my lungs thank me!"
4,20-Aug-20,5,Great alternative to Yankee candles After working from home for months on end I've grown desperate for any sort of change in ambiance.  These candles smell great and look classier than those Yankee candles with their brand plastered in huge lettering right on the front.  The candles shipped quickly and were nicely packaged.
4,6-May-20,5,"Love the scent I normally would not pick the scent Pineapple Evergreen (strange combination, right?) But after the reviews I decided to try it. Love it!!!"
4,26-Feb-20,5,Buy this Candle This is the best smelling scent of any candle I have tried.  I have purchased 3 and have been pleasantly surprised how these candles have an aroma that fills the room with a warm appealing scent.  I highly recommend these candles.
4,10-Jun-20,5,"Small but mighty, dog also approves I was surprised at the size (I didn‚Äôt read the dimensions), but this candle is potent! Clean linen is a great scent and burns really clean. That was the first candle I got. I also got the ‚Äúfurr a cause‚Äù lavender one. My dog already loves lavender (in general) but he really loves that candle too (pic included)"
4,8-Nov-20,5,"Wonderful scent! Love the smell! A great candle for the winter, and all year round. Will definitely be purchasing again"
4,14-Apr-20,5,Smells fantastic! Smells fantastic!
4,9-Feb-20,5,Definitely adding to my ‚Äúbuy again‚Äù list! This one smells Great! Very smooth and calming!
4,19-Jul-20,5,"Best candle so far First review on Amazon so far, but this is the best candle I‚Äôve used. I purchased the fresh linen scent and it‚Äôs just right, subtle and not too strong. It smells clean and not harsh at all. Will definitely be purchasing this again and I‚Äôd love to try the other scents."
4,19-Jan-20,5,Pineapple evergreen smells absolutely amazing! Beautiful candle with the most amazing scent ever! The Holiday edition is the perfect gift for any candle lover!
4,24-Jun-20,5,"Buy it now! Love love love! I wanted a soy candle that would fit summer season smells and last longer than other non soy candles I have tried. Not sure on the longevity but man, this candle smells amazing! Pineape with a tiny of Evergreen- perfect combo!"
4,29-Mar-19,4,not that strong it didnt last as long as i hoped and it didnt have a strong scent. it was kind of pricey for one candle.
4,22-May-20,5,"I LOVE this candle! I was looking for a fresh scent and this one is perfect!  Not too much, not too little.  I also love the simplicity of the candle and lable itself.  I will be buying more!"
4,4-May-20,5,Second time ordering This is my go to candle. This time I ordered two. You won‚Äôt be sorry!!!
4,28-Apr-20,2,"Hard Time Smelling Fragrance I bought this after reading all the great reviews, even googled best candles and found it there too.  I am extremely disappointed in the fragrance volume.  I cannot smell it unless I put my nose close to candle.  Going back to Bath and Body candles, haven't found any that beat them in volume of fragrance and hours they burn."
4,9-Jul-19,5,Perfect for Gifting I love the scent of this candle! It is very clean and fresh. The label design is sleek and simple. It can easily fit in to any home decor style.
4,28-Mar-20,5,"Smells great and burns well Since social distancing began, I've become reacquainted with the interior of my house along with all of its odors. This candle does an excellent job of transporting me from my smelly house to a coffee shop."
4,22-Oct-20,5,Love it! This is a strong stuff! I choose clean linens and it does smell like laundry recently made.. however it‚Äôs more for like for the bedroom. I def will try the other scents after this one
4,7-Jun-20,5,Smells amazing! The reviews about Pineapple Evergreen were so accurate! The smell is amazing. Went to order Lemongrass and because of the reviews I had to order Pineapple Evergreen too and I‚Äôm so happy I did!
4,28-Sep-20,4,"Very Fragrant This candle will fill your house with scent. Looks great, too.The Jasmine, Oud + Sandalwood tends to lean on the Jasmine side more which I'm not sure if I love, but that's the risk you take with buying a candle online."
4,27-Aug-20,5,"Strong smell - so good! my favorite candle! cute and pleasing to the eye & it smells so good, you can smell it from any room. I'll definitely be getting more of these, would highly recommend if you like strong smells! this one especially is so good"
4,11-Feb-20,1,"Like having a candle with no wick. The candle itself smelled great but the wick is terrible.  It‚Äôs very, very thin and burns much too fast.  I‚Äôm left with a lot of wax and a teeny tiny wick that hardly has any flame.  It‚Äôs really a waste of my hard earned money.  I‚Äôm glad I bought a small one.  I‚Äôll never buy this brand again."
4,22-Jun-20,5,Long Lasting I love this candle! The smell really fills up the room and it does indeed last longer than the average candle! I love burning candles but always worry about using them up too fast but this candle can burn for hours at a time and it hardly goes down at all!
4,10-Apr-19,3,"Not as aromatic as I expected. Liked the smell of the candle, scent wasn‚Äôt very strong. AT ALL. Bought it because the reviews were positive but that wasn‚Äôt my experience. I wanted a heavily scented candle to fill a medium sized room. This would work better for a small bathroom."
4,31-Mar-20,5,"Tasteful gift I bought a candle to accompany a painting I made for a friend. I wanted something simple and clean, and this fits the bill.  I always worry about buying scented things online, but the Lemon and Vanilla Bean smells great.  Overall, I'm very pleased."
4,23-Mar-20,2,"doesn't have any scent it is smaller than i thought, and it doesn't smell anything. Definitely not worth for the money.."
4,26-Apr-20,5,"Great smelling candle. Highly recommend I bought the pineapple evergreen scent and I'm so happy with my choice. it smells clean and fruity. also, it does not let out black smoke when burning which is great. Definitely will be trying other scents as well."
4,11-May-19,4,"Smells exactly as described I've dealt with a lot of products on amazon that simply smell like something else entirely. Not this. The scent is exactly as described.The only drawback is that it doesn't come with a lid. So, maybe not ideal for gifting. But, it smells great and I'm very happy with it. Definitely going to try out some of their other scents."
4,12-Nov-20,5,"Aromatically & aesthetically PERFECT! Can't believe I am tempted to say I ""love"" this candle.  But pretty darn close.  The scent is exactly what I was hoping for mellow and sensual.  Still not sure what Oud is, but looking forward to trying out all of the other scents as well!"
4,27-Mar-20,5,Smells amazing! The smell of coffee is one of my all-time faves. This candles smells like a delicious cappuccino. Very happy with it!
4,18-Aug-20,5,"Super scented I purchased the Wild Lemongrass soy candle for my home. When i opened the lid, I was impressed that the scent was very pleasing and strong.  I will be using this in my kitchen, especially when I am expecting company!  I am excited to try other scents from this company."
4,31-Jul-20,5,"All natural I was in the market for a natural scented candle, something that wasn't too strong like your run of the mill candles in brick and mortar stores. This was right up my alley. The scent isn't all too powering. Just right."
4,29-Jul-20,5,"Small but Mighty Pleasantly surprised by this little candle! I bought the small bamboo rose candle, expecting it to be like many of the other candles I‚Äôve purchased, they smell great but don‚Äôt throw much scent when burning. This candle throws excellent scent, that still manages to not overpower."
4,26-Feb-20,4,"Sexy Man Rules Sexy Man is pretty aptly named as a scent.  My description would be a mixture of warm sun on a man that exemplifies the subtle scents that one might consider ""new"" masculine.  Clean, slightly citrusy (don't let that worry you) vaguely leathery....like a high end cologne but subdued and not overpowering."
4,1-Jun-20,5,Lemon + Vanilla This candle smells GREAT. I was very nervous to buy a candle online that I've never smelled before in person. I am SO happy wth this purchase. hate candles that irritate my sinuses; They're very sensitive to certain scents. This scent is delicate yet present. Great purchase!
4,21-Apr-20,5,"Great Candles! My better half has been wanting some nice smelling soy candles to burn, so I bought this one (Jasmine, Oud, and Sandalwood) and another one (Sexy Man) after reading the reviews about them and couldn't be happier! They smell amazing and will definitely buy more in the future!"
4,17-Jul-20,5,"Wonderful scent, peaceful vibe I'm trying to make showering a somewhat therapeutic experience. Adding a shower speaker to play calming music and lighting this candles has helped a great deal. The scent is wonderful, and I love the vibe of a flickering candle flame."
4,29-Sep-20,5,YUMMY! I am NOT a candle lover but I read that soy candles are pet/environment friendly.  I could not resist buying the espresso scent - I used it for the first time today and I'm in love!  It's perfect for my home office!  Can't wait to try the other scents.
4,17-Nov-20,4,"Jasmine & Sandalwood Candle I purchased the Jasmine & Sandalwood scented candle and while it is a nice scent it is more Jasmine in it than Sandalwood. I read it was similar to the Le Labo Santal candle and I do beg to differ. It is a nice scent, very powdery. Good for a bathroom."
4,24-Apr-20,5,Beautiful scent Wow! I really love this little candle. I love the scent. This small candle worked for the entire first floor. It did a better job than those three wick bath and body work candles that I normally get!
4,4-May-20,4,"Birthday candle Perfect birthday gift, smells delicious and reminds the person that you were thinking of then on their birthday every time they light it."
4,1-Sep-20,5,Nice scent Nice scent
4,24-Jul-19,5,Great gift I brought this as a  gift. she loved it.  She said the smell was amazing
4,30-May-20,1,Strong and Musky Buyer beware. I love Jasmine and Sandlwood but this candle is extremely strong and musky. Not what I expected at all.
4,11-Oct-19,5,Pretty woman scent Smells really elegant...not too overbearing....really pretty scent. Burns really really long! I‚Äôve had this candle burning three nights and it‚Äôs barely made a dent!!
4,27-Mar-20,5,"THE BEST SMELLING CANDLE EVER No, but really."
4,7-Aug-20,5,Best candle!  Will definitely buy more. This is an awesome candle with a great long lasting scent.  I purchased the lemongrass and will definitely buy other scents as well.  The candle had a  nice clean burn and the lemon scent was beautiful.
4,7-Jul-20,5,"Best candle for a single gal Funny name, great smell"
4,7-Dec-19,5,Fresh linen clean scent Love the clean scent in our bathroom!! Will definitely purchase again!
4,27-Dec-18,5,"Long Lasting / Interesting and Pleasant Scent As the title indicates, our Pineapple Evergreen candle has been a nice addition to our home.  It's long lasting and smells good! The combination of earthy and tropical fruit sounds strange but really works well together.  We've been using this a little bit daily for over a week now and we are about 20% through the life of the candle.  We will buy more!"
4,27-Feb-20,5,Strong well balanced scent. Burns for a long time. Very strong smell and long burn time. It's small but with how strong it is you don't need it to burn long. Possibly my favorite candle.
4,8-Feb-20,4,They burn FAST!! the candle was nice but the burn rate was really fast.
4,21-Jun-20,5,"Perfect candle I really like the labeling and presentation of this candle. Very simple and attractive- perfect display in my living area. I got the Fresh Linen scent which is light and soft, definitely not over powering.  I will buy this again and maybe try another scent."
4,17-Dec-19,5,Love the scent! I love this little candle! It smells so nice and fills the entire apartment even though it's small in size. I can't wait to get some more. Not sure about longevity since I just lit it today.
4,14-Jun-20,5,Everything was great Candle smells really good
4,4-Jun-20,4,"WONDERFUL Love this scent, and candle!Would've given it 5 stars, if it was available in the 9oz, instead of having to go and reorder 6oz's more frequently.Wonderful scent, and nice even burn after 2 hours!"
4,29-Aug-19,4,"Nice smell pineapple evergreen Smells great and burns well, i wish it had a stronger smell."
4,19-May-20,5,"Just Buy It. Love my Midnight in Paris candle! I wasn‚Äôt sure what scent to expect, but when I lit it, the most beautiful scent filled my home. It‚Äôs a musty and warm scent of sandalwood and amber, with a hint of a floral Rose scent. The best smell without being overbearing. I want 20 more of these!"
4,10-Aug-20,5,Delicious Smelling Candle Purchased as a gift! Such a delicious smell worth the cost. I will purchase other scents in the very near future!
4,30-Mar-20,5,the candle smeal really good it was perfect
4,25-Jul-20,5,100% believer in soy candles now! I was skeptical at first because of this candle‚Äôs small size. And I also didn‚Äôt see many reviews for the scent I purchased (lemon & vanilla bean). Let me just say I should have never questioned it. It smells amazing and it‚Äôs not too overwhelming. It also lasts a long time. Just bought 2 more!
4,28-Feb-20,5,fresh sent very good. Powerful for a little guy :)
4,2-Oct-20,5,Great candly Smell amazing last long
4,20-Oct-19,5,Highly Recommend!! Great purchase. Originally bought the small size on a whim and ended up liking the candle so much I repurchased in the larger size. The scent is definitely there but it‚Äôs very refreshing and not overpowering. The candle lasts long and overall would recommend.
4,21-Aug-20,5,"Delicate scent for any room / occasion My friend introduced me to this candle, he had it both in his living room and bathroom. I loved the subtle scent when it‚Äôs not lit, and you definitely get more of it once you light it. Bought it immediately after, it‚Äôs a great price for its value. Highly recommend!"
4,3-Jan-20,5,Smells great I like that it has some great smell.
4,11-Mar-20,2,Not very good Doesn't smell outside of a 3-4 foot radius.  Pretty disappointed.
4,14-Jan-20,3,"Beautuful and wonderfully fragrant , sub-par burning length and characteristic Smells amazing ,burning time was on the lesser side of decent,wick refused to stay lit , but I lije the look of the votive and the packaging very much , and the scent was powerful and divine smelling"
4,15-May-19,5,My favorite candle I work from home and always have a candle burning. This is my favorite one! I have had multiple people ask me what it was and for a link so they could buy it. It smells so good that my friends blame me for their coffee run after they leave because the scent made them crave a cup of coffee!
4,4-Mar-20,5,"Not your typical Amazon gift! I purchased this for a teacher gift. I would love to buy locally, but I can't help the convenience of Amazon. This was PERFECT for the occasion. It is packaged cutely and is a great size for gift giving.  The scent smells amazing. YES!"
4,16-Sep-19,5,"Small but lightly I was skeptical when the candle arrived because it is so small, but the candle burns for a long time and the scent resonates.  The pineapple evergreen scent was light and refreshing. I'll definitely buy again."
4,27-Jan-20,5,Great scent and nice burn Very pleased with the scent and nice controlled burn.
4,27-May-20,5,"Very nice scent,  a change from the standard floral. The Tobacco Spice & Vanilla is a rich scent. I find it to be a nice addition to my office. I am not a smoker but find the scent to be pleasant."
4,29-Aug-20,5,"Smells so goooood! Um, hello lovely candle! Bought the Jasmine, Oud, & Sandalwood and it smells so good!!! Would make a great gift!"
4,13-May-20,5,Small but good I love the way it smells and the packaging is very clean and simple. It was a bit smaller than I expected. I put a picture of it next to some altoids incase that helps.
4,10-Jan-20,4,"Great Scent! I was really impressed with the candle.  I wasn't sure what OUD smelled like when mixed with Jasmine and Sandal Wood, and I have to say it's really nice!  It's a very nice scent, slightly masculine, but not overpowering at all.  Great Candle, I would purchase this again!"
4,16-May-20,5,"Best scent and great look These candles are the best smelling candles I have found. The scent is perfect (you can actually smell it throughout a large area, but not overpowering). The scent options are all very nice! Great look as well- looks like a much higher end candle. Great for gifts!"
4,10-Apr-20,5,"Love this candle! This candle is better than I expected! The vanilla oak scent is wonderful, even my not-so-candle-loving husband approves and asked where we can get another one! I will be purchasing this scent again!"
4,28-Jun-19,5,Great clean scent Amazing scent! Really love it! I bought it as a gift and I‚Äôll order more .
4,15-Oct-19,5,"Long lasting, great smell, clean Honestly look for candles my life that last this long. Great job! Supporting an awesome company!"
4,10-May-20,5,"elegant, strong scented, long lasting candle A friend of mine recommend I shop this brand and I have never been so impressed with a candle. The scents are strong, without coming across synthetic or overwhelming, and the candle burns for much longer than you would expect considering the size. 20/10, will be purchasing again!"
4,27-Feb-19,4,"Smells great, small size for price Love the scent of the candle!  Nice gift idea as well.  A little smaller than expected either price."
4,25-Dec-19,5,"Smells Great Love the scent. I did not read the product details thoroughly and the candle is smaller than anticipated, but that is my fault. The candle was very well received as a gift."
4,22-Jun-20,5,Best candle out there. Best candle I have ever purchased. No smoke or black soot.
4,4-Aug-20,5,Flea Repellant They seem to work as a great flea repellent. Thanks.
4,19-May-20,5,"New favorite candle! This is such a lovely product. I have the 6oz Espresso Bean candle, and I already think it‚Äôs going to outlive my Bath and Body works 3 wick 14.5oz candle. The smell is divine and can fill a room without being overbearing, which can be rare to find. I‚Äôll defjiely be repurchasing when it‚Äôs done!"
4,15-Jan-19,3,"Good candle, but would try a different scent I ordered the Fresh Linen candle. I think that I was expecting a subtle scent of clean laundry, but this definitely smells more powerful and reminds me of a Plug-In. It is not unpleasant, but definitely a bit stronger and more powdery than I was expecting. The candle burns cleanly, and the packaging is really nice.  Overall, I would recommend."
4,23-Dec-19,4,LULU Candle fresh linen Very nice fragrance when lid is opened. Have not burned it yet but I think I will like it. Nice jar and lid for a small candle. I like it. Love the way the lid has a gasket like plastic that seals the jar and makes it so the lid wont come off easily. nice touch. Oh Just lit it and it smells nice !!!
4,11-Apr-20,5,"This just smells so good!! First time buying a scented candle, the overall look is just exactly what I wanted, simple and cute!Not too big not too small good deal.And the smell turned out to be perfect, a kinda special very recognizable smell, but def not too much, sweet and warm but also refreshing."
4,18-Sep-20,5,I love it! I honestly love it. Surprisingly it didn‚Äôt smell like pineapple.. but I did like the smell. The Pineapple Evergreen smells more like a cinnamon smell but I enjoyed it. I just ordered more. I use mine on a candle warmer because they last long than lighting them up
4,22-Nov-19,5,"The best! Absolutely love these candles. My first purchase was the Evergreen and Pineapple- amazing! I just received the Sugared Pecans one, and it smells just like the holidays! These are now my go to candles for myself and gifts for others. Very affordable too for how long they last!"
4,11-Nov-20,5,"Fragrant, long lasting This is a small candle, but outstanding burn time and fragrance.  I ordered the Tobacco & Vanilla candle. The fragrance is long lasting and you can detect it even when the candle is not lit in a smaller room.  Highly recommend this."
4,23-Mar-20,5,"Great scent I bought the ""sexy man"" scented candle partially as a joke but it smells delicious! If you go through candles the way I do, I would recommend getting the largest size."
4,23-Nov-20,5,Perfect! This smells amazing and actually fills the room with scent. I have purchased so many candles on Amazon  that you only smell if you get up close to them.
4,15-Jun-20,4,"Smaller than expected, but smells INCREDIBLE!!! This candle came to me smaller than I expected but that's really because I neglected to read the sizes. Still - one of the best 'fresh linen' scented-anything I've had. Fills the room with good smells very quickly after lit, too.  Overall would highly recommend, just make sure you check the sizes!!"
4,24-Jul-20,5,Great scent The scent smells delicious
4,3-Nov-20,5,Amazing scent! My new favorite candle! I‚Äôm so glad I decided to purchase Lulu Candles. The product feels luxurious without breaking the bank. The wax is silky smooth and the scent is amazing. It fills up my entire room by just removing the lid. Beautiful candle!
4,15-Jun-20,4,Great scent but not a regular This is a good-smelling candle but it isn't perfect. The wick is cheap and falls apart while burning. It does not stand out enough to make it a regular order.
4,7-Jul-20,5,Very Relaxing The box smelled so good before I took the candle out. This is a very relaxing floral scent. The candle burns evenly. I will be buying other Lulu candles.
4,7-Mar-20,5,"Heavenly Smell Cute packaging- very nice chic black box. And the pineapple evergreen scent is heavenly. Not overbearing or too fruity. Evergreen really balances it out. Love it. The only complaint is it‚Äôs pretty expensive, but it‚Äôs obviously a high quality candle."
4,8-May-20,4,"Scent Nice, simple designed candle! It‚Äôs a little too potent for me since I prefer earthy candles, but might have been the scent and I‚Äôd be interested in trying another."
4,13-Sep-20,4,Recommend The candles are overall really nice. I bought them because I specifically wanted soy candles. The scents are strong out of the box but less intense over time. The blueberry cobbler just smells like yogurt to me so I wasn‚Äôt a huge fan but will repurchase to try our other scents.
4,21-Aug-20,5,"My new favorite candle I love this scent. I bought the fresh linen and it fills my whole room with the smell of laundry. It burns slow, so the flame is small. The packaging and the candle were definitely worth the money. I wish I had bought a larger one!"
4,25-May-20,5,Must buy Extremely impressed with this candle. Excited to try other scents.
4,1-May-20,4,Great scent Smells really nice! I wish it came in a larger size.
4,16-Apr-19,5,Best smelling candle I've had I wish they made a cologne out of this scent. It lasted a lot longer than other candles I have purchased on Amazon. I would definitely buy a lot of different ones and find the one that fits your personality. I am not floral and I am not into super strong scents - I like to be able to breathe and this set a nice tone.
4,21-Jun-20,5,super cute and smells amazing! I'm really glad I found this company. I was looking for an affordable candle company that still gives me a luxurious vibe. It is smaller than I thought it would be but I still love the aesthetic of the candle and the smell is also amazing.  I was able to burn my candles the whole day no problem.
4,26-Nov-19,5,"Amazing!! I absolutely love this candle! The scent is amazing and the candle lasts so long. My husband accidentally left the candle burning (eek) nearly all day while we were out of the house. When we got back, the house smelled amazingly and the candle was only half gone. I love it! Will buy more!"
4,10-Apr-20,4,Smells wonderful This candle is a bit more than what I would normally pay for a 6oz. candle but the reviews are what sold me. They are correct in saying it smells great. I have only had it for a short time so I cannot attest to the longevity of it yet but I would definately buy again.
4,22-Nov-20,4,"Great Scent I highly suggest purchasing the Pineapple-Evergreen candle. It smells great but these candles are a bit on the pricier side for being only 6 oz. I have seen reviews of the candle exploding, this hasn't happened to me, but be careful and don't leave the room while it's burning."
4,23-Jun-20,5,I love Lulu candles! These candles are lovely. The Vanilla Oak has a very natural scent and smells sooo nice! It's not strong or overwhelming at all. What is even better is that it's made from natural ingredients! Highly recommend and will definitely be ordering more.
4,12-Nov-19,5,Best candle scent I‚Äôve found! Pineapple Evergreen is absolutely wonderful!! I debated about the scent because it‚Äôs winter. I couldn‚Äôt be happier. It‚Äôs perfect for any time of year. Would purchase again in a heartbeat!
4,22-Jan-19,5,"Great long  lasting little candle! I will admit, I am a sucker for candles. I have to have one in my very small office to help combat those pesky ""office"" odors. I originally bought this candle for the price and the reviews, and I am NOT disappointed. Getting ready to get a few  more. I had it lit all day yesterday and it barely made a dent!!"
4,28-Aug-20,5,"Solid Fresh Candle Not a bad soy candle. Got fresh linen, was satisfied."
4,9-Apr-20,5,"Small but mighty. I almost never buy candles without smelling them first. But I‚Äôve been trying to keep my WFH quarantine serene with lovely candles. Based on a recommendation of this company from a friend, I took a chance on the sweet pea, jasmine and apple candle. It smells AMAZING. I will be ordering more."
4,18-Aug-20,5,Really well crafted I‚Äôm really enjoying my candles. The scent is great and refreshing without being overwhelming and the packaging is just so clean and modern. Definitely will be ordering again.
4,2-Jun-20,5,"Perfect Pre-Summer Candle I enjoy the wonderful and vibrant notes in this quality soy candle.  The high notes of the sweet jasmin with the perfect middle and low notes from the sturdy oud and sandalwood, the combination of these scented elements fill the room ever so fragrantly with a hint of sexy.  Love it!"
4,22-Nov-19,5,"Expresso Bean I'm a huge candle person and am really picky on what ones to burn. I was hesitant to order online but decided to give this brand in the coffee scent a try. The jar itself is nice to look at but the scent is wonderful! I will order more in the future and these would make perfect gifts for people,"
4,8-Jun-20,5,We have enjoyed all the candles we have purchased!! Candle burns slow- great scent- my guest always comment on how good it smells in my house!!
4,16-May-20,4,Great scent for your bedroom or office. Love this scent! Never smelled another candle like it. I had it downstairs at first but my husband and I both agreed the smell is for a smaller area and moved it up into our room. I do think the size of the candle should be larger for the price.
4,6-Aug-20,4,Concentrated Potent Fragrance This candle immediately blooms throughout the whole apartment (350 sq ft). It seems they spared no expense on the oils used. Just wish it came with a lid to snuff it out.
4,8-Jul-20,5,"BEST purchase in the last six months I love this candle!i bought this after seeing it as a dupe for the Le Labo Santal candle.  The scent is so beautiful, I can smell it even when not lit. It has burned very nicely and it looks great. I am almost done with my first and will be ordering another very soon."
4,23-Apr-20,5,Will buy it again Love it and it lasted longer than I expected!!!
4,18-May-20,5,"Great little candle! I received this candle about 2 days ago and have been burning it almost non-stop ever since.  The fresh linen scent is phenomenal!  The smell is so clean and fresh, I want to rub it on my clothes (but I won't).  I'll just settle for burning it all day.  I highly recommend it."
4,26-Jun-20,5,Smell clean Like clean smell .
4,31-May-19,5,"Extremely pleasant scent and good burn Currently burning this candle and the vanilla oak is a very, very pleasant and calming scent that isn't overwhelming.  The scent is subtle and clean smelling and doesn't clog up the air with an overly powerful aroma.If you're looking for one that won't take over your house, give this a shot."
4,9-Oct-20,4,"Great Soy Candle Option! Excellent scent, decent longevity, elegant design. My only complain is that it does not come with a lid. Otherwise, packaged well and a nice product."
4,16-May-20,5,"Great scent! The candle smells great, I was very impressed. I got two for myself and two as a gift. I just wish it burned a little bit longer or was a bit bigger."
4,4-Jun-20,5,Amazing smell! I bought the Pineapple Evergreen scent and it is exactly what I thought. I've only had a few weeks but I light it daily and still has lots of life. Very cute packaging and labeling.
4,15-Apr-20,2,"Too expensive for the size! Not very pleased with this candle purchase.  For $15 I would‚Äôve expected it to be at least medium sized.  This is a very small candle, and not worth the money."
4,7-Dec-19,5,Gift for son with anxiety. Son says this helps enormously.
4,20-Aug-19,5,Amazing candle I have had some bad luck with candles lately and am glad to have found this one. The smell is great and it travels far. I can usually smell it in at least two to three rooms where it is lit. Very happy!
4,17-Aug-20,5,"Second purchase and still incredible I tried out lemongrass and pineapple evergreen, and both exceeded my expectations! They are super reasonably priced, have a cool modern design, and most importantly, smells so good! These candles have really great throw, and will for sure fill up your room. Highly recommend!"
4,26-Jun-19,5,"Worth the cost Amazing candle!! When I saw how small it was I was a bit put off by how much I paid, but it is the SLOWEST burning candle I‚Äôve ever seen. It definitely lasts and the scent is just incredible. 10/10 would recommend ?ü§©"
4,14-Jun-20,5,Subtle pleasant scent. Light scent. Have now ordered two more. One for a gift for my 15 year old granddaughter who liked the scent and another for myself for another room. Thanks
4,16-Sep-19,5,My favorite! This candle makes me entire open concept two bedroom apartment smell amazing up until the very last minutes of use. You don't have to light it for long to fill your home with fragrance. I get so many compliments!
4,15-Dec-19,5,Would recommend Wonderful ascent and long burning
4,11-Aug-20,5,Yumm! This candle smells better than I expected!
4,24-Jun-20,5,Lovely Smells delish! Very unisex.. not too sweet not too musky!
4,18-Mar-19,5,Good product Smells good not to overwhelming. A little smaller then I thought but burns for a long time.
4,16-Aug-19,5,"Great smell, well perfumed! I immediately lit the candle when it came in today (ordered yesterday) because I love the smell of bergamot. The combination with Jasmine is great and the candle has a lot of perfume, which I think is great because you so often get scented candles that you can't really smell. Definitely recommend!"
4,14-Dec-19,5,Smells fantastic Fantastic and smells so good.
4,13-Dec-19,5,Great candle and great price Awesome candle for a great cause. Smells wonderful!
4,5-May-20,5,Quality candle! Lulus candles never disappoint!  Slow burning and not overbearing- will continue to buy from them!
4,18-May-20,5,Did not disappoint Heard about this scent and thought I would give it a try.  Did not disappoint...great fragrance at a very fair price for such quality..will definitely try other scents from Lulu Candles
4,19-Feb-20,1,"Wouldn‚Äôt recommend The candle burnt uneven, I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this. For the price I wasn‚Äôt satisfied with the quality or lifespan."
4,23-Sep-20,5,"Amazing product ! Buying again !! This candle spelt amazing as soon as I opened it. Then I was found even more happy once I lit it , it smelt just as great. I could smell the candle from throughout the house for a few hours and it made all floors smell amazing! Definitely buying this again!!"
4,12-May-20,5,Candles are worth it! Love this smell way better than the Fresh Linen ...ready to try some of your other scents.
4,9-Jun-20,5,"Love these candles! I just received the candles yesterday, and I will definitely be purchasing more!  I love the scent, and it is easy to smell in the house without being too overpowering.  I bought the lemongrass, pineapple evergreen, and jasmine lily.  I also love the simple design, it goes great with any decor."
4,3-Jul-20,5,"Delightful Candle Loved the scent, Pineapple Evergreen... who would have thought??, but it was refreshing while not being over-powering. I think that the candle will look lovely and smell delightful in your home as well as making for a beautiful hostess, birthday, etc. gift."
4,5-Apr-20,2,Great candle but inconsistent quality I‚Äôve purchased 6 or 7 of these (we love them!) but our most recent order was defective. The wick was short‚Äî the last section of the candle can‚Äôt burn because the wick ran out. Have tried to contact the company but haven‚Äôt been able to.
4,24-May-20,5,Lovely scent Arrived on time.
4,7-Jul-20,5,"Smells Great, Looks Good! I love my fresh linen scented candle! A light and fresh scent that perks up any room it's in. Perfect for a small coffee table or a book shelf, these candles really complete the decor of any space while adding a functional touch. Will absolutely buy again!"
4,3-Sep-20,4,Nice candle...just wish there was more of it. The scent is nice and light. For some reason I thought it was going to be a bit bigger - the company does give the size so I must have missed that detail. I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôd purchase another one but I definitely will use this candle in my home.
4,31-Aug-20,5,Love it! I love the scent and get many compliments when we have guests over. It‚Äôs surprising that the scent of such a small candle can fill up the whole house. Love it!
4,22-Apr-19,5,"Smells so good Love this candle I've only had it for a few days but so far so good, very nice scent!"
4,2-Sep-20,5,Fresh Scent-Even Through A Mask I recently smelled this candle at a spa I was at and smelled with wonderful candle even through my mask! Such a fresh and clean smell- just like it calls out.
4,7-Feb-20,5,I'm Obsessed This candle smells absolutely wonderful and it lasts forever! I bought one several months ago and burn it regularly and still have half left. The evergreen pineapple scent is very pleasant without being overpowering and makes my home smell amazing. I can't wait to try other scents!
4,20-Apr-20,5,Beautiful and long lasting! Beautiful candle that burns beautifully! I always have a candle in my house to cover up the smell of the litter box when my cat goes. This one does an amazing job and is really luxurious looking as well!
4,3-Aug-20,5,Awesome! I bought the pineapple evergreen scent and it smells amazing! I didn't know what to think of it but everyone said how good it smelt and they are not wrong! The candle burns slowly and relaxing!
4,14-Nov-20,5,"Customer service rules customer service is incredible! i received a defective wick and reached out to see what they would suggest to correct. they immediately responded and replaced! i chose the tabacco spice and vanilla, the candle fills my entire room but not in an overwhelming way. i love it!"
4,12-May-19,5,Do it!! SMELLS SO GOOD LOVE LOVE LOVE. everyone reading this feel free to send me some!!! Buy some you‚Äôll have zero regrets!!!
4,8-Nov-20,4,"Good scent. Small candle. Ordered this as a gift and it smells good, however was much smaller than I expected.  The description said 6oz but the photos made it appear larger. I was a little disappointed with just how small it actually is for the price."
4,13-Dec-19,5,"Awesome Scent Not knowing which candle scent I wanted, but I took a chance and ordered the Jasmine, Oud & Sandal Wood and it is a home run! Love the scent and it burns nice and slow just as advertised, giving the room a warm cozy homey feeling and made in the good old USA. Try it you'll love it!"
4,26-Jul-19,5,Smells like vanilla heaven Bought this for a friend who loves candles. She said she wanted to eat it. It smelled good enough to.
4,24-Feb-19,4,"Small and handheld I read other reviews that said it was small, but it really, truly is tiny. My fault for not actually reading the description. I bought the 6 oz, and although it is p much a handheld candle, just like all the other reviews, it smells amazinggg! For reference, a Bath and Body candle is 14.5 oz. I‚Äôm 50/50 on buying a second one just because of how small it is. Aside from that, no other complaints!"
4,29-Apr-20,5,Long lasting at reasonable price Great candle at a reasonable price. Fun scents that are strong but not overwhelming. LOVE ‚ÄúSEXY MAN‚Äù! Glass container that can be reused with a votive. Longer lasting than any similar priced candle. A must have!
4,22-Aug-20,1,"Doesn‚Äôt smell like cologne at all... I was looking for a new manly scent for my home. Went out on a limb and decided to order this candle, as it states it‚Äôs a manly cologne smell. Completely false! It smells like lemon soap, and has no scent of cologne at all. Complete waste of money."
4,23-Sep-19,5,Jasmine is amazing I love these candles. The Jasmine Bergomot is my favorite. I think these candles aren't crazy expensive so that's really nice. Keeps me coming back to buy more. I've also gifted them to many friends and family. I'm a loyal fan!
4,17-Feb-20,5,Well worth it! Lasted forever!
4,29-Oct-20,5,"Great Dupe! I bought the No.14 Jasmine, Oud, & Sandlewood as a dupe for the Le Labo Santal 33 and it's perfect! This scent is the perfect subtle relaxing smell I need all year long. I recommend it to everyone who's looking for a reasonably priced candle with an actual pleasant scent!"
4,29-Sep-20,5,"Best candle out there! These candles are my new favorite! I used to be a bath and body works girl but those candles die too quickly. Lulu candles last and last, even the small ones! The scents are oh so good and fresh un til the very last drop. Do yourself a favor and grab one...or two or five."
4,27-Aug-20,5,"Perfect smelling candle Absolutely obsessed with these candles. For being as small as I ordered it, I wasn‚Äôt expecting it to pack such a punch. This candle lights up my whole kitchen living room area by itself with the scent it puts out. In love. Will definitely be ordering more!"
4,14-Jun-20,5,"Smells awesome, looks good, great for mood I bought a Lulu Candle to enhance the mood in my bedroom, and my wife and I both love it. A week after I bought it, I decided I wanted another one for my desk! Great quality, great scents."
4,5-Feb-20,5,Cute and smells amazing! I love this candle. The design is cute and the scent is wonderful. Thenjar is smaller than I imagined but I‚Äôd buy another one.
4,27-Feb-20,5,"Just what I wanted. The brown sugar and OUD is fantastic. The perfume I wear is velvet rose and oud but it‚Äôs a bit strong, so I decided to try out this candle in hopes it‚Äôd be more delicate. No too overpowering, but you get hints of the smell in the room it‚Äôs in just with the lid off! Perfect!"
4,5-Aug-19,5,"Wild Lemongrass This is my first purchase of this candle. I wasn't sure what to expect with the scents so i picked the wild lemongrass. The smell is great!  I've never had a soy candle before so I've definitely noticed the difference in life. I cant remember a time I've had a candle last this long! Very happy with this purchase, would buy again."
4,21-Nov-20,5,"Gave as a gift and it was a hit! Got this candle for my mom for a happy birthday gift since we couldn't be in person.  She loved it!  It gave the special blow out the cake feel, and was well received and smelled great!  Would highly recommend."
4,5-Feb-20,5,"Tobacco, Spice & Vanilla Bought the Tobacco, Spice & Vanilla candle. The smell is amazing. From what I can tell, the candle is lasting a pretty long time for how big it is. On that note, it is a smaller than I was anticipating (ordered 6oz). Overall, it's a really nice looking and smelling candle that I would recommend."
4,9-Aug-20,4,"Solid candle 100% I have been shopping around for quality candles for a while, and this is a solid buy. The scent is is strong, the design of the candle packaging is very modern, simplistic and pleasing to look at. I would absolutely recommend this for personal use and as a gift. Great candle!! :)"
4,13-Oct-19,5,"I enjoy the scents of these candles I've purchased the Sugared Pecans and Espresso Bean scents.  Both are very good! The candles do last a very long time and burn completely.  The scents are also very nice. I only wish they were a bit stronger because, at least for the Sugared Pecan, the scent don't seem to drift far enough from the candle to fill a bigger room."
4,2-May-20,3,"Good scent but very smoky The scent of this candle is good. However, the problem is that it is very smoky. The black smoke is very visible. I tried many ways but it was still there, especially when you blow it off.. it turns to be 2 min smoke hanging in the air...."
4,3-Jul-19,5,Great gift Got it as a gift for a friend so I‚Äôm not sure how long it will last but it did smell good.
4,25-May-20,5,Yummy smell! Smell is bomb!
4,12-Dec-19,5,Smells like Xmas tree and a pineapple Smells better than I thought it would.
4,15-Nov-20,3,Melted Candle was all melted to one side of the jar. Some leaked out in to the box. I had to dig out the wick and mold it back together. It otherwise smells great.
4,2-Nov-20,5,"Great scent This is the best smelling apple cinnamon candle that I‚Äôve smelt. A nice fragrance, but not overwhelming. It also didn‚Äôt bother my allergies, which is a win."
4,20-Nov-20,5,Bamboo Rose is Heavenly I am a big fan of Lulu candles. I purchased a Bamboo Rose candle for myself and ithas a very peaceful and meditative aroma-therapeutic quality to it. Very happy withmy purchase and will purchase another again soon. Makes a great gift as well.
4,1-Jul-20,3,Candle Its just too small for the price but it‚Äôs whatever. It smells nice but it couldn‚Äôt really make the whole room smell better.
4,9-Dec-19,5,S‚Äôokay Wasn‚Äôt as strong a scent as I would like.
4,22-Nov-20,4,"Delicious smell These candles are in an elegant container and have a great smell.  I have gotten three different varieties for different parts of the home.  They accompany us in the living room, with baths, and during yoga practice and are attractive to look at and calming/therapeutic."
4,10-Mar-19,3,"Smaller than expected. It smells good.  Fragrance covers a good part of the space it's in. Not an overwhelming smell. However, considering what I paid I expected a larger candle."
4,30-Jun-20,5,Blueberry cobbler for the win! Literally the best smelling candle ever.  It burns super slow and the smell is strong.  I‚Äôve tried a few other flavors but this by far is the best.
4,4-Sep-20,4,Greatest smelling candle ever Not a very big candle for $14.00 smells fantastic and can't find anything else like it so $14 it is. Didn't give 5 stars for longevity because of the size of the candle
4,3-Sep-20,5,Awesome scent!! It smells amazing & has very simple packaging!! So excited to burn it later :)
4,6-Nov-20,5,SMELLS AAAAAAMMMMMAAAZZING!!! This candle did not disappoint!  It smells amazing without being too overpowering!  I will be buying this again.
4,26-Jun-20,5,Yes! I love these. Fairly priced and burn slow with a room filling scent that lasts!
4,15-Feb-20,4,Candle Geat gift.
4,11-Jun-19,5,"Great Candle Great gift, my friend loved it!  The fragrance was amazing and loved the packaging. Good quality candle and the scent wasn‚Äôt overpowering neither was it too faint."
4,11-Jun-19,4,Good Candles I actually think these candles are really nice. I just don't particularly like this scent. But it does fill the room nicely.
4,26-Jun-20,5,"So lovely! I LOVE this candle (Amber, Rose & Sheer Musk). It seriously smells amazing (even when it's not lit!). I have it on a table right next to my front door, and people make comments about it when I'm not even burning it. Going to buy more to have them on hand for gifts!"
4,14-Oct-20,4,"Spicy Wild Lemongrass Just got this candle, and lit that baby up!  I was surprised that the scent wasn't just lemony, but had a hint of spice at the end.  I have asthma and this did not irritate my lungs, as most other candles do."
4,8-Sep-20,5,"Smells Great! Bought this candle to use in a bathroom. It smells great! Really like the masculine scent of it, it is not too overpowering like some other candles can be."
4,12-May-20,5,"Great, manly candle If you want a manly smelling candle that is stong but subtle, this is your jam!  I love it and highly recommend it.  Going to buy more for sure"
4,12-Oct-19,5,Great scented candle I love lighting candles in the house and I decided to try a soy candle for the fact it burns slower and has intense fragrance. I love how this candle smelled in our condo! I will be purchasing these candles from now on!
4,8-Jun-20,5,"unique combination that works! I was a little skeptical of this scent combination--I like mostly clean scents, but I was pleasantly surprised. It definitely has a pina colada/tropical vibe, but it is not overpowering. It has filled up my kitchen and dining room with the smell of summer :)"
4,27-Jul-20,5,"Sneaky-good Seriously the best candle ever. The scent (espresso bean) is delicious, not overpowering, but definitely *there.* I have a hard time with many scented candles due to allergies, but this one bothers me not at all. Seems very slow-burning compared to others that I've tried as well."
4,17-Aug-20,5,Friend loves it! Gave this as a gift to a good friend and she was really pleased! The bamboo rose scent is very fresh and clean but not in a laundry/artificial way. Love that it's a soy candle too!
4,22-Jun-20,1,"Overall I dont recommend I tried the lavender scented candles. The scent is not pleasant but they do burn for a really long time. Instead of returning it I decided to take advantage of the ambience. Candle will not burn out quick so that's good.  Also, they were alot smaller than I anticipated."
4,18-Feb-19,5,Smells amazing Best smelling candle ever! Buy this. You won‚Äôt be disappointed. Never write reviews. Buy this.
4,27-Sep-20,5,"Gorgeous candle! I purchased the lemongrass scent and it smells amazing! Definitely made my whole living room & kitchen smell great and added a nice vibe to the whole house. Looks beautiful too with the simple, clean design."
4,24-Mar-20,5,Awesome little candle! I love the smell of this candle- Sandalwood alone is too strong for me so this one has subtle undertones of the jasmine with the overall smell of sandalwood.  Very nice and my husband liked the dark look of it in the dark glass container.  I'm going to add this to my list of things I give as gifts!
4,30-Jul-20,5,Super clean smell Love the smell ‚Äî¬†super clean but not overpowering. Great for a hit of spring or summer.
4,27-Feb-20,5,Very nice candle Candle smells great. Plan to get more.
4,30-Mar-19,4,"Wonderful Scent This candle smells wonderful! One of my coworkers gave it to me as a gift (the smaller size). Once that one was used up, I had to buy another one (larger size). However the larger one is not much bigger than the smaller one in my opinion. It‚Äôs a bit on the pricey side but again, I love the scent!"
4,24-Oct-18,5,Lovely fragrance in a beautiful jar I bought the lemongrass scent and it smells lovely without being overpowering. I lite it in my bathroom during a quick shower and the fragrance was all over my room by the time I was done without being too strong or sweet that would cause a headache like many other candles I‚Äôve had in the past.
4,8-Jun-20,5,Smells like a sexy man! :) Very happy I decided to purchase this candle it's small size makes it easy to take on my van travels and my wife loves it. Burns for a very long time and barely uses any of the wax. Smells so good! Will definitely purchase another Lulu Candle in the future.
4,10-Aug-19,5,"Smells so nice! Love this candle! Smells great, but not completely overwhelming. It burns for a long time and the cap is great for putting it out. Highly recommend!"
4,17-Sep-19,5,Yes to this candle Awesome aroma and strong scent but pleasant
4,22-Jul-20,5,Great candle! This candle is a great addition for my home office. The scent is great and relaxing and lasts.
4,26-Jan-20,5,Teens love candles She loved it!
4,26-Sep-20,3,"Very subtle scent, and sweeter then expected Scent is a bit sweeter than I hoped and little bit ""soap-ish"" smelling but actually a pretty nice scent overall. Unfortunately the scent is quite light when the candle is lit, so that's a bit disappointing."
4,20-May-20,5,Great smell smells like great male cologne. I love strong smell and im very happy with it.
4,17-Feb-20,3,Laundry room esc Smells a bit like a laundry room but if that‚Äôs what ur in for then it‚Äôs great and will go for a while!
4,27-May-20,5,"Lemon Biscotti 6 oz. Candle Holy crap, this candle smells AMAZING!! Within the first 3 minutes of lighting it the scent completely filled the room. It‚Äôs not overpowering, but the perfect amount of scent. I got lemon biscotti, my kitchen smells like a bakery now! It‚Äôs packaged so cute, would definitely be easy to gift!"
4,23-Nov-20,5,SMELLS SWEET BUT MANLY Perfect balance of sweet and manly.
4,3-May-20,5,"Smells great! I love the fresh smell of this candle. It is super cute. I wish it had a top to it, but other than that I would buy this again and also give as a gift. I can even smell it when it‚Äôs not burning, but it‚Äôs not too strong. Love it!"
4,11-Nov-20,3,Not very strong The scent is much more mild than I would like - it seems like it has to burn for at least 20mins for me to really smell it as opposed to other candles where I can sense it more quickly. It does seem long lasting however.
4,29-Jun-20,4,"Sexy Man smells sexy The candle smells good, I got Sexy Man. it does smell like cologne and has a sort of vanilla tone at the end, but it is not too sweet. I am a sexier man because of this candle. My room no longer smells of unsexy man. Minus one star because it is expensive."
4,16-Oct-20,5,Good & Chic candle The scent is so lovely from this candle I absolutely love it! And I love the black container itsnin as well. Very chic.
4,21-Feb-20,5,Great Candle I bought the Apple Cinnamon scent and it is great. It is not to strong and leave enough scent to give rid of any odors in the room. The candle keeps burning and doesn't seem to burn out quickly. Definitely recommend if you are looking for something subtle.
4,6-Jul-19,5,"Favorite candle ever! Smells like a blueberry cobbler is baking right in your kitchen. The smell is even BETTER after you light it. Doesn't irritate my sinuses or allergies, and is pretty slow burning. The only thing is that the jar is wide and you have to light it for 1-2 hours for it to burn evenly. Other than that I love this candle!!"
4,10-Jun-19,5,"Delicious Candle I ordered this candle based on a newspaper review, and I am very happy with it.  The scent is long lasting, and the candle burns slowly.  I am still enjoying it, so I'm not certain about longevity, but so far, its been a lovely addition to my room."
4,26-Feb-20,5,"Good Value Candle burns slow and has a noticeable, but not overpowering, scent. I will definitely purchase again as they seem to be a good value compared to other soy candles that can run you $30+ for a single candle of the same size."
4,5-Apr-19,5,"Smells awesome Honestly not much of a candle guy, but I like something that smells a bit manly. This definitely does the job. Smells excellent!"
4,16-Nov-20,5,"Fresh and delicious scent These are my absolutely favorite indoor candles.  I buy numerous at a time as I burn them daily.  The  aroma is fresh, light and clean. I  can't stand the fake smell of those yankee candles and this is exactly the opposite.  They las a long time too."
4,24-Jun-19,1,Smell is barely noticeable This candle was lit for like 5 hours and we never smelled it??
4,16-Apr-20,5,"Hands down, amazing I buy a lot of candles, and decided to choose this one recently since it was sold on Amazon.  So happy with the purchase, the scent, and the fact that it's a slow burning candle.  I will be purchasing more soon."
4,29-Nov-19,5,Pineapple Evergreen FTW I have tried a few of their scents and to me pineapple evergreen is easily the best I've discovered so far. It's unique and refreshing. I'm not a candle expert but they seem to last decently long and they burn evenly.
4,12-Apr-20,5,BUY IT I love the smell of this candle!! I bought it for my daughter for her birthday and she can‚Äôt stop smelling it! Every time I walk into her room she has it next to her burning it!! It even has an adorable box it comes with! The box smells amazing too! Definitely buys this!!
4,31-Jul-20,3,"Decent Smells good! Burns slow, scent has a weak throw not as strong as i expected."
4,15-Jun-20,5,"Sexy and unique This is my second purchase of this candle... it‚Äôs is the most amazing, sexy and unique scents. Every person who comes to my home immediately asks me ‚Äúwhat is that amazing candle?‚Äù..."
4,16-Jul-20,5,Great manly scent (Tobacco Spice & Vanilla) First off the candle smells amazing and the scent fills the room quickly.  The only honest downside of this candle is that at least mine burned quickly but I imagine that's because it's soy based.  I will definitely be ordering another one soon!  I highly recommend this candle.
4,17-Jun-20,5,"Potent and Powerful! These candles are incredibly strong! I currently have the Fresh Linen scent in a small closet, and it smells as if all of my clothes are freshly washed! The burn time on these candles is excellent, has wonderful packaging, and I would absolutely gift them to a friend!"
4,28-Jul-20,5,Our favorite candles! Came carefully wrapped and boxed. The scent is enough to fill the entire house and it smells so good!! We love that they're soy also with the cotton wick. Will definitely be ordering more ?üòç
4,7-Jul-20,5,"Amazing scent !!!! Obsessed! I honestly thought bath and body works were the only candles that give so much scent but honestly speaking, these candles Give waaay more scent. Theres times when I have the candle off and I still smell it as if its on. Smells sooooo Good !!! Definitely recommend them!"
4,26-Mar-20,5,"Smells absolutely amazing - good burn time I ordered Candle # 13, which is Amber Rose and Sheer Musk. It smells amazing and really fills the room well. I would definitely recommend this candle as a gift, because it looks great just sitting out on any table and has a simple aesthetic to it. Very happy with my purchase."
4,17-Jul-20,5,"Cozy A small candle with a large scent. We love having this candle lit in our home, it smells refreshing and we enjoy having it. We will be purchasing more."
4,30-Jun-20,5,great smelling candles?üëè?üèª this candle SMELLS SOOOO GOOD. i love how its soy based so it burns longer. totally worth my purchase and its the perfect size for my floating shelves. will definitely be purchasing another?üòã
4,24-Sep-19,5,"Amber,Rose & Musk Wow.Love Love LoveSoft & Sexy ScentI want More More More"
4,3-Apr-20,5,Great candle I got the Wild Lemongrass and the scent is great.  Not too powerful but definitely noticeable.  Will be trying others from this company.
4,2-Sep-20,5,A great gift! Bought the espresso scented one and it smells just like walking into a coffee shop! Well worth the price and a very nice candle!
4,30-May-20,5,"Too quality, most fragrant I have been purchasing candles for my wife for a decade now.  Lulu has one of the cleanest, most fragrant smelling you will ever burn inside your home.  I just made the Nag Champa purchase that has become her absolute favorite -  top quality.  Would recommend and will be purchasing more."
4,18-Dec-18,5,"Good quality candle The candle smells great, looks great, and is made of soy so I won't get cancer. Great gift for anyone."
4,3-Aug-20,3,The candle was nicely packaged I was surprised at the cost of the candle for the size of the candle.  We have not yet burned it to see how long it will last.
4,30-Jun-20,5,"Love the Lemongrass scent! I've never been a big fan or aromatherapy, but this won me over. I'm very pleased with the lemongrass scent, and I'm looking forward to trying out new scents in the future! Will definitely buy again soon!"
4,4-Sep-19,4,"Smells great, strong but not overpowering Although this candle is pricey the quality is worth it. I got the pineapple evergreen. It‚Äôs a perfect fall scent especially if you‚Äôre trying to get away from cinnamon or pumpkin smells . Definitely recommend it!"
4,8-Nov-20,5,"This Candle is the One You Want! Incredible scent - very pleasing but not overpowering. I was impressed with how long the candle lasted, and I look forward to trying other scents. A fantastic candle for a steal of a price."
4,2-Sep-20,5,"Freshest scent! I got the two pack of Pineapple Evergreen and it is a wonderful scent for the home. Great for summer or fall. The packaging is nice, very modern and chic. Will try new scents next time too."
4,4-Nov-20,5,Just like a coffee shop This candle is AMAZING! It smells exactly like a coffee shop which is what I was looking for! My house smells so delicious!! I love the way it was packaged as well! I will be getting more!!
4,3-Mar-20,5,The candle smells are natural and relaxing! They make my house smell clean even when they're not lit.
4,27-Sep-19,1,Wrong fragrance Got the wrong fragrance. Changed from 6 ounce to 9 ounce and it automatically changed the fragrance without me noticing it
4,17-Feb-20,4,scent too strong For me the scent was too strong but I like how the package is cute and the scent lasts long enough.
4,15-May-20,5,Sweet and delicious coffee scented candle I can‚Äôt say enough positive things about this candle! The scent is definitely my favorite part. The coffee aroma is sweet and delicious. Will definitely purchase other scents.
4,29-Sep-20,5,"Great Candle! I bought this for myself and it's a great scent for the holiday season. I was surprised by how good it smells! After reading all of the reviews, I had to try it. I bought pineapple evergreen and I highly recommend it!"
4,6-Feb-20,5,Beautiful Lasting Smell! I am very pleased with this candle. I put in a search on Amazon for the best smelling candles and have always loved the Lemongrass scent!! I will purchase again for gifts for birthdays or Christmas. LULU will be my go to candle. Thank you!!
4,7-May-20,5,"Amazing Candle! This is a great candle and it smells great! Although I was expecting the candle to be alittle bigger or a stronger scent for the price of the candle, This is an amazing gift and grat candle to keep around the house, bedroom, bathroom and even dorm room at school."
4,13-Nov-20,5,"If you know what Kopiko coffee candy tastes like, this is exactly what it would smell like! I haven't used it for long, but the smell right out the box is crazy good! I don't usually buy candles because they can be too strong for me, but I'm really happy that this was not the case. Once I run out, I'm definitely going to buy another one."
4,1-Oct-20,5,Yummy smell The candle was smaller than i thought it would be but they smell so good. I got a tobacco spice and an apple cinnamon ?üòã  im burning the apple one now. They seem to slow burn which i like because they are lasting! I will be getting these 2 always.
4,24-Jun-20,5,"Finally, a candle that works! I am in love with the first candle that I've purchased. The scent throw is on point and you can smell the candle from across the room. It's worth the price because it works. I will definitely order again."
4,16-Jan-20,5,Long lasting This is a fantastic candle! I ordered two and just ordered two more. They burn for a very long time and the scent is lovely!! Will continue to order!
4,10-Sep-20,4,"Great Smell! I ordered the Clean Linen and it was a fantastic smell! Doesn't last quite as long as some other candles I've purchased, but very good candle. The wick lights easily as well."
4,26-Sep-20,2,"The smell is the best but arrived at my door chipped with chipped glass :( The best smelling candle ever - perfect balance of tobacco and vanilla. It‚Äôs not too vanilla-ey. Unisex candle. I however, couldn‚Äôt use mine because the glass came cracked :("
4,10-Jun-20,5,Great Candle - Better for indoors than traditional bees wax candles This candle/company is awesome! My sister has this candle and I stole it used it all then bought us 2 more. Soy candles are particularly great for indoors because the smoke output doesn't build up on the walls. Great buy!
4,18-Oct-20,1,"So Gross This scent is toxic and smells like chemical soap.  After twenty minutes of lighting this, the entire apartment smelled like horrible cleaning products.  Also started TASTING chemicals in my mouth.  Immediately blew it out and threw it away.  Do not buy."
4,25-Jun-19,5,"Pineapple Evergreen! The pineapple evergreen candle candle is amazing! I tried it based on other reviews, and was not disappointed. It smells so good and the scent fills the entire room, but is not too strong or overpowering. The label and jar are very simple and fit in well with any decor. Would recommend to everyone!"
4,22-Feb-19,5,Lasts a long time I was looking for a slow burning candle that smelled good and this one fits the bill!!!  Love the smell and I've been burning it every night for several days and it's still over 1/2 full!  This is a great value and this is now my go to candle.
4,29-Mar-20,4,"Love the way it looks. Nice scent. Got here quickly and packaged great. Cool, minimalist design. It‚Äôs a lovely scent!!! Only issue is that it‚Äôs not as strong as I‚Äôd like. Want to try a different scent now."
4,13-Apr-20,5,"Smell, yet mighty! The fresh linen scent is absolutely terrific. I was a bit surprised by the size of the candle upon opening the box, however, this candle is not to disappoint. The scent has filled my 600 square foot apartment beautifully and I will most definitely purchase this again."
4,9-Jan-20,3,Smells good Great candle smells nice however the burn is pathetic
4,8-Mar-20,5,"Great candle! This is my third Lulu candle. As usual, a unique, rich, pleasant aroma that lasts and lasts. These are a better value than buying multiples of cheaper, chemically smelling candles."
4,11-Sep-19,1,Wish I‚Äôd had gotten different scent Will not purchase scent was not strong at all
4,31-Oct-19,5,"Pleasing / Not Overpowering Good candle. It's smaller than I expected, but the scent is very pleasing and is not too overpowering. Haven't used it enough to comment on longevity."
4,9-Jun-20,5,"Smells So Good! I wanted a candle for the bathroom off of my kitchen, and this espresso bean candle is perfect. It smells amazing. Not overpowering at all for a small room. I love it."
4,16-Nov-19,5,Delightful! I love this candle! I have burned it nearly non stop since purchasing and it looks like it's hardly been used. It has a noticeable yet subtle fragrance. Definitely will purchase again.
4,3-Nov-20,5,"Mary Jane I ordered the Mary Jane scented candle. I love it! I am going to order more for Christmas gifts for loved ones!!! Super happy with this product! Curious on total burning hours, as I‚Äôm just fresh into this candle! Amazing so far!!!"
4,11-Aug-20,5,"Fantastic smelling candle Honestly, this is the best candle I have ever owned. The smell is amazing. It lasts a long time. No  black soot on my walls. I have ordered this candle in threes, four times and will keep ordering them. This is an amazing product."
4,17-Sep-20,3,"Smells great - but lots of unused product I did like the fragrance, but was very disappointed with longevity. The metal part at the base of the wick stopped the candle from burning at least 1/2"" of product left in the based. Very disappointed for the price."
4,24-Mar-20,5,Amazing. Solid. Masculine. Love it. I am super picky with my candles as its hard to find a masculine scent that is strong enough but also isn‚Äôt going to overpower the room. This candle has a very elegant yet manly aroma with the perfect amount of strength. I won‚Äôt be buying another candle again.
4,21-Mar-20,5,Strong yet breathable This is legitimately one of the highest quality candles I‚Äôve ever owned. I will purchase this scent again and again. My home smells awesome!
4,26-Jan-20,5,Apple Cinnamon My wife has bought 3 of the apple cinnamon FURR candles. We love them. You actually get the apple cinnamon sent while the candles are burning. We've placed them around the house so we get the sent throughout the house. We also love that the purchases help animals in need.
4,3-Jun-20,4,"I wish it was bigger Upon opening smells really good. Looking forward to see how long it actually  burns. I got the 6oz, lemon and vanilla  bean."
4,18-May-20,5,"Really nice candles I bought pineapple/evergreen and wild lemongrass candles and I love both the scents. The pineapple is sweet but not over-powering. So far the candles are burning evenly and slowly. Looking forward to trying other scents next, love the selection."
4,27-Sep-20,5,"Nice look, strong and pleasant scent The pineapple evergreen scent is really nice! I don't get very much of the 'evergreen' coming through but it is a truly pleasant scent - and strong (in a good way). I put mine in my bathroom and it freshens the whole room even when it's not lit."
4,18-Sep-20,5,"Long and Warming Scent! This candle is not only MUCH healthier for any household, but it smells incredible and lasts a super long time. The apple cinnamon reminds us of the holidays and there is no better way to kick off the holiday season than burning the lulu candle!"
4,25-Apr-20,5,"Powerful and amazing scent I purchased the 6 oz cedarwood infused mango because of my curiosity in the uniqueness of the candle's scent name. I have to say, I am amazed at the power and deliciousness of the scent! Will definitely be trying out other scents from Lulu's Candles."
4,20-Oct-20,1,Safety I called the company and asked them if these candles are safe considering my mother has asthma. I purchased as a gift. They recommenced not purchasing or using.  Not pure essential oils.
4,10-Sep-20,5,20/10 Like the smell of Starbucks? Then your going to LOVE this! Phew it smells perfect! Very sweet and mocha!
4,7-May-20,5,"clean and fresh with a hint of sweetness I normally don't go for any tropical type scents because they can be overpowering, but this combination is crisp and clean. I've had several guests ask where they can get theirs as well!"
4,2-Oct-20,4,"Great scent Arrived on time. Great scent, nice jar. Only issue would be that the jar is not wide enough and the wax pools too much for the wick to burn. I have to keep removing the excess or the wick will go out."
4,30-May-20,5,"Lavender musk scent calms you instantly! I loved the lavender musk scent and was also impressed that each purchase gives to such a great cause. Also a plus that this product is made in America! Looking forward to seeing how long the candle lasts, as my family goes through them pretty quickly."
4,17-Oct-20,3,Small Tho it was good candle it‚Äôs very very small. To expensive for the amount.
4,25-Jan-20,5,"2nd Purchase, still obsessed! This candle's scent is masculine with sweet notes. It's amazing and I love the long-lasting and lingering smell it has. It might seem small, but I can smell it in my whole apartment, well after it's been extinguished."
4,31-May-20,5,"Smells great! Great for a gift, smells really good. Was delivered fast will definitely buy again."
4,10-Sep-20,5,birthday  gift for mom smelled just like cake. My mom loved it
4,11-Jun-20,2,"#14 smell made me sick I just wasted $20 on the horrible #14 candle. I like the lemongrass candle so I thought I would try #14 because it has Jasmine and Sandalwood. It smells like an old powdery grandmother's house, It doesn't smell at all like Jasmine. I HATE it and it gave me a headache very quickly."
4,28-May-20,4,Best Fresh & Clean candle! Amazing smell! Best fresh & clean scent I have ever found in a candle. We have been trying to cover up pet smells while training a new puppy and it has been amazing. The only downfall is that it seems to burn quite fast - but that may be because I have it lit so much!
4,4-Nov-20,4,Smaller than I thought. Great smelling candle. Smaller then I thought for the price.Will update after I lite it.
4,28-Aug-20,5,"So pretty This candle smells so pretty. Not to strong, smells clean and fresh. I am giving it as a gift."
4,7-Feb-20,5,"LOVE IT!! House smells like an amazing coffee shop! We read the reviews and thought this product was best to get a real good coffee smell, and it does!  WE love it!!! Great scent, really awesome quality! and lasts well! Wish we could buy in bulk!!!"
4,30-Apr-19,5,It smells so good! I like clean scents that aren't too overpowering but you can still notice them. This fit the bill!
4,22-May-20,1,Waste of money Waste of money. No Odor at all.
4,3-Feb-20,5,Smells great Great gift
4,16-Nov-20,5,"Best Candle I feel like I am getting the quality of Nest or Diptyque for the price of Yankee Candle, to put it into perspective. Definitely worth it- loyal customer. If there was a membership/ Monthly Subscription I would be the first one to sign up for it"
4,16-Sep-20,5,I love it!!!! I love the scent!!!! And it‚Äôs burning slow and smooth! Will definitely order more!!!!
4,10-Dec-19,5,"Gift-worthy and smells great! Bought this as a gift for a friend and -- not having lit it up yet -- it smells amazing, nothing like those really overpowering BB&B or Yankee Candle scents (no offense). I'm glad that I found such a nice soy candle to buy over a wax/paraffin one because of all its environmental and health benefits!"
4,31-Aug-19,1,Very small I thought this was a 3 wick.  It's tiny.  Not worth the money.
4,3-Apr-20,4,"Strong long-lasting scents I ordered several of these candles. I am impressed with how strong the scent is and how long it lingers in my house. I don‚Äôt love the scents as much as some higher end candles I‚Äôve had, but for the convenience of amazon delivery they‚Äôll do!"
4,30-Dec-19,5,Don't Hesitate! Just Get It! I wanted a new scent for my house. I wanted something that was versatile because my house is small and all the living spaces will share the same scent. The vanilla oak smells great! The oak gives it a modern twist to the classic vanilla scent. I will definitely be trying more of these candles.
4,21-Sep-20,5,"Fresh Linen for a Fresh Home! Purchased the fresh linen for the smell - wanted to start fall off with candles but don't love the strong scents so I went with this one. Definitely recommend - smells so clean, the candle is the perfect size for a bathroom or bedroom. Love it!"
4,8-Feb-19,5,"Nice strong scent This candle smells awesome!  Although a bit smaller than expected, it's a great candle due to the fact of the strong and pleasant scent."
4,13-Dec-19,5,Perfect for gift Perfect for gift
4,24-Aug-20,5,Awesome Scent... Family Favorite Lulu candles are neat looking and smell great! Pineapple Evergreen is a family favorite. The combination of pineapple and evergreen might sound a bit odd but is awesome :)
4,18-May-20,5,Great Scent and Lasts I was surprised how much I really liked this scent (Sexy Man) and the candle does last slightly longer than some other soy candles I have. I sometimes pour the melted wax onto my hands to lotion them. Good buy and you might be pleasantly surprised like I was.
4,11-Jul-19,5,Smell is spot on The smell is fabulous!  Arrived on time and is exactly as pictured!  Thank you
4,25-Sep-19,5,Smells great! Smells really pleasantly nice. Ordered this twice as of this review.
4,13-Jun-19,1,"WORST SMELL EVER This smells like you walked into a casino on bingo night and encountered a mass of really old people all smelling like the same strong, cheap perfume. Once you smell it, you can't get it out of your scent. It's the WORST. #barfemojiI guess this is what I get from buying candles online lol."
4,6-Feb-20,5,New Scents Very refreshing.  Excellent Customer Service.
4,10-Oct-20,5,"Beautiful candle- great gift!! This candle is so cute and dainty!! It smells amazing and isn‚Äôt too overpowering, but is definitely there. I got it as a gift for my Birthday and I loved it! ?üòå Will definitely be ordering another!!"
4,23-Aug-20,1,"No smell! I put this candle in my living room and I hardly smell anything! Not worth the price, it smells just like a candle I could get from the dollar store. Very disappointed! Money wasted!!!"
4,14-Apr-20,5,Smells delicious! This candle smells so good! The whole house smells like blueberry cobble. The best part is that it burns slowly and the smell lasts a long time. Will definitely be buying more!
4,21-Oct-20,5,"Small size but seems can burn for a long time Got a pineapple and espresso bean ones. The candle size is small, but it does say slow burning. I light it for three hours, only burnt a little bit, smells good too.I love the packages."
4,25-Nov-19,5,Gentle scent I usually get headaches from scented candles but this one has such a gentle simple scent that does not make me sick. Comes in a lovely packaging just as pictured.
4,20-Jun-20,4,"Smells better than any candle I've ever had! Rarely write reviews and only lit this candle once, but (I got the lemongrass scent) the scent is so distinct and visible in the best way I am so looking forward to this candle. It also looks really nice - I love having it out even if not lit."
4,24-Mar-20,5,"Delicious smelling candle + long lasting scent I love love love lulu candles! I've tried so many different scents of theirs and none of them disappoint! I LOVE the blueberry cobbler candle. I definitely have a candle problem now, but the only negative I have to say is that I wish they were available in bigger sizes!"
4,11-Apr-20,4,"Lovely overall but a little pricey. Lovely smell.  Soy candles burn ""cleaner "" and longer."
4,6-Sep-19,5,"Loved it - Pineapple Evergreen smelled so good I loved this candle - soy candles do last longer than default candles, and it‚Äôs nice to support a small business. The pineapple evergreen smelled really good - but pretty strong, so I recommend it in a larger room because it‚Äôll cover a large area."
4,24-Apr-20,5,Smells fresh and clean I really enjoyed the clean fresh smell of this candle. It leaves my room smelling amazing and I always get compliments from my mom when she comes in my room. Very great smelling candle. Would recommend!
4,1-Jun-20,5,Awesome Candles! I originally was gifted Sexy Man so I wanted to see what other scents you guys had. I checked out Pineapple Evergreen and thought it was a weird combo but took the chance because there were so many good reviews. I'm glad I did! Awesome smell and these candles last!
4,14-Apr-20,5,"High quality and very fragrant High quality candles - 5 stars! I‚Äôve bought the blueberry cobbler and the lemon vanilla. Both smell absolutely delicious, fragrant, and long-lasting. What more could you ask for from a candle?!"
4,10-Sep-20,5,Love the clean smell! I love that the candle isn't overpowering in smell but the scent itself is so nice! It was packaged nicely too. I appreciate that it is a soy candle too which is safer. Would recommend and plan on buying from them in the future
4,25-Sep-19,4,"NIce long lasting candle Good candle, burns slowly as advertised. It is 6oz so it is small. Good gift idea for under $15. Scent could have been a bit stronger for me but overall I'm happy with the purchase."
4,20-Aug-20,5,Must buy! If you‚Äôre thinking about which candle scent to purchase Pineapple Evergreen is the perfect one! The smell reminds me of a perfect transition from Summer to Fall especially since I live in the PNW. Don‚Äôt hesitate!
4,21-Nov-20,5,"A scented candle for grown ups I bought this candle with the intent on giving it away as a holiday gift. When I opened it up, I found the scent inspired my curiosity as to what Sheer Musk smelled like. So I lit the candle, and I love it. Now I have to buy more. Both for me, and for gifts."
4,7-Feb-20,5,Very strong sent lovely I'm what you would say is a candle junkie I'm always burning them but I never can find one that is strong and last long but this one is on a hole new level of strong I'm definitely buying more it's great highly recommend
4,20-Mar-20,5,Great smelling candle. Great smelling scent.
4,13-Feb-20,5,Clean burn and long lasting smell I really like the Amber Rose and Sheer Musk fragrance candles. They are great for small spaces especially for bathrooms. They are kind of pricey $20 for a 9oz candle jar (without lid) but I'm repurchasing this one for its long lasting fragrance and the clean burn.
4,22-Jul-20,5,What's that? Pineapple and evergreen you say?... I saw all the reviews on the pineapple evergreen and thought what the heck?  WHY would you put those two smells together??  Boy was I wrong!! It is amazeballs!!  It's a perfect mix between fruity and woodsy.  I will definitely order more.
4,6-Oct-20,5,"Best scented candle ever!!! The candle is beautiful, not to mention the awe inspiring scent. It's been over a month and I use it often and it the longevity of the scent is still like Day #1. Will purchase again!"
4,31-Jan-20,5,Scent is Amazing My daughter loved her candle.
4,22-Nov-19,5,"Lovely candle for the price, will buy again! I bought two candels, one for me and one as a gift which went down really well. Having used it, I think it's a nice candle, the label looks really nice on the glass container. The scent is really lovely, but could be a bit stronger. For the price, great value for money."
4,14-Jan-20,5,Organic smell ! Absolutely love this candle ! It enlightens my senses and my heart !
4,3-Jan-20,5,"The smell will quickly fill a room. Love this candle, the scent is pure Fresh Linen!"
4,25-May-20,5,"Great Scent! Great scent, just as described. Giving the ""fresh linen"" as a gift."
4,17-Dec-19,5,"Great scent and long lasting! (Sexy Man Scent) I have been burning this candle on separate occasions, for an hour or so each time... The scent is just the right amount  of strong, I have the 6 oz and it fills an approximately 200 sq ft room in a matter of minutes. I can tell this candle is going to last a long time! Awesome!"
4,30-Jun-20,5,Great candles! I LOVE these candles. They last a really long time and smell great.
4,2-Sep-20,5,"paris candle the paris candle is so adorable and the smell is so divine. Bought it for my daughters quince. The theme is Paris. The candle is really nice, fancy, and the smell sure does last a long time. Great quality for a great price. I would defiantly purchase again."
4,6-Apr-20,5,"Beautiful Candle, Beautiful Scent I love the fresh linen scent.  It is light and airy - and not too sweet.  It fills my house with a subtle fragrance.  These candles are excellent quality and very giftable.  They have good longevity, too."
4,14-Dec-19,5,"Buy it! It‚Äôs one of those names ‚ÄúSexy Man‚Äù and you immediately think it‚Äôs probably some over-powering, cheap, drugstore quality scent like ‚ÄúNight Swept‚Äù etc, but it is a very warm, inviting, 3 dimensional scent with just the right hints of sugar, spice, and everything nice!"
4,18-Feb-20,5,Pineapple Evergreen FTW My friend recommended this scent to me when I told her I was after a long-lasting fresh holiday candle. It was perfect! I already bought a replacement.
4,29-May-20,4,"Nice candle I purchased the, ""Sexy Man"" candle for my friend as a gift. It is very well made and has a pleasant cologne smell to it, without it being too overwhelming (there is a nice hint of vanilla to it). I am pleased with how well it was made, and it shipped very quickly."
4,21-Jan-20,5,"Great scent It comes in a cute jar, I do wish that there was a lid to put out the flame because I don't like blowing out the flame and having that smoke scent. The scent is amazing, I had it lit for not even 10 minutes and it already was smelling up the room, the throw of this candle is just amazing"
4,1-Jun-20,5,AMAZING SCENT I gave the candle to a co-worker as a birthday gift. It smells a-m-a-z-i-n-g!  She loved it. I'm definitely going to purchase one for myself.
4,4-Nov-20,5,"Great scent This is a lovely candle with a strong lovely scent, I highly recommend it."
4,29-Jun-20,3,"strong, lasting smell The candle scent is very potent, which can be either good or bad depending on how much you like the smell of your candle and how sensitive you are to overstimulated senses. The candle size is perfect and it burns slowly to last a long while."
4,18-Feb-20,5,Awesome candle Awesome candle
4,27-Jun-20,5,"The best smelling candle since Anthro's candle line. This candle smells AMAZING.It doesn't smell overwhelming cologne heavy and it's the perfect scent in any room‚Äîliving room, bathroom, bedroom, kitchen etc.I will definitely be reordering for myself and gifting it to others as well! :)"
4,10-Apr-20,1,"Worst candle ever! I‚Äôm so disappointed with this candle!  The wick doesn‚Äôt hold a flame, it burns out in 15 minutes.This candle was NOT cheap, the quality is terrible.I‚Äôll never buy another one from this company.It doesn‚Äôt even burn!"
4,28-Dec-19,5,Great Candle! I love the scent of this candle and it doesn't need to burn all day to scent the house.  Just a lovely candle and will last much longer since an hour burn each day is all that is needed.  Scent is nice and fresh not overpowering.
4,15-Mar-20,5,"Magnificent Odor Vanquished I am visiting family and there are two Great Danes living in the porch; they are beautiful. However, the large dog smell was getting to me and this wild lemongrass candle tackles and vanquishes the odor!! Yes!"
4,11-Apr-20,5,"Fantastic manly scent My husband bought me this candle for our anniversary and I absolutely love it! I love ‚Äòman‚Äô smells in candles - sandlewood, tobacco, etc. Yummy! This lives up to all those delicious smell ideals ?üòä And I love the black and white minimalist design."
4,19-Mar-20,5,"Smells exactly as described I bought this as a bathroom/bedroom candle, and the candle smells exactly like fresh linen as advertised. The label and jar are modern and sleek. Also, the candle burns well and is lasting quite well. I would definitely try another scent and replace this one when done."
4,19-Apr-20,5,Great candle! Lovely candle! Smells just like the description and you can smell it throughout a very large room. We light ours in our kitchen/living room area and it permeates the entire space! It‚Äôs also very slow burning so it will last for quite some time! Highly recommend!
4,2-Sep-20,5,Good candle Purchased the lavender scented candle and this seems to be one of the better candles I have found on amazon. Inexpensive and the candle scent you choose is not overbearing. Will try other scents after this one.
4,9-Jun-20,2,"Powerful smell The smell was very powerful, not quite for me."
4,18-Jun-20,5,small candle it‚Äôs very small compared to the bath and body works candle. for the price i feel like it should‚Äôve been bigger but i wanted to see how well it burned. i will be back later to confirm how well it did.
4,24-Jun-20,5,Sexy Man #16 - YES PLEASE!!! Smells AMAZING!!!  The label is super fun. I love how white the candle it. So clean!  And I also love the glass container!  Buy this ?üíØ
4,22-Apr-20,3,"Good quality, not the best scent I purchased the wild lemon grass scent.  The smell isn‚Äôt what I expected, it reminds me of the citronella candles we use in the summer.  I haven‚Äôt purchased any other lemongrass candles so I can‚Äôt compare it to anything else.  The candle itself is good quality and burns for a long time."
4,3-Oct-20,5,Worth the money! I bought 4 Lulu candles and every single one was amazing.  The scents were all pleasing and powerful but not overpowering.  They also look great too and I would totally give them as gifts.
4,30-Jun-20,5,Best smelling candle ever!! This candles scent is absolutely amazing.  The longevity of the burn time is great. I will only buy these candles now. I'm obsessed ?üòç
4,29-Sep-19,5,"Cute gift Great little gift. Smells great but not overpowering. I like that it's not heavily floral or ""feminine."" I bought this after smelling it in a friend's house. I just wish it was a bit bigger - I don't think it will last long."
4,8-Sep-20,5,Best candle I‚Äôve ever bought Literally the best smelling candle I‚Äôve ever owned. I burned it for a whole day and barely put a dent in it and my apartment smells heavenly. I‚Äôm so obsessed. My new go to candle!!!
4,29-Mar-20,5,Smells great! Great presentation and awesome smell. Just got it and am hoping it is also long lasting. Lots of great scents to choose from. Perfect price point for teacher gifts!
4,25-May-20,5,"Don't pass this one up! I am a candle fanatic, these are excellent! The Wild Lemongrass smells great cold, right out of the box. When burning, you can smell it all around the house! I am a repeat buyer and will continue to keep these on hand!"
4,14-Sep-20,4,Candle It has adequate scent
4,23-Nov-20,5,Love this scent! Absolutely love the jasmine and lily scent! It reminds me of a bubble bath scent I had when I was a little kid. I also love the minimalist design. Very good quality candles. Makes a perfect gift for a girlfriend with some added bath salts and a good book!
4,3-Nov-19,5,"Very pleased! I got the Pretty Woman scent - it smells sweet and musky. The smell is not overpowering but it still fills our living room in a cozy way. I'm really pleased with this purchase! I was considering some other candles from local artistic/plant shops, and would say the smell and quality of is really comparable."
4,28-Jul-20,5,Tiny cute great smelling candle! Smellis awesomeSuper small
4,5-Jun-19,4,"Lovely candle with a powerful scent A fabulous candle with a lovely powerful scent. Only con, way too many labels on candle."
4,30-Jun-19,5,"Fresh, Clean and Lovely Love this candle and will order more.  Great summer scent as is fresh and clean yet enough scent to cover household odors and doggie odors"
4,7-Feb-19,5,Great scent It it the best smelling candle before I knew how much I loved the espresso scent now I captive without it. I've ordered larger ones and still didnt fill the room the way this one did. Now i order them in bulk. Great product!
4,27-Apr-20,5,SMELLS AMAZING! This candle is absolutely wonderful and probably my favorite candle on the market.I highly recommend. The scent is very cozy but not too overpowering.Can't wait to order another one!
4,17-Sep-20,5,"Only one complaint The smell is fantastic, the longevity is great, the packaging is SO cute. My only issue is that the candle does not come in a bigger size!!! lol I really wish this was available in a bigger jar."
4,24-Jun-20,3,"If you‚Äôre hesitant, don‚Äôt buy I‚Äôm a little bummed the scent is sweeter than I expected and it did not come with a lid. I will not purchase again. Voluspa has better candles at a better price point for the size."
4,18-Jan-20,4,Send out as a gift Send out as a gift
4,5-Dec-19,5,"House smelled like a cozy coffee shop This candle smelled amazing, a couple of times I forgot it was lit and thought my husband was making coffee or baking cookies. We kept it burning constantly and it lasted quite a while. Have already ordered more from Lulu's, can't wait to smell the ""sexy man"" scent! :-)"
4,3-Apr-19,5,Great scent This candle has a great scent of pineapple evergreen. The jar is nice and it lasts a very long time. Love it!
4,4-Oct-20,5,"Candle Snob I constantly have a candle burning in my home and am very picky about my scents.  My ""go to"" scents are Yankee Eucalyptus and DW Lavender Chamomile.  Until now-I have added Pineapple Evergreen to my list.  I can't wait to try more scents.  I'm impressed."
4,16-Jun-20,5,Smells amazing and lasts longer than I expected Usually the best smelling candles seem to burn too fast.  This one smelled great and lasted for a long time.  Not the cheapest of the bunch but a great value for money because you get what you pay for.  I think we're going to be buying many more Lulu candles in the future.
4,14-Nov-20,5,Great Candle! I have been buying for decades. This is by far my favorite candle. Last forever. You only have to burn it for a few minutes to get the full effect. Great price. Just ordered 2 more. You will love this candle.
4,23-Jul-20,5,Strong scent I‚Äôm rewriting my review. I was quick to judge by its size. But after listing it I‚Äôm happily surprised with its scent. Even though I wish it were a tad bit stronger. It is better than the last five candles I‚Äôve bought. Worth the price!
4,26-May-20,5,Refreshibg scent during quarantine This candle smells amazing. Not overbearing but still packed with scent. Doesnt lose scent after being burned for a bit like other candles. The only thing is that iI wish I would have ordered a larger one because I love it so much.
4,9-Oct-19,4,"Smells great- poorly packaged Purchased this as a gift so I cannot speak on longevity, but it smells fantastic. The box was either sent to me beat up or it happened during delivery. Either way, not the condition you want to give a gift in."
4,8-Apr-20,5,Just what I was looking for! Really liking the scent of this candle so far. Just got it today and have been burning it all day and almost looks the same as when I got it. I can tell it will last a long time. I'll definitely be returning for more and checking out other candles from this brand!
4,18-Dec-19,5,This Scent is Wonderful This is the 5th order I have placed as I have become somewhat addicted to this scent.  I have also provided a few to friends as gifts and the Amber Rose/Sheer Musk scent seems to get high marks from even the most critical candle users.  Worth writing home about.
4,18-Jul-19,5,"SMELLS WONDERFUL This candle smells AMAZING. Can‚Äôt comment on the longevity yet as I just received it today, but already my home smells delightful. That‚Äôs saying something as I have three large dogs. Most scented candles aren‚Äôt powerful enough to make a real difference in my house, this one is great and super aromatic."
4,22-Jul-20,5,My candle of choice Smells great and burns slowly. Would highly recommend this product!
4,18-May-20,5,Great smell!!! The smell is amazing! Candle burns nicely and seems to last! Perfect little gift for someone.
4,4-Nov-20,4,They are a nice candle The aroma is not overwhelming and burns nicely:)
4,15-Jul-20,5,"Great candle The candle is small, but really does burn slowly and lasts just as long as my larger candles. I love the scent, highly recommend."
4,31-Oct-19,5,"I‚Äôve bought this a couple times Great scent. Not super strong, but it is good for a room"
4,26-Jun-20,5,Great smell and great gift! I got this as a gift for my sister's birthday and she was so happy with the candle! She loves the scent and would buy it again when she runs out. It smells and looks expensive and I love the fact that it's a soy candle. Will definitely be buying this for myself as well!
4,11-Jun-20,5,Smell is incredible! Bought the Happy Birthday candle for a friend's birthday. The Buttercream Vanilla Cupcake scent is so good that you want to take a bite out of the candle! My friend thought the same. Great purchase.
4,13-Feb-20,4,"Long lasting and makes a great gift I have never had this brand of candle and was anxious to try it. It‚Äôs ideal for the kitchen counter.I was a little disappointed in the strength of the scent.  It has a weak scent and is difficult tosmell it, but appears as if it will be a longer glowing candle than many I have had."
4,24-Nov-18,5,LOVE THEM! Love love love these phenomenal scented candles. My friends enjoy them too! Pleasant and non-overwhelming scents-candles that are just right!
4,11-Apr-20,1,No smell after burning for two hours The two soy candles spiced vanilla and crumb cake basically have no fragrance or smell after burning for over two hours. Over the years I have used many different type of soy candles and wanted to try this brand. Not a wise decision on my part.
4,10-Nov-19,1,"Fake reviews, bad scent, tunneling. Be aware of fake reviews. People will receive a small candle after reviewing.Bad scent, and tunnels a lot. I do not recommend this company to anyone."
4,15-Jun-20,5,Amazing Candles I absolutely love these candles. They smell so good without being overpowering. I've ordered the Pineapple one and the Rose and Amber. They last a long time too! I will definitely be buying these instead of Yankee Candles.
4,22-Aug-19,5,"Almost weird how good it smells Damn does this bad boy smell good. Like, it smells REAL good. I can't believe I'm saying this but I highly recommend a pineapple evergreen candle I randomly bought on the Internet."
4,4-May-20,5,"Give me more. Buyers remorse that it‚Äôs smaller than I‚Äôd hoped, but that‚Äôs obviously my own fault. Smells delicious and immediately filled the room. Never bought candles online before and am very happy. The scent is great."
4,18-Oct-20,5,"Small, but mighty I was initially skeptical with the small size of the candle, but the burn time is impressive. The scent is strong but not too overpowering so that I only really needed to burn it for an hour or so before it filled my 1 bedroom apartment."
4,25-May-20,5,"Quality scented candle I had previously received a birthday cake candle from this company and decided to order this one. I love the scent, not overpowering but really nice. The wick is durable and can be easily relit. The melted wax fills in evenly so you're not stuck with a large gap in the middle."
4,9-Jul-19,5,Pineapple and Evergreen... my favorite. This candle smells amazing! Pineapple and evergreen are an oddly perfect combination. I appreciate that the tin lid has a little silicone gasket around the edge which keeps the glass jar in good shape without chips and the lid stays on firmly. It‚Äôs beautifully packaged!
4,2-Feb-20,5,"#14 AWESOMENESS IN A JAR! Awesome scent of this #14 candle, Jasmine, Oud & Sandlewood! First of its kind in my collection of soy candles. Will def. buy more, again & again!"
4,10-Aug-20,5,"Bought it twice !! The candle smells great, it was nice and subtle not too overpowering, and they last pretty long. Ended up MUCH more economical than those store-bought candles that burnout within a day.. Overall I was very happy with my purchases!"
4,19-May-20,5,Great buy! I ordered the black amber candle and it smells amazing! Clean fresh scent. Love this style of these candles! Will buy more!
4,3-Dec-19,5,Amazing candles. I purchased a second candle (crumb cake) and have previously purchased pineapple evergreen. Both smell amazing and are very strong (though not overwhelming) and can fill our entire open-layout first floor. Will absolutely not hesitate to purchase again and again.
4,1-Mar-20,5,We‚Äôve been wanting a coffee candle A little more vanilla and less strong black coffee than I wanted but so happy to find a coffee candle. My mom has been wanting one forever. Great gift and still smells good .
4,7-Apr-20,5,Best smelling candle I've owned This is one of the absolute best smelling candles I have ever owned.  I buy one of these every month and it's well worth the investment.  I would also highly recommend the Fresh Linen Scent
4,4-Jan-19,5,The BEST Candle! My wife & I have been looking for good candles especially after burning all the Holiday ones from Bath & Body Works. Seriously the candle has been burning for 1 hour and I already know it‚Äôs  the best not only by the smell but by the way it burns. Can‚Äôt wait to burn our Expresso next!
4,6-Nov-19,5,"Perfect candle! I love this candle.  It burns beautifully, and the scent is very mild and pleasant.  Will definitely order again!"
4,1-Jun-20,5,"Amazing! I purchased the Fresh Linen candle and it smells SO good! My house smells amazing, and I love how the simplicity of the packaging makes it possible to work with any room decor. I can't wait to try more scents and give these as gifts to others!"
4,9-Apr-20,5,"smells so good! got this as a birthday gift for my friend who loves coffee and she loved the scent and says the candle burns really slow, which is good."
4,30-Nov-19,3,"It‚Äôs okay I don‚Äôt dislike or love the candle. It does smell like the scent I purchased, but the wax formula feels a bit cheap and ‚Äúwatery‚Äù. Not my first choice but it does the job."
4,21-Apr-20,4,"Can't go wrong Great candle, and smells great. Thought it was gonna be bigger for the price point, it's about the size of an 8oz water bottle but the smell can transcend a room. But it serves it purpose and burns slowly so I think I'll get some really good uses out of it."
4,20-Oct-20,5,GREAT I love this candle. The scent is great and if you love dogs like most humans then it‚Äôs furr a great cause. The smaller one would make for an ideal gift but I would honestly recommend the larger one for personal use and longevity. 9.5/10
4,5-Nov-20,5,I have ordered them four times for friends birthday and they have loved them! Very Giftable! A special gift for anyone special in your life!
4,23-Apr-20,5,It is a very pretty candle to display It smells just like I wanted.  Not super over powering the kitchen but just perfect.  I would buy it again and not a more expensive candle.  I bought a second one for a gift.
4,20-Jun-20,5,"Smells great! I light the candle whenever I want to calm myself down before going to bed. It creates a nice ambiance and on top, great scent all in my room. I would love to recommend the Wild Lemongrass if you want to create spa-like ambiance and calmness. Would love to buy it again."
4,14-Oct-20,5,Great candle! This is a very nice candle.  Great scent and high quality packaging and container.  Also great as a gift idea. I'll definitely be purchasing more candles from them!
4,9-Apr-19,5,SMELLS SO GOOD I listened to a review that recommended the Pineapple Evergreen scent (which sounds like such a strange combination) and I can't stop smelling it! It's not strong or overwhelming (some scents give me a headache) and it's unique. New favorite candle!
4,14-Feb-20,5,QUALITY CANDLE I love this candle! I already purchased a second one. The scent is great and it burns so clean. Makes a great gift!
4,24-Jun-20,5,The perfect scent for Fall!! Perfect cozy scent for Fall.  Reminds me of times spent with my Dad as a kid when he enjoyed the occasional pipe out on our porch on a cool Autumn day.  ‚ù§
4,24-Oct-20,4,"Jasmine, Oud & sandalwood A pretty candle but doesn‚Äôt smell AT all like le labo. If you are buying this as a dupe for santal 33 keep looking. I do like the look and appreciate that a hand poured candle for under $20 isn‚Äôt a bad deal. I will keep looking for a dupe for le labo."
4,29-Jun-19,5,Very strong and long lasting for the size and price I got the Cedarwood Infused Mango. The scent is strong but not overwhelming. The small size I got was enough for a room. I left it on about 3 hours a day and it lasted about two weeks.  I also purchased the fresh linen but haven't used it yet. Great value.
4,9-Jun-20,5,"Last a long time This candle last a very long time and the scent is very nice, not too strong.  The candle is smaller than I thought it would be - but it has lasted a long time.I will definitely order again."
4,13-Jun-20,1,OVER PRICED!!! Product is over priced compared to similar products from other vendors.  It's very small for the price and nothing to warrant its price.  Lulu Candles are a rip off.  performance of product also does not warrant the price.  Buyer beware!!!
4,5-Jun-20,5,"BEST CANDLES EVER At first, I was worried about the scents because they didn‚Äôt make sense to me description wise, but they smell AMAZING! So so cute, shipped super fast, and smells so good. I cannot wait to continue buying these and I‚Äôm ready for the whole collection of scents. SO GOOD!!!!"
4,11-Nov-19,5,"Second time buying, this time larger size Even with larger size, smell quality isn't sacrificed and still great burn and long lasting smell.  Will say that the shipping had issues due to candle melting b/c of heat wave but Lulu was super quick to get another order out.  Going to be using these folks for quite some time!"
4,27-Dec-19,5,"This is a wonderful candle! I don't like fruity or sweet candle scents, but prefer woodsy and spicy - and this black amber is perfect. And the jar itself is attractive, too! I love this in my home but I will also give this as a gift. Highly recommend."
4,13-Jul-20,4,"Very expensive for a small candle The fresh linen has a very nice, mellow scent. The description of the product is accurate. I love the labelling--it matches my bathroom perfectly.This is the most expensive and smallest candle I've ever bought."
4,17-Nov-19,5,"Long lasting candle, burns for hours. Burns for hours."
4,14-Feb-20,5,Love! Strong scent. Love it!
4,7-Jan-20,5,"Perfect Clean Scents I ordered both the Fresh Linen and Wild Lemongrass candles.  They both have amazingly clean, fresh scents. They are exactly as pictured and described.  This will likely be my go to candle company from now on with a nice line of scents to choose from."
4,6-Sep-20,5,"Love this scent! It's hard to find great candles on Amazon - and this is by far my favorite yet! Pineapple Evergreen is the best scent and it lasted for a while (something other candles don't always do!) I highly recommend Lulu Candles, they're great!"
4,17-Dec-19,5,These candles smell so good! Bought several different scents to use for Christmas gifts. They all smell so good! Bought one to keep for myself. Loving it after a few candle lightings! Definitely recommend these. I will  definitely  be buying more whenever I need gifts.
4,9-Jul-20,5,"Amazing candle and awesome scent! This scent was amazing! I saw great reviews for pineapple evergreen (a scent I never would have picked on my own) and I‚Äôm so glad I went with it! Such a wonderful combination, the perfect longevity and a great gift item! Would definitely buy this product again :)"
4,17-Jan-20,5,"Great candle I purchased the pineapple evergreen, which was less Evergreen than I wanted but a beautiful scent nonetheless.  It does not smell fake or overpowering.  I love soy candles because they burn clean and are long lasting."
4,13-May-20,5,Sexy Man LuLu Soy Candle I love everything about these LuLu candles!! Every candle I have purchased has smelled up my entire downstairs. My favorite is Sexy Man. Smells just like a sexy man's cologne.
4,23-Oct-20,1,"Smells nothing like the real thing I got this because it's on a bunch of lists as a Santal 26 dupe, and I gotta say...you get what you pay for. This smells like cheap odor freshener, and nothing like the real thing. If that's what you're looking for, don't bother getting this candle."
4,18-Oct-20,5,Great candle Smells amazing! Made a great gift.
4,9-Sep-20,5,Sweet Pleasant Smell I bought this as a kitchen candle- Lemon Vanilla Bean scent. It's so interesting and unique as a smell! I haven't had a candle smell like this yet. The candle is also small but burns slowly. I love it. I have a feeling I'll buy more.
4,27-Mar-20,5,Smells great and covers large area. This candle smells great and the scent fills quite a large space for being so small. I can smell it from the next room as I'm writing this! The visual aesthetic is very pleasing as well. We'll be purchasing more from this brand.
4,17-Apr-20,5,"Great value for the money I just got this candle today and I love it ! The scent is beautiful, not too strong or weak . Would make a great gift."
4,26-Jul-20,5,Smelled amazing Bought as a gift for a friend. Smelled wonderful.
4,8-Sep-20,5,Wonderful! This smells heavenly! Cant wait to try other scents!
4,30-Jul-19,1,Smells nice This candle is very  snall and expensive
4,23-May-20,5,Great Smell & Service Great Service & the product arrived a day early which was great. Smells exactly like fresh linen. Can‚Äôt wait to use it & see if last long. I‚Äôm excited since I use candles pretty often.
4,19-Feb-20,5,Worth it! Lulu‚Äôs Soy candles are the way to go if you want longevity in your candle. And they are great at freshening up your room whether lit or not. Definitely will be buying more!
4,5-May-20,5,Candle I got this as a gift and it is perfect. It is so cute and it says happy birthday on it! Perfect for someone who loves candles. It also smells great.
4,1-Nov-20,5,"nice candle for cozy fall day The Jasmine, Oud & Sandalwood Lulu candle adds warms my sunroom as the weather cools off. The scent is a nice jasmine and sandalwood. This would be a great gift for yourself - or a friend."
4,28-May-20,5,Smells so good! The smell is so good!! Fills up my entire bottom floor which other candles don‚Äôt usually do. Definitely will be getting more :)
4,27-May-20,5,Great smell! I love the smell and it seems to last awhile
4,13-Aug-20,5,"SEXY MAN SMELLS LIKE HEAVEN!!!!! SEXY MAN SMELLS LIKE HEAVEN!!!!! My favorite candle scent ever. Every time someone enters my bedroom, they comment on how amazing my room smells - even when the candle isn‚Äôt lit. Highly recommend as a gift or for anyone who makes an amazing smelling space!"
4,13-Jan-19,5,Great strong scent This candle is worth the money.  I am super picky about wanting candles with good strong scents that fill a room and these do the trick.  The pineapple evergreen scent is very nice and different.  Will definitely order more soon.
4,14-May-20,4,Smells great and pretty container. Great for gifting - excellent packaging. Smells great and looks pretty.  More reasonably priced than similar smelling candles.
4,2-Jul-20,5,"Wildly Delicious Lemongrass I wanted something simple, cute, and refreshing, and the lemongrass Lulu candle fulfilled all of my wishes. People rave about the other delicious scents and I might just have to purchase another. You can practically smell this candle before you even open the box."
4,29-Jan-20,5,"Smells Amazing! I bought this as a gift for my husband for our 16th wedding anniversary (the modern gift is wax, thought this was funny). I only bought it for the name ""Sexy Man"", but it is by far my favorite candle scent ever! It is a clean smell, fresh a hint masculine. Highly recommend!"
4,15-Jul-20,5,"I cannot recommend this candle enough! Awesome candle!  I got the coffee scent, it is literally to die for.  I wasn't even going to leave a review until i saw how long it looks like its going to last compared to the last one i got from another brand.  They have gained a customer out of me for sure!"
4,18-Oct-19,5,Great smell and burns long We love the look and aroma of this candle. Fills up the whole room and burns for very long!!
4,9-Apr-20,5,"Pineapple Evergreen smells amazing! The Pineapple Evergreen candle just screams clean. It‚Äôs a white candle that leaves the room smelling clean. You can definitely smell the pineapple, and it ying and yangs nicely with the earthy tang of the evergreen."
4,21-Jan-19,5,Such a great smell!!! The fresh linen candle seriously smells AMAZINGGGGG. Super fresh and clean sent...potent too! Will continue to buy these :)
4,3-Aug-20,4,"smells good I bought the pineapple evergreen scent because of the good review, and it smells so good. I put it on my night table and it makes my room smells amazing! The only thing is that it's a bit pricey for a small jar."
4,1-Feb-20,1,"Don't smell sandalwood at all To be honest, it smells like a very old person's home. I know scents are subjective but this one was not good at all. I was hoping for it to have a more sandalwood scent but it just didn't"
4,26-May-20,5,"Smells terrific, slow burning I ordered the pineapple evergreen candle and it smells great!  It is a small candle but very slow burning.  This candle looks like it will last a long time.  I will definitely order some of their other candles."
4,21-Apr-20,5,"Beautiful candle Candle is small but burns nicely. The scent is fresh and clean. A great alternative to typical candle scents. After one day of use, candle has barely burned down so appears to be long lasting."
4,1-Nov-20,5,"Sexy Man? Yes, please! I have ordered this candle on repeat.  You wouldn't know I have a stinky dog and the scent is super fresh and clean, just like you would expect a sexy man to be.  In addition, it lasts and lasts.  I highly recommend!"
4,25-May-20,5,"Great smell, no headache! I love the smell of this candle and it does not give me a headache like traditional candles do."
4,29-Jul-20,5,Pretty nice Smelled really good
4,14-Jun-19,5,"Lemongrass has a lovely smell. I love the smell of the lemongrass candle. I ordered it to put on the patio to repel insects, because I heard that it does that. I will let you know in due time if that works. In the meantime I'm enjoying the scent."
4,22-Jun-20,4,I'll Buy Them Again & Again This candle is simply amazing! The scents are strong and carries throughout the day even after you've blown out the candle. I love the look of the candle. I did gift them to expecting parents who also shared that they love the scents
4,15-May-20,5,Very nice scent This candle smells fabulous! Unexpected treat! Makes a great gift
4,3-Jul-20,5,"Strong scent The scent is strong, I worry with soy candles but this one is great. Will definitely be buying again."
4,28-Oct-20,1,Don't Buy No scent at all...just burns like any other candle. No idea why since the smaller one is more potent.
4,7-Dec-18,5,Smells incredible! Love the smell of this candle.  And I think they did a really cool job with the basic graphics.  Goes well with a modern/simple home decor theme that I love!
4,30-Apr-20,5,BEST SMELLING CANDLE EVER This candle is phenomenal. I have tried many of the scents from Lulu's and they are all delicious but this one might take the cake. The only downside is they burn a bit fast because I want to use them all the time! You won't regret this purchase.
4,29-Nov-19,5,Amazing aroma This candle smells amazing and fills the room with the scent. I love it.
4,19-Apr-20,5,"Smells great, burns slow Bought this as a gift for my boyfriend for his birthday. He loves the scent and it appears to be very slow burning. He also loves the look."
4,7-Nov-20,5,"wonderdul candle! such cute packaging and wonderful smell! I find that it doesn't take long for the candles smell to fill your room. If you do forget to leave it on, however, it should burn too much, I can tell this candle will last!"
4,7-Apr-19,5,My mothers favorite candle This was a gift and she loved it. She uses it when she cooks.
4,30-Dec-19,5,Nice candle I purchased the Fresh Linen and it is a very mello fresh clean smelling!  It is not over powering. I purchased the smaller 6oz jar to check these candles out. I will buy more. I plan to get a few as hostess gifts but for myself I will buy the larger jar. Very clean and long burn.
4,14-Mar-20,5,Prefect Smell! These are my favorite candles outside of Bath and Body Works. The scent is amazing and not overbearing. I ordered the Pineapple Evergreen scent and it smells like what you‚Äôd imagine a warm sunset in Hawaii to smell like. I will be buying again! My only wish is that they‚Äôd make way bigger sizes.
4,17-Aug-19,5,"Amazing candle. This is the only candle brand I use for my home now. I tried one out last year and this is the only brand I‚Äôve been buying. Even if you light it for just a bit, the smell surrounds the room. So far I‚Äôve bought pineapple evergreen and the coffee scented one and I‚Äôve loved both of them."
4,26-Jul-20,5,"Wonderful candle brand I own the Wild Lemongrass scent and it smells delightful. The smell permeates the whole room and is very potent. I love this candle brand, this is my 2nd candle from Lulu Candles, and I will certainly continue to buy more."
4,26-Apr-20,4,Amazing Scent and Throw I wasn't sure what to expect with this scent but I am pleasantly surprised! The best part about this candle is that the scent it throws when it burns is exactly what it smells like when you open the lid. I am definitely a fan and will be buying more!
4,16-Aug-19,5,"Great candle! This candle smells great. I bought it for my office, and one can smell it from the hallway. It smells really clean. I would definitely recommend this candle (Fresh Linen scent)"
4,13-Aug-20,5,AMAZING!! I‚Äôm a candle lover. I ordered the cedarwood infused mango... IT SMELLS SO GOOD! I‚Äôve been burning this candle for at least four hours and this candle is sincerely slow burning! I will be buying more candles!
4,27-Aug-20,1,"Glade candle, boutique label Such high hopes from reviews.Awful, unsophisticated, cheap smelling... this is essentially a Glade candle with a boutique label slapped on."
4,17-Oct-20,5,Smells Awesome Love this candle!  I could smell the scent starting to fill the room within a few minutes of lighting.  The scent isn‚Äôt overpowering at all and lingers long after the candle has been blown out.  I‚Äôll definitely be ordering more of these candles.
4,25-Jun-20,5,Good quality Nice candles.
4,8-Jun-20,5,Great candle Love it!! Smells great!!!!
4,28-Sep-20,5,Good candle. Good price. The candle provides a nice subtle background scent. It also burns slowly and lasts a long time. It‚Äôs nice if you like a light subtle scent in the room.  The candle is also reasonably priced compared to other candles of this size.
4,24-Jun-20,5,"Love my new candles! It smelled so good! I‚Äôve tried so many candles, and these were my favorite. I have yet to burn it but my room smells amazing just sitting there. The jar is stunning as well. I got two scents and am looking forward to getting more."
4,21-Dec-19,4,Very nice I ordered the wrong scent but was happy with it nun the less. Very nice.
4,6-May-20,5,"Great scent. Buy it! I love this candle. It has such a good combination of jasmine, oudh and Sandlewood. One of the best candles I have used. Highly recommend this scent."
4,21-Sep-20,5,A GREAT SCENT ! I love the scent of this candle.  I appreciate the fact that I can leave the candle unlit and the scent will still permeate the room
4,30-Apr-20,4,Great smelling candle Great smell. Just like warm blueberries just wish the wick let the candle burn a little longer. Would buy again because of the scent
4,20-Oct-20,5,This candle smells amazing! This is such a great fall/winter candle.  I came across this candle at a steak house I had dinner at and couldn't believe how great it smelled.  I'm so glad I was able to find it on Amazon.  I loved it so much I bought one for a friend as well!
4,4-Oct-20,5,"best candles ever really great quality of candles. the day i received the candle, i lit it and in less than 30 mins the whole apartment was filled with its scent."
4,25-Oct-18,5,"Pineapple-evergreen a great combination! I lit my pineapple-evergreen candle for the first time today.  I really like the scent that filled the room. The combination is wonderful. Not to strong.  I also like that it is a soy candle. I will be purchasing more. The price is right, and I received it in two days."
4,12-Mar-19,5,"Smells amazing!! The smell is amazing. I generally like very strong smelling candles this one wasn't as strong as I would've liked, but still great. I will buy more candles from this seller!"
4,11-Nov-20,5,Love! I was not expecting the smell of this candle to be so strong because of its size. The smell pay off is incredible and it never wears off. It‚Äôs packaging is so adorable and can work with any theme. Highly recommend these candles!
4,15-May-20,5,"Great gift I almost hate to burn it because it‚Äôs so cute! It smells so good, and it‚Äôs not overpowering like so many can be. I love it! Perfect gift for loved ones or a little treat to yourself ?üòâ"
4,8-Jun-20,5,"great scent and long lasting I loved these candles! I bought this and ""sexy man"" and they both smell great. They are a bit smaller than I expected, but they last a long time. They also make your whole room smell good in a matter of minutes. I would definitely purchase from this company again."
4,10-Jul-20,4,"Aromatic Cute little candle, but burns slow for long use. The smell is nice to me, but my boyfriend absolutely loves it!! Really makes the whole house smell good. I can even smell it when it‚Äôs not burning."
4,26-May-20,5,So happy! I bought this candle as a present and it's such a perfect gift! The scent is not too overpowering. It's a light clean scent! Very happy with my purchase and can't wait to try the other scents.
4,3-Sep-20,5,"Smells Unreal I ordered this candle because O Magazine rated it one of the best. Let me tell you!!! This candle will make you feel like you are in a high end spa, or shopping in a swanky store while the sales people are refilling your champagne glass."
4,17-Jun-19,5,Looks nice & smells great! I love the scent and the candle looks very nice.  Very happy with my purchase
4,27-Sep-20,5,"I‚Äôm loving it! It burns slow as stated and gives off a subtle but sweet lemongrass scent. It is a bit small but burns very slow and hand poured soy candles are pricier keep in mind, think quality over quantity. Also perfect for me as a candle to travel with."
4,29-Aug-19,5,Smells so good. Smells really good. Last a long time!
4,30-Jan-20,5,"Worth your money I bought the Passion Fruit Infused Mango and it's amazing. The scent is really good and is well balanced not too strong nor too weak. This candle is worth the money, I highly recommend it. I will be buying different scents to try them."
4,20-Jul-20,4,"Good candle options, depending on scent Ordered two candles, the Jasmine and Linen candle, which came quickly. They do burn slowly which is nice, but the Linen candle came without a label on it which was disappointing. Will be purchasing the Jasmine one again, but not the Linen one."
4,15-Oct-20,5,Strong Coffee Smell I just got my second espresso bean candle. I love that it is a soy candle and it is aesthetically pleasing. The candle lasts for a good while and the smell is strong and potent. Smells exactly like a coffee shop.
4,21-Oct-20,2,"No scent Though folks say the candle gives off its scent while burning, it does not, at all--at least in the Tuscan Tangerine candle.  So disappointing!"
4,27-May-19,5,"So far, so good! Although I've only had the product for a few days, it's been great so far! The smell is really fresh and clean, and is strong enough to smell throughout several rooms without being overpowering. It seems to burn pretty slowly, which is nice, as it makes me think it will last for a pretty long time. Overall it was a worthwhile purchase!"
4,29-Aug-20,5,"Long Lasting, Wonderful Scent I was looking for Coffee/Espresso candles and found a lot of positive reviews for Lulu Candles. They do not disappoint, I've ordered 2 more Espresso candles after being so happy with the first one!"
4,23-Oct-19,1,Smell is bad The smell is ugly not jasmine at all ÿåother thing its too expensive for this tiny jar.
4,12-Dec-19,4,Candle Smells good great price
4,26-Apr-20,5,"Great scent This candle let‚Äôs off a great scent and is long lasting. Great product, will likely buy again from Lulu Candles."
4,2-Apr-20,5,Best Smelling Candle I've Ever Purchased I was always searching for a candle that has a consistent smell and was slow burning. The 6 oz. candle's aroma packed a heavy punch and filled up to whole room with its amazing scent. I will definitely purchase more candles from Lulu again. Great Buy!
4,20-Oct-20,5,Love it! Came fast. Long life. Smells great.
4,31-Aug-20,4,Good scent - a bit sweet The scent is great! A good balance of earthy and floral. But it is a bit too sweet for my taste. Overall it's pretty good and the longevity and strength of the candle is really nice!
4,23-Nov-18,5,"Healthy, Scentual Candle Smells amazing, doesn‚Äôt irritate my breathing like some candles do. Great Christmas scent!"
4,23-Dec-19,5,"Simply Delicious! LULU Candles make a great product! Environmental and made in the USA. We just received our Wild Lemongrass scented candle and love it. The scent is great for any room in the house. My wife loves her baths, so this one is gonna live in the bathroom."
4,19-Mar-20,2,After 2 uses I can no longer use this!! Not worth it. The smell was amazing but this candle maybe burned 1/4 of the way and won‚Äôt stay lit. Waste of my money. Won‚Äôt be purchasing another expensive candle just for it to be thrown away.
4,18-Aug-20,1,Nope Really bad! Smells awful! Guaranteed headache!
4,9-Jun-20,5,Amazing Scent I purchased Midnight In Paris which smells amazing! Such a great candle and looks very nice. I will definitely purchase this candle again when this one runs out!
4,13-May-20,5,"Everything is amazing! These candles smell great and when I have interacted with the company, they were very nice and replied in a timely manner. I would very much recommend buying from them!"
4,19-May-20,5,"Smells Amazing! I just lit this candle and it smells great! I don't love sweet scents and this is a nice balance between fruity and neutral.If you Like coffee shop smells, the Espresso Bean has a nice vanilla/espresso smell that I love!"
4,19-Nov-20,5,"LOVE LOVE LOVE I love these candles. They smell beautiful and look beautiful in my house (clean-looking, modern). Even burn and no black smoke. This is my second time ordering, and I will definitely be repurchasing as soon as these burn out."
4,9-Jan-20,5,"Love this candle I absolutely love this candle. I got the tobacco spice & vanilla scent... To be honest, I was unsure how I‚Äôd like the scent but it‚Äôs absolutely perfect.. I will definitely have to get it in a bigger size!"
4,19-Oct-20,5,Great purchase! I have not even lit the candle yet but can already smell it just from setting it out. Aesthetically appeasing as well!
4,25-May-20,5,Great gift I bought this as a gift and seriously debated keeping for myself. It smelled so amazing! My friend asked where I got it and that she was going to order one as well!
4,8-Apr-20,5,Smells Amazing! This candle is amazing! Been ordering these for a while now and finally got one for my bed room! recently did some renovations and the smell of the candle really makes the place feel like home! Would definitely recommend this candle!
4,6-Jun-20,5,"We Love it!! Highly recommended I highly recommend this product.With only one candle lit, it makes my whole living room, hallway, bathroom and kitchen smell great!"
4,21-May-20,2,"Fragrance not very strong and definitely not lemongrass Gifted to friend who loves everything lemongrass and when she popped the top to smell, her expression and comment was, 'hmmm'.  I know it's risky to buy scent online and this one did not work out.  Bummer."
4,18-Nov-20,5,"Solid product, as expected I honestly am not nuts about the scent of this candle (Mary Jane) but the packaging, design, longevity, and quality are solid! I ordered another Lulu candle just to see if I like that scent better, I just think maybe Mary Jane wasn't for me."
4,8-Nov-20,5,"Smells just like a bookstore! My absolute favorite candle!! The espresso bean scent is so nice, it makes my whole apartment smell just like Barnes & Noble. I loved this scent so much that this was a repeat purchase for me, and I will continue buying them after I run out!"
4,12-Jul-20,5,Awesome! Very satisfied with the product! Incredible long lasting smell. I will certainly be purchasing it again.
4,30-Dec-19,5,Love the scent! I absolutely love this candle. The scent isn't overpowering and it's very refreshing. It's exactly the scent I was looking for. I find myself liting it every day. Although I haven't had it very long yet I can tell it's longlasting. I'm definitely going to order more candles!
4,9-Apr-20,5,Smells so good! The fresh linen scent smells like laundry. I lit it for about two hours and it barely melted! Great product and looks really sleek. It is smaller than other similarly priced candles but the quality is definitely better.
4,9-Jun-20,5,Smells amazing I absolutely love this candle scent!  I love the glass jar and label.  It looks very classy.  It would make a wonderful gift!
4,9-Apr-20,5,"Smells AMAZING!!!!!!!! Perfect gift!!! The smell is incredibly amazing. I truly cannot believe how good this smells. This is such a perfect gift to give to your coworkers or any coffee lover, literally smells like you have a yummy cappuccino waiting for you. I will order another one just to maximize the smell haha."
4,25-Dec-18,5,Light and natural lemon scent A wonderful but not overpowering.  Totally natural scent no chemical smell.  Soothing.
4,20-Mar-20,1,"Expensive yet poor quality. Fast-burning wick. Wouldn‚Äôt evenly melt and hardly burned. Scooped lots of the wax out hoping it was just overfill, but truly sub-par wick for the price. Not worth it."
4,30-Aug-20,1,Waste of money This candle barely has any scent at all.  I bought it because it had so many positive ratings and comments about being a good value.  I‚Äôd rather spend more and have a candle that actually smells.
4,30-Jul-20,5,Amazing!! Beautiful packaging and great great scent. I will purchase for gifts this holiday.  This is my new go to candles. Obsessed!!!!
4,6-Nov-19,5,Love it Fun gift
4,17-Apr-20,5,"Fresh Linen is as advertised! Great quality and weight for the price, feels like a $40+ candle and smells exactly like fresh laundry, but without too strong of a detergent scent. Highly recommend and the cap doubles as a stand for the bottom as well"
4,10-Sep-19,1,Does not last very long. The smell was good but the candle burned out way too quickly.
4,28-Mar-19,5,Amazing This candle might be my favorite out there. This candle packs a huge punch despite it being so cheap and small compared to other candles out there. The 6 oz candle lasted me a long time and easily filled my bedroom.
4,20-Feb-20,4,"Beautiful and simple It's a beautiful and simple candle. Rather than bitter coffee, it smells more like a sweet coffee shop. I like the smell of it very much. I also got the sexy man one, it smells great as well. Sometimes doesn't burn all the way but I'm not too bothered by that."
4,25-Mar-20,4,Smells great Smells great and the white glass is sleek.
4,9-Oct-20,5,"Smells like Heaven This smells like heaven. I‚Äôve been looking for a tobacco & vanilla candle for years, ever since I smelled one in a store once. Arrived perfectly fine too"
4,11-Apr-20,3,Not worth the price Smells good but is over priced for the size burn of 5 hours and half of the candle is already gone. A candle of this size and burning hours should be priced around 8-9 dollars at the most.
4,29-Oct-20,1,"Melts Horribly - Do Not Buy The smell is amazing, however the candle doesn‚Äôt melt evenly at all. It was left burning for hours and still managed to only melt a small circle around the wick. It now can‚Äôt be lit without putting itself out."
4,5-Jul-19,5,"No. 14 Jasmine, Oud & Sandalwood Smells Amazing I got the Jasmine Oud & Sandalwood scent. The first thing I noticed is the pleasant sandalwood scent. Very clean, and not too strong like some other brands, it burns low and slow and puts off just enough scent for the living room in the apartment. It was well packaged and arrived in perfect condition! Will buy again for myself or as a gift!"
4,3-Apr-20,5,Smells great! The candle smells great! I just received it so I don't know about burn time yet But it looks pretty and smells good! So far the only downside is that I was expecting it to be a bit larger.
4,2-Jan-19,5,"Smells Great.  Last long. Even Better Price. So far I like everything about this candle.  I bought the Fresh Linen scent for a friend for Christmas, but loved it so much that I kept it for myself!  So far, it has outlasted our other candles this size and is still going strong.  The candle is totally worth it for the price too.  It was a great buy all the way around, and I look forward to trying out the other scents!"
4,3-Jun-20,5,"Candle but perfect There's nothing I do not love about these candles.  Long lasting, perfect size and amazing fragrance options all for a reasonable price."
4,19-Dec-19,5,"Smells incredibly fresh This candle smells amazing and is not overpowering at all. A fresh, clean scent and I will absolutely buy this again. I actually bought it as a gift but when I opened and smelled it, I had to keep it for myself!"
4,21-Apr-20,5,"Smells great! Bought this as a gift, smells so good. Cute and small candle, love it"
4,5-Nov-20,3,Meh Meh
4,15-Feb-20,5,The scent is delicious. I have always loved candles but not the residue their leave on the ceiling.  This is my first soy candle and so far I'm very impressed.
4,18-May-20,5,Small but effective The candle is rather small as everyone said but the scent is really powerful. It‚Äôs cute and has a nice modern feel to it fit for a simplistic look. I love this candle and I want to buy several more. The fresh linen is my personal favorite!
4,28-Sep-20,5,Not your typical Oud I was really hoping to get more oud for my middle eastern clients but this isn't bad at all. It's soft and earthy. I would definitely re-purchase it but not with OUD in my mind. packaging wasn't giftable worthy but it was wrapped properly.
4,13-Apr-20,5,"Fantastic, non-overbearing smell. This candle is a great choice for men who like a fresh, masculine smell in their room that is not too overbearing. It's also at a pretty solid price for a candle, not bad at all. But the smell is honestly great and something I never get sick of."
4,1-Nov-19,5,"Hours of nasal pleasure all wrapped up into wax! Such a wonderful hug of scents!  I wouldn't have thunk Oud (Had to Google) and Sandalwood would pair and holy missoula, not only did the smell enhance every room, it LINGERED for hours!Compliments galore!  You'll literally walk taller with this candle!  Get yourself one.  Truly.  You're welcome."
4,7-May-19,1,"Waste of money , no scent Didn‚Äôt like it, no scent at all. Wanted to give a shot at this candle but was disappointed. I will stick to my Walmart scented candles."
4,9-Nov-20,5,"Love the aroma! Smells wonderful, so much so that I haven‚Äôt burned it yet!"
4,15-Aug-20,5,Smells great!! I can‚Äôt drink coffee due to stomach issues. So I bought this candle to smell that scent that I missed so much. And I love it!!!
4,6-May-19,5,Great smell - Fresh linen These candles are amazing! I read some of the reviews and bought the 6oz of fresh linen. The smell was pleasant. It appears to be long lasting as the description states. I've lit it for a couple of hours and the wax has only gone down a little bit. I will definitely be buying the other scents once these burn out. Would highly recommend.
4,29-Jan-20,5,Smell so good Best smelling candles EVER
4,5-Nov-19,4,These candles are great and affordable! This is my second time to order the linen scent of this candle and I have really enjoyed them. It‚Äôs a good price for a candle that fills a room effectively with a lovely and not overpowering scent.
4,23-Aug-20,5,Best candle I‚Äôve ever had! I am so happy I decided to get this candle. It is kinda small but I‚Äôm not mad at all it‚Äôs everything I was looking for in a candle - and more. Will definatly be buying more in different scents!
4,26-Jul-19,5,Love it! The scent lasts a long time even after you blow out the candle.
4,14-Jul-20,5,"The smell is AMAZINGGGG! I love this product so much, you can smell the scent even while the candle is off. I always have two extra ones for back up! The glass jar with the black label is nice and sleek as well, goes with perfect with my decor!"
4,24-Feb-20,5,Love the scent! Love this candle.  Best smelling candle.  Bought this for my husband since it is more masculine scented but I love it so much I ordered another.  It is almost instant smell when you start to burn it.
4,7-Aug-20,5,"Perfect Gift! The scent of this candle is AMAZING, and it has become my go-to gift in recent months! I think I've given this candle as a gift to almost 10 people at this point, in addition to keeping one for myself!"
4,20-Jun-19,5,"Overall great candle This smells great, burns slowly, and looks cute."
4,5-Sep-20,5,Perfect Candle and Smells Amazing Great candle! It has a wonderful rich scent and is the perfect size! You can just leave the candle out (without burning it) and the whole room smells amazing! I will definitely be buying more!
4,27-Aug-19,5,"Cute, Smaller Than Anticipated Cute jar, fresh scent, and not too overwhelming. Only wish it was a bit larger and listed the ingredients."
4,6-Jan-20,5,My new favorite candles I've been looking for a new brand of candles and discovered Lulu around the holidays. I'm hooked‚Äîthe scents are delicate and unique and the packaging is beautiful. I will be gifting these to everyone in 2020.
4,19-Jan-20,4,"Great Scent I got the Espresso Bean candle, and it smells great. It's strong enough that you can even smell it when the candle is unlit with the lid on. I gave only 4 stars because I can't yet speak to how long the candle will burn. If you like the smell of brewing coffee, this scent is perfect."
4,23-Mar-20,5,"Smells amazing! This candle is great for a few reasons. The smells are always spot on to their names. The ""fresh linen"" one just makes your house smell like fresh laundry - it's amazing. I also like the jar & have always liked this brand of candles."
4,25-Jan-20,5,"Lovely Candle! I was a little worried buying the lemon & vanilla bean scented candle because I only like a very particular type of vanilla smell. But, this candle has a light and very pleasing scent to it, not at all overly sugary. Would definitely buy another from this company!"
4,4-Oct-20,5,"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE! WITHIN 5 MINUTES OF LIGHTING, THIS CANDLE FILLED AN ENTIRE 2 BEDROOM HOUSE WITH ITS WONDERFUL SCENT! NO YANKEE CANDLE STANDS A CHANCE COMPETING WITH THAT! DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON OTHER JARS OF WAX. THIS IS LEGITIMATELY WORTH YOUR MONEY!"
4,11-Jun-20,4,"Nice candle, strong scent This candle is a perfect size if you're looking for something small but powerful (approx 3 in high). I got the Wild Lemongrass - the scent is much stronger than I expected and more lemon than lemongrass in my opinion so I'd recommend this for a larger room."
4,1-Jun-20,5,"GREAT for a quick gift I am thrilled with the birthday candles, the look great, smell great, and provide a wonderful quick birthday gift for anyone!  I have a couple tucked away for those days I may forget someone, I have a beautiful gift ready to go."
4,16-Jul-20,5,Great scent and will purchase more. This is my second candle purchase from Lulu Candles. They are the real guys. I tried a different scent this time around (tobacco/vanilla) and it smells so good and smooth. I‚Äôll be back for more.
4,22-Sep-19,5,"Definitely smells like a sexy man! Why I purchased a candle in the scent ‚Äúsexy man‚Äù I don‚Äôt know...but let me tell you, the smell is definitely accurate! I can‚Äôt speak on the longevity yet because I‚Äôve only burned it a couple times but so far so good. Especially for the price. Would definitely buy again. Very interested in trying other scents as well!"
4,16-Jan-20,5,"Smell lasts a long time and is a perfect blend of amber and rose I love these candles. The scent is strong, but not overwhelming. I've tried both the Pineapple and Evergreen (which is an interesting combo) and the Amber Rose & Musk candle. This scent feels nice and close to my personality."
4,18-Dec-19,5,"I ain‚Äôt never smelled a man THIS sexy!!!!! Ordered this candle for my brother for Christmas and upon opening and smelling it, I decided to keep it for myself. It smells SO good and so far seems to burn pretty slow. Maybe I‚Äôll order another one to give to him for his birthday? Maybe it‚Äôll never reach him? We‚Äôll see!"
4,15-Jun-20,4,Smaller than expected; smells really good Just received this product few days ago so cannot comment on longevity. The candle somehow was missing the front label (disappointed about this so took one star off). The fresh linen smell is really good. Would buy again in the bigger size!
4,29-Jun-19,5,Relaxing scent Love the scent and it burns evenly
4,15-May-20,5,Awesome scent Love the scent! One of my faves. Definitely keeping it around
4,25-Nov-19,5,"Great product! Just a great overall candle. Smell is fresh but not overbearing, appearance is sleek and minimal, and you can't beat the price! Will definitely replenish when this one runs low."
4,16-Oct-20,4,"Doesn‚Äôt smell like Cannabis I ordered the ‚ÄúMary Jane‚Äù cannabis infused scent. While it did smell good, it barely smelled like Mary Jane. It has more of a lemon scent. That said, it burns well and is still a nice candle."
4,19-Feb-19,5,Smells delicious This is my third candle from LuLu. I absolutely love the scent of this candle. It‚Äôs warm and comforting. It‚Äôs perfect to relax to and watch tv after a long day. I love the packaging and already have recommended to friends as well as gifted a few.
4,29-Dec-19,5,"Smells amazing!!! Bought this as a gift for a co-worker. Since I didn't buy it for myself I can't tell you whether or not it actually burns slowly, however it sure smells heavenly!"
4,6-Mar-20,5,Scent big enough to fill my loft A friend gave me the first one of these that I had.  I now buy them regularly.  I live in a loft with 13-foot ceilings and other candles that I've tried just don't disperse their aromas through the place like these do.  And it is a very pleasant aroma.
4,27-May-20,4,"Fresh, Clean Scent I love the smell of this candle and the outer glass is a subtle decoration.  I wish it lasted longer, but I also burn it quite frequently.  For the price and quality, I would recommend."
4,9-Jun-20,5,It‚Äôs a very fresh smelling candle This candle smells good and the moment I opened the envelope I was pleased.  It burns clean and even and has a nice and soft yet noticeable lemon scent. I would definitely buy again!
4,11-Feb-20,5,The scent is wonderful This candle smells so good. My husband loves it. He never comments on the candles.  I love it.
4,18-Dec-19,5,Looking for perfect tobacco candle...This is it Gorgeous rich fragrance
4,22-Feb-20,5,Great sent! Travels far. Long burn time. This candle smells amazing! I wanted something smaller for the bathroom when guests are over so I got the 6oz size and it‚Äôs perfect! And the sent goes a long way. I could smell it when I walked through my front door. Definitely will be trying other sents!
4,13-Jul-20,5,Great smell - great look - a tad pricy The candle arrived quickly and had minimal packaging which is great! The smell is awesome (Black Amber). I will def buy from them again. I wish this size candle was more in the $10 range... but besides that it's awesome.
4,13-Feb-20,5,Love it/ would absolutely buy again Saw/smelled the espresso bean candle a few days ago and HAD to have it! The package was delivered a few hours ago and you best believe I‚Äôm already burning it. Can‚Äôt wait to try other scents
4,22-May-20,5,Excellent scent This candle came exactly as described and in a very timely manner. I definitely recommend these candles
4,20-Aug-19,5,"Lovely smells Love the candles! I got both the Jasmine, sweet pea and apple and the Blueberry Cobbler - both smelled so good straight out of the box and I can actually smell them all the way up to our second floor."
4,16-Sep-20,4,Smells great but the fragrance strength can‚Äôt be smelled when lit even close by The candle is a good size and smells really good but the scent throw off isn‚Äôt good. I have it about 2 feet from where I sit and can‚Äôt smell the fragrance at all.
4,12-Sep-20,5,Amazing!! Smells great so happy! OMG I LOVE these!  They make my room smell amazing ever before I lit it!!!  This is one of my favorite combinations!  Will be purchasing many more!! (And I have!)
4,21-Jun-20,4,Spa Scents Very solid materials. Not cheap at all. The Moroccan Lily scent is more for a spa than a bedroom in my opinion. But definitely has a long burn time.
4,20-Jun-19,5,"You won‚Äôt be dissspointed Nice packaging, gave as a gift and the recipient really liked it"
4,8-Jun-20,5,"Non-toxic scent! I was looking for a candle for my wife that would not omit toxic fumes.  Regular candles make me sick to the stomach from the toxic omissions.  This candle was pleasant and smooth, and non-toxic."
4,3-Jul-19,5,Super Cute Fragrant Candle! This candle is everything I hoped it would be. I love the smell of lemongrass and this candle embodies it perfectly! The candle is itself is also very cute and modern looking.
4,30-Jul-20,5,"Smells amazing... Jury is still out on the longevity but up to this point has seemed adequate.  I liked the size, as it wasn't bulky or didn't feel like a big paper weight.  Burns even and the wick doesn't need to be dug out of the wax like some others I've used."
4,5-Aug-19,5,Great masculine scent with slight sweetness of vanilla Great candle. Love it so far.
4,10-Jun-20,5,"Cute candle and great scent. Love it! Not as vanilla-scented as I expected, but still a really great scent. Deep and smooth. Cute packaging as well; adds to my room decor."
4,1-Apr-20,5,Best Candle One of the best candles I‚Äôve had in awhile. This candle was a gift from a friend a few months ago and I had to get one of my own. The smell goes through the entire house.
4,11-May-20,5,"Best blueberry candle This is my new favorite scent! Although the candle was smaller than expected, it‚Äôs well worth it. The aroma of blueberry cobbler permeates my house. It‚Äôs a keeper!"
4,24-Jun-20,5,"Luscious Fragrance I ordered the Amber, Rose and Musk candle in 9 oz size.  I had it flaming for about 2 hours and it smelled awesome.  The scent really carries well.  No soot and the longevity is good as well."
4,22-Oct-20,5,"Not too strong, not too light, just right I just received my ""fresh linen"" candle and I'm obsessed. It's a refreshing scent that's perfect for my meditation and reading time. Makes me happy."
4,15-Jul-20,5,Worth the purchase Candle scent can be a little overpowering but it lasts a long time and leaves a pleasant smell after.
4,13-Feb-20,5,Wild Lemongrass!!! I walked into a retail store and was really struck by the candle they were burning. I decided to ask and proceeded to not only show me the candle but told my how long it lasts. I had to get it for myself and I love it! I will be ordering it again for sure!
4,18-Jul-20,5,"Definitely a buy I absolutely love Lulu candles. The lemongrass is potent and sweet enough that it‚Äôs really nice when it fills the whole room. I light it when I work, I feel energized with it."
4,14-Jun-19,5,Good smelling short burning Awesome scent didn‚Äôt burn Long  Longevity was SHORT
4,30-Jul-20,5,"Love the scent I was nervous about ordering a candle without smelling it first but this candle scent is amazing.  Not too strong, refreshing scent."
4,17-Nov-19,1,So small Wow so small.. and it does not smell
4,12-Sep-20,5,Good quality! Loved the sophisticated scent!  It‚Äôs slow burning and leaves the wax evenly distributed in the glass container.
4,25-Apr-20,5,Nice Soy Candle This sweet candle arrived nicely packaged and would make a great gift. The Amber Rose & Sheer Musk is a pleasant scent and not fruity or sweet smelling. It burns evenly and clean.
4,14-Aug-19,5,Yum It pairs well with pizza
4,11-Aug-20,5,"Love this scent - would buy again This candle smells soooo good. Definitely like a sexy man cologne but not too strong. In conjunction with sing-crying along to Taylor Swift‚Äôs love songs, this scent makes me feel like I actually have a boyfriend"
4,13-May-20,5,Smaller than I thought but cute! Smells so good! The packaging is really cute and the scent is strong. I likely won‚Äôt be burning it much as it‚Äôs for a bathroom shelf but it will look really cute! Smaller than I expected but I was pleasantly surprised.
4,6-Jan-20,1,Not good quality Disappointed on the size and price. The candle wax goes quick and doesn‚Äôt have a presence in fragrance smell. I am better off sticking with TJ Max candles for quality and price.
4,7-May-20,5,Amazing Candle! Just got this candle today and let me tell you !! It smell so good that i cant get enough! I just wish they made a bigger size of this :(. besides that i would definitely buy another one !
4,27-Jul-20,5,"The Lemon lights the air I have had so many candles not do what they say. Lulu Wild Lemongrass actualy fills my room with the freshness and tang of real lemongrass. Perfect ofr summer, perfect for my little altar area, corner of good vibes. Thanks Lulu."
4,28-May-20,4,"Fresh yet powdery I‚Äôm really liking this candle! It has a lovely, fresh, soft powdery scent that fills the room. Even walking past it while not lit, you will get a waft of the aroma. Totally worth it!"
4,3-Apr-20,5,"Long lasting candle Great candle!!! I wanted a long lasting candle and that exactly what I got!!! To be totally honest, I wish the sent would be more potent but maybe it was the sent that I got. Only one way to find out and order more!"
4,4-Nov-20,5,"good candle it is a good candle. it smells good (i got the lemongrass scent), it's lasted for a while, and it looks really cute sat on my desk. i enjoy this candle. also, i appreciate that it uses soy wax because it's better for the environment."
4,9-Apr-20,5,Black Amber lasts long! Love the Black Amber scent. It's subtle but fills a whole room naturally - not a note of fake chemicals.I let it burn for about 5 hours and it it barely melted down - I feel like it will last a long time.
4,6-Jun-20,5,Love it! Makes the whole house smell good!
4,12-Oct-20,5,Great candle! This is the second purchase of these candles I have made.  They have a strong scent and burn for a long time.  I was specifically looking for cotton wicks and that is why I purchased this to begin with.
4,21-Mar-20,5,Amazing purchase Absolutely love this little candle got it this week as a way to lift our spirits and have a little something fun in the bedroom while we are all having to stay put inside. Makes our small room smell so nice. And you can definitely smell the lemon!
4,4-Aug-20,2,"can't smell anything Elegant look, but smells nothing like jasmine."
4,20-May-20,5,"Buy this candle! We bought the 1.5oz candle to try out the scent before buying something larger. Not only is the scent amazing but these candles burn longer than candles 3x their size!Tabacco spice & vanilla, midnight in Paris, and black amber are our favorites."
4,13-Jul-19,5,Smells like real blueberry muffins baking! The blueberry smells so good! Its a creamy blueberry and fills the whole room.
4,15-May-20,5,Coffee Lover Love the way this smells! And you could still smell it even when it's not lit.
4,10-Oct-19,5,Fresh Linen Soy candle works great with asthma! I ordered the Fresh Linen scent soy candle for myself. I have asthma and can only burn soy or something comparable. I love the fresh linen scent! It‚Äôs so refreshing and clean smelling!
4,11-May-20,5,"Subtle, relaxing scent -- one of the best candles I've ever had! This Wild Lemongrass scent is subtle and helps me relax -- especially during anxiety produced when working from home during the CV-19 pandemic. Would recommend it for anyone who loves to enhance their environment with lovely scents."
4,27-Jun-19,5,Good product Good candle. The glass was shattered when it arrived but I chipped it away and placed it in a pot and am heating it on the stove.
4,27-Jul-19,4,Smells Amazing! The tobacco & vanilla candle smells incredible and even has an aroma when the lid is off and it is not lit. Great packaging and would definitely purchase again.
4,1-Sep-20,2,Disappointed! Opened the box to find a melted mess. The candle does smell great!! Ordered this candle because of the happy birthday box but now I have no gift. The replacement will arrive the day after the birthday.
4,4-Oct-20,5,Totally worth every penny This is the most amazing smelling candle ever!  The coffee smell fills your home instantly.  It is long lasting and all natural.  I would recommend this candle to everyone.
4,23-Jul-20,5,"When your pre-teen son loves it... The scent of this candle is  a m a z i n g. It's true, I love candles, just because, but when my pre-teen son came into the room and said ""that smells nice!"" ... well, I knew this one was a winner!"
4,13-Jun-20,5,So sleek. Beautiful soft scent.
4,31-Mar-20,5,Truly slow burning First time buying it and will definitely purchase again. It is truly slow burning and the smell is great. Can‚Äôt wait to try different scents.
4,5-Mar-20,5,I loved it... This fragrance is smooth and burns slowly. Next time I will buy a big one.
4,30-Apr-20,5,A great gift! Perfect gift for someone who appreciates a great quality candle! Worth the price!
4,16-Sep-20,5,"This candle smells amazing I am a poor college student living in a house of questionable smells, but when I light this bad boy up at my desk every night, all of it fades away and I am taken back to all of the bougie moments of my life. Would highly recommend"
4,23-Apr-20,4,"Great little candle! This candle smells amazing and is great for a desktop or small area. I keep this guy on my desk and the lemongrass is a wonderful scent to have around the room. I would highly recommend, I just wish the candle was bigger!"
4,20-Mar-20,5,Great scent. Clean burning. Love the scent. You can still smell the fragrance a day after burning.
4,17-Jul-20,5,Great Scent! I purchased the pineapple evergreen candle and my whole family loves it!  What may seem like an unusual scent combination is actually really nice together.  You won't be disappointed.
4,3-Mar-20,5,"Geat scent Really great scent and seems to last a long time sofar.  Wasn't sure I'd like Pineapple Evergreen initially, but it's pretty fantastic."
4,24-Sep-20,5,Rose This candle has A very pleasing fragrance. We could smell it throughout the entire first floor of the house.
4,8-Sep-20,5,"You need this candle! Love the smell of this candle, and how slowly it burns! Great value for price!"
4,9-Jun-20,3,Not for large spaces Although I did enjoy the smell it didn‚Äôt carry well in a larger space. And it didn‚Äôt last long.
4,25-Apr-20,1,Porta-scent I‚Äôm a little disappointed that this scent (lemongrass) smells like lemon-ass. It definitely has a porta-potty scent instead.I wouldn‚Äôt purchase again.Hope this review is helpful.
4,6-Sep-20,3,"Small for the price It's a nice candle, but I'm not sure why it is $20. It is a lot smaller than I expected. If I saw it in a store, I would assume the price was $8-$10 due to the small size."
4,24-Oct-20,5,Good candle I bought this for my daughter as a gift and she loves it. It smells very nice and it's for a good cause.  I can smell it from her room in the living room and it's a very pleasant smell.
4,14-Nov-19,5,"Pineapple Evergreen..just but it. This is one of those, ‚Äúbig things come in small packages‚Äù situations! Don‚Äôt let the size of this candle fool you...burns strong and fills the space with a heavenly Smell. I was hesitant about the pineapple/evergreen combo, but it‚Äôs amazing! I‚Äôve ordered candles from amazon before and this is the best I‚Äôve found."
4,5-Oct-20,5,Pineapple Evergreen Scent It‚Äôs the weirdest sounding scent but it‚Äôs awesome. Clean and fresh. Not too overpowering. This is my go to kitchen candle. Makes the whole house smell clean.
4,30-Nov-19,5,"Great scent Great scent! I was looking for something nice and natural, not too overwhelming. Lemon & Vanilla is a nice clean and mildly sweet scent. The candle also has a nice clean burn. Not sure about how long it will last yet. But very happy so far!"
4,2-Jan-20,5,Nice Scent Has a fresh smell! Very cute looking.
4,18-May-19,5,Great Scent and Price I have now bought four or five of these candles and love them! Every scent has been great but Lemon Vanilla and Wild Lemongrass have been my favorites. I burn them at my office and it makes our entire building smell great. Plus for the price point I think they are a bargain. Definitely will continue buying.
4,12-Apr-20,1,Did not burn evenly. Had to return the candle - it did not burn even.
4,22-Oct-19,4,"The scent seemed overpowering until I actually burned it. I wanted a a candle with a clean scent that was not overly floral.  This candle fit the bill.  When I first opened it, the scent seemed really strong, but once I started burning it, it was much more subtle.  It definitely does smell like fresh linen."
4,8-Dec-19,5,"pretty and nice!! the packaging is so pretty and cute. i ordered fresh linen & jasmine and lily. they both smells really great and it isn't a sharp smell, rather a soft smell that makes you feel really cozy. i recommend 10/10."
4,5-Jan-19,5,Smells great I really love the smell! So far it appears it will be long-lasting.
4,16-May-20,5,Smells Incredible Love the Lulu brand. Fragrances are incredible and burn time is great. You will not be disappointed.
4,11-Oct-20,5,A great candle! Love the lavender musk scent! Smaller than I expected (I know it gives oz but I don‚Äôt know how to gage that haha) but easily filled my living room in a one bedroom apartment! Will definitely buy many more of these.
4,2-May-20,5,"Wonderful Scent! I wanted a clean burning ""kitchen scent"" to burn in my kitchen. This wild lemongrass candle fit the bill. It smells great. I don't know the longevity, as I just received it last week. I will buy more in the future!"
4,25-Apr-20,5,"Wow! I absolutely love my candle - will reorder when needed. Soft burn, steady fragrance - just beautiful. I have a candle burning daily in my home while working - I highly recommend this one!"
4,15-Jun-20,5,Great scent! I just received this candle and love the scent! I was worried to order a candle never having smelled it but this one is very lemony and clean smelling. I haven't burned it yet so I can't comment on the longevity. This would be a great gift as well!
4,17-Nov-20,5,Must buy! Last for forever. Love this candle! Very long lasting. The scent isn‚Äôt as strong as I would like but it‚Äôs still very nice. I absolutely love this and plan on gifting more for the holidays.
4,26-Apr-20,2,"Dani Scent did not smell nice or high quality, reminded me of a gift store at a theme park.Only one out of this collection worth buying again was the pineapple evergreen"
4,8-Apr-20,5,Smells and burns like those ultra expensive candies This is a high quality candle that meets expectations for the much pricier candles - the scent is not too strong but just the strength you want in a candle. I will buy again as gifts-
4,10-Jun-20,5,"Fantastic Scent This candle smells AMAZING. The product was shipped in a timely manner I highly recommend this brand for an affordable candle. I have the fresh linen and it has a very strong scent that I love. The packaging is great as well, minimalistic and sleek."

4,5-Nov-19,5,"Vanilla is a great balance to the Tobacco The tobacco spice and vanilla candle was exactly what our house needed. The tobacco smell is my favorite but can sometimes overpower our house, which my wife can barely put up with. This candle has just enough vanilla to soften the tobacco and makes for a great balance smell. Everybody‚Äôs happy!"
4,14-Sep-20,5,"Smells great Just got this candle in the mail and wow does it smell good. very happy with this purchase, worth the $20."

4,14-Oct-19,5,The service is good The scent is wonderful !
4,19-Mar-20,4,"Cute but faint smell and smaller than expected I like the smell and the look, plz note that it is a smaller candle. I would avoid if you are looking for a potent smell. Certainly, for this amount of money, I would expect a little more bang for my buck smell and size-wise."
4,24-Mar-20,5,"Best candle.... ever! I have never taken the time to write a review, but this candle deserves it. I was skeptical that it would last long because it‚Äôs small. But the wick is great. The smell is amazing! I just wish the one I like would come in the larger sizes."
4,19-Nov-20,5,Really Nice Light Scent I'm not really a big candle person but wanted to have a candle in my bathroom. Really like the overall esthetic of the candle and it has a nice light scent
4,25-Dec-19,5,Great smell Love the smell! Only gripe is that it was too small!
4,15-Apr-20,4,Scent is not super strong but last FOREVER This candle lasts a REALLLLLLY long time. The scent is not super strong though.

4,8-May-20,5,"Great choice for a candle and scent! This candle smelled amazing even before lighting it! I‚Äôve seen these candles and hadn‚Äôt tried them before but I‚Äôm completely satisfied. After lighting, the awesome of fresh linen smell fills my large living room!"
4,2-Nov-20,5,"Better than Yankee candles! These candles are great, I‚Äôve had the vanilla oak and espresso bean and they both fill a big room with the scent. Better than Yankee candles!"
4,20-Dec-19,5,Happy Smells great
4,1-Apr-20,5,Here for this candle! Purchased the Black Amber candle after seeing good reviews here and on The Strategist. Smells wonderful and I can tell it will last a long time! Happy to have found this company and look forward to purchasing more candles in the future!
4,3-Nov-19,5,You'll love it! Smells amazing! I love this candle!

4,22-Dec-19,5,"My second time purchasing!! I bought this for my girlfriend again and she just loves this brand. She forced me to write this review but, we're big fans. The first scent was pineapple evergreen which smelled amazing, this one smell great as well and burns slow"
4,19-Feb-20,5,Great candle Will buy again
4,15-May-20,5,Great quality candle I love the smell and sleek look of the linen candle! Looks and smells amazing.
4,7-Aug-19,5,"Nice Gift! I purchased the Wild Lemongrass scented candle for my wife and she loved it! It's now one of her favorite candles.

4,6-Jun-19,5,Get this!! Amazing scent!!! No toxins :). Just what I was looking for!
4,25-Feb-20,4,"Overall decent, but strong scent I was surprised by the strong scent of the candle, which is overwhelmingly jasmine-scented with little detectable oud or musk notes. If you're into strong floral scents, you will like it! But if you're into darker, spicier scents like me, this one is not for you."
4,5-Feb-20,5,Great smells Great gift idea!
4,20-Oct-20,5,Smells fantastic This candle smells so good. I will be buying more for gifts. ?üëç
4,24-Jul-18,5,This candle smells really good. I am highly sensitive to fragrance. So it is difficult for me to find a candle I can stand. I bought the fresh linen scent. It is a great smelling yet not overpowering scent.
4,11-Jan-20,5,"A must have for the single man. The LuLu Candles are the must have for a hard working man that loves to keep things smelling good. They burn clean and slow. And are strong for the size and price, very happy will buy more. THANK YOU"

4,8-May-20,5,"Great fragrance I purchased the pineapple evergreen scent and it's great. The scent is strong, so you don't have to burn the candle for very long. I've only had it about a week, so not sure about the longevity, but I plan on purchasing more."
4,9-Feb-20,5,"TRUELY slow burning Smells like a good soap. Amazing technique to burn the wick slowly. On yankee candle, the flame sometimes goes to large but it‚Äôs amazing how the flame size is controlled not to exceed certain limit"
4,27-Feb-20,5,Super Cute Gift!! Bought this candle for my sister in law's birthday and she loved it. I also really like the packaging it came in.
4,17-Jul-20,5,Exactly what I was looking for I‚Äôve been searching for a long-lasting candle that would smell throughout the entire apartment and wouldn‚Äôt break the bank. So happy about this purchase! I ordered the lemongrass one and it did not disappoint. Would definitely recommend!
4,11-Aug-19,5,Excellent natural scent I love the scent of this candle - I've only tried the lemongrass so far but I have already given one as a gift. I would definitely recommend this candle and I'll be trying their other scents in the future.
4,17-Aug-20,3,Pleasant scent So far I like the candle. The scent is pleasant it kind of reminds me of mango hookah. (Cedar wood infused mango).
4,10-Apr-20,4,"soy candle I ordered this soy candle.Seems high quality, with lovely scent, Fresh LinenI'll write another review after using with more comments."
4,4-Apr-19,5,"I want to try more lulu candles...this is my first I love the fragrance - it has a ‚Äúromantic‚Äù sense about it and a warming feeling at the same time.  I appreciate the simplicity of the ‚Äúpackage‚Äù, though it brings much more."
4,27-Aug-20,5,"Great quality I absolutely love this brand, every candle I‚Äôve received has smelled amazing! Just received the apple cinnamon and am loving that one as well. These make great gifts and are good quality, long-lasting candles."

4,10-Nov-20,5,"Small but Mighty! This candle may be smaller than others I have, but the scent is much stronger! I have this in an upstairs room, and when lit the scent travels all throughout my home. Would definitely recommend!"
4,10-Feb-20,5,You basically NEED one of these candles Wish I could give this candle more than 5 stars. I purchased ‚Äúsexy man‚Äù simply because it was a nickname near and dear to my heart of someone I know. I wasn‚Äôt expecting such an incredible smell but I‚Äôm so pleased with this product.
4,20-Mar-19,4,"This tiny bugger packs a punch! For such a small candle this thing really puts out alot of scent!  Before even lighting it, the smell was very strong and made my mouth water!

4,14-May-20,1,Gives me a head ache This scent gives me a pounding head ache. Not sure why but it does. Maybe trying another scent is best
4,5-Oct-20,5,"Would buy again! I was nervous to purchase a candle online without smelling it, but the notes of amber and musk reeled me in. It's a very subtle scent that smells quality and relaxing! The packaging is very simple and chic and it burns well!"
4,10-Jun-20,5,Best Holiday Scent! I JUST received this candle and if you COULD bottle the scent that is holiday‚Äî- this would be it. Well done LULU looking forward to buying more!
4,6-Aug-19,5,Single? A GQ? Want to get the girl? This is the candle Candle smell very very good. I‚Äôve bought many candles from many different brands. This is definitely in my top 3 now. Thanks!
4,15-Jul-20,4,"Smells great. Room filling scent. Although the candle could have been slightly larger, it is still a nice size and the scent fills the room. I cannot speak to longevity yet, but I'm happy with the candles. I would probably buy these again."
4,6-Aug-20,5,"Favorite Go to Candle! I stumbled across these candles and decided to give them a try. They are now my go to candles - fresh linen is my favorite. Great for your home or gifting to someone. I highly recommend these candles. Thank you, Lulu!"
4,1-Aug-20,5,"Great scent! I love the smell of this candle! I wish there was a little more product for the cost, but I also believe the price is worth it because our house smelled amazing within minutes of lighting."

4,7-Apr-20,1,No scent :( No scent. None. Zero. Unless you need light this candle is worthless.
4,6-Nov-20,5,Best candle This product is great especially for a gift it smells very nice and last for a long period of time. No complaints other than the box will sometimes fall off of the candle depending on which way you hold it. 5 stars overall.
4,25-Oct-20,5,"Nicest candle I've had I bought the Fresh Linen scent because the other reviewers suggested it. I like it! It's not too overpowering and burns pretty cleanly. Might have to try the other scents sometime, maybe wild lemongrass for the dining area."
4,20-Sep-20,5,"Great candle Great candle. The smell is strong but not overpowering (I‚Äôve had overly strong candles give me headaches, but not this one). I actually had it for a few days without lighting it because it already made the room smell great."
4,18-Sep-20,5,Product worth your time and effort I've been using this candle for the past month and it truly does succeed in its fragrance while burning and how long the candle lasts. I read the rave reviews for the Pineapple Evergreen and I have to say it lives up to it.

4,3-Aug-19,5,Makes a lovely gift I bought this as a gift and it came nicely packaged and smelled so good.
4,1-Jun-20,5,best scented candle This is one of best candle i have received. The best part is even you don't burn it it makes its presence by it beautiful fragrance. also it lasts long. Once burned in good sized room the fragrance last for 2-3 days in that room.
4,14-Apr-20,4,Vanilla Oak Smells nice Its not overly powerful. My Girlfriend is sensitive to powerful smells this was perfect. clean little sweet. small note this candle did not come with a cap. no big deal.
4,25-Jun-20,5,Great smelling candle! I bought the Blueberry Cobbler scented candle and it smells delicious. This small candle really produces a strong smell that makes the entire room smell great even after the candle has been put out. I will definitely buy more Lulu Candles.
4,13-Nov-20,4,"Nice Candle Its hard to order a candle online, but this LuLu candle in Fresh Linen Scent is just what I was hoping for. The scent is light and looks just like the one pictured. I'm happy with my purchase."

4,2-May-19,5,Great Scent and No Headaches Received the Jasmine infused Bergamot several days ago and have been burning it everyday.  Love the light fresh scent that fills the house. Everyone has mentioned that it is pleasant and asked me to email them the link.  No headaches and the scent does not upset the dog or cats as many often seem to send them out of the room. Will repurchase for sure.
4,29-May-20,5,"Great smell, love this candle I got this candle first in the vanilla oak (my favorite scent so far) and now trying the linen and also got a third one to try too. They smell great and burn nicely, so I will probably try all the scents to find my favorite. You can't go wrong!"

4,28-Feb-20,5,THe smell is wonderfull and it lasts a long time! The packaging was very good. The smell is not overpowering. It lasted a long time. There was hardly any black soot. The first one I got worked so well that I bought three more (one for mom)! I will be trying out the different smells you offer. DONT CHANGE!!
4,31-May-20,5,"Amazing packaging and smell I was nervous to buy a candle that I haven't smelled yet. I wanted a candle for my bathroom which is pretty tiny. So, if the smell was too strong, it would be pretty overwhelming. However, the candle surprised me. It had a nice and soft smell."
4,26-Apr-19,4,"Great, I didn't get a lid I love the longevity! The scent could be steonger. My candle DID not come with a lid. I'll rate 5 stars if that gets fixed"

4,5-Nov-20,5,"New favorite candle! Love these candles! The scent is the perfect combination of sweet and masculine. Truly long burning, burns down to the very end,  and the wick does not disintegrate/disappear. Have re-ordered them already."

4,9-Nov-20,5,"Sugared Pecan - perfect fall candle The sugared pecan scent feels warm and inviting, sweet but just enough. perfect for fall. Like other reviewers described, kind of like a pie in the oven. The packaging is simple and classy, very giftable."
4,19-Jan-20,4,Non-Toxic Sexy Scented Candle LOVE the masculine smell of the ‚ÄòSexy Man‚Äô candle and was happy to find a non-toxic soy candle option to replace a similar scented toxic candle that I had been getting for years. Only wish it had been a bit bigger as it was small than expected. Will definitely order again!
4,8-Apr-20,5,"But it now Love, love, love this candle! It's by far my new favorite. Even when it's not lit the open jar gives off a fragrant aroma. Don't overthink this purchase, just go for it - you won't be disappointed!!!"

4,18-Oct-20,5,Awesome! Great unique smell!
4,21-Aug-20,4,"Interesting Scent This a good soy candle for the price point, stays burning and the scent is pretty strong. I though this one would be a little more tropical and woodsy but the scent is overwhelmingly pineapple. Which still smells great!"
4,14-Aug-20,4,Just Ok Good candle but it‚Äôs definitely a lot smaller than I thought it would be. You‚Äôre better off waiting for bath and body works to have a 3 wick candle sale and then you‚Äôll get a way better candle for the same price as this
4,3-Jul-20,2,Smells horrible Smells horrible
4,12-Feb-20,5,Best scent of all time I love this candle. I've bought it several times. People constantly react to how great my office smells when I'm burning it. I should probably just subscribe to get one every month.
4,19-Jul-20,4,Smells good Wanted a coffee scented candle and this one does the trick.
4,26-Oct-18,5,Perfect for kitchen I really liked the jasmine oud candle. A bit pricey but maybe worth it. I can tell it will last a long time. The smell is a bit strong but that's how I like it. It's perfect for getting rid of kitchen smells after the cooking.

4,28-Dec-18,5,Fresh Linen smells wonderful! I've already ordered another scent to try. They're smaller candles but smell great.
4,4-Oct-20,5,Came Exactly as described The candle came in nice durable packaging and smells great. I tried a new scent this time and this one is equally as great. I cannot wait to try another scent after this one!

4,15-Feb-20,5,"Smells for days This candle filled my entire room with tobacco and vanilla scent, and I haven't even burnt it yet. It's a little bit more powdery and heavy on the vanilla compared to the paddywax version if you're coming from there as well."

4,11-Jun-20,5,"Great product perfect scent Awesome scent product that I had been searching for, I used to use jo Malone series, however they are too expensive; if you are looking for a new one to get; this is a great option! Highly recommended and I just order another one! Love it"
4,1-Jun-20,5,Anti-anxiety aromatherapy This candle is helping me deal with the current stress in my community and the world. Thank you for helping me relax.

4,13-Apr-20,5,My new love:) I love the scent of this candle- it is fresh without being too overpowering- and it fills the whole first floor!  I have been so surprised at how long this candle can burn- I will definitely be buying more scents from Lulu!!
4,18-Jul-20,3,Strong scent Expensive for how little candle you get. The linen smell is a bit strong for me but it does cover any other odors well.
4,19-Mar-20,5,love it! I always like to find a good deal on smaller sized candles that last a long time and this one checks those boxes! Plus it also smells great!!! 100% would recommend for yourself or to give as a gift :D
4,24-Oct-19,5,Perfect candle for a good price Perfect candle for a good price. The quality is good and also the smell. The packaging of this candle is simple and Staylish. i also really appreciate that it comes with a lid because it blocks the smoke from blowing out the candle. I would definitely purchase another candle from this company.
4,8-May-20,5,"Accurate scent This candle is great & perfect for the price. The Espresso Bean smells just how you think a coffee shop would on any given morning. I wish it would have burnt a little slower, but nevertheless I would highly recommend!"
4,10-Nov-20,4,Hard to Buy Candles online It is hard to buy candles online since you can't actually smell in advance. I selected this based on previous reviews and love the scent. It burns a great deal slower I thought and fills the room. I would buy it again.
4,12-Feb-19,5,"Burns 4 Days! Fresh Linen has a nice mild scent. Candle seemed to burn forever. Great service, even came with an extra small gift. Would definitely purchase again. Looking forward to trying the different candle scents."
4,24-Feb-19,5,"Beautiful coffee smell The paper this candle was wrapped in smelled so good that it was worth the purchase price. The candle itself had a strong,  fresh coffee smell that is incredible if coffee is your thing. This will probably be my first of several of these candles."
4,21-Apr-20,4,Smells like the name! This candle truly smells like you just ate a blueberry yogurt or backed a blueberry pie. Not the most relaxing sent but very different than any other candle I have.
4,27-Aug-19,5,"A must have! So my girlfriend warned me about getting candles online and i get it but the reviews here were what sold me. I was not disappointed... this clean linen scent was exactly what i was looking for and now that I know Amazon has my candle, ill be reordering and reordering."
4,23-Jun-20,5,Smells so good I could smell it before i even opened the package!
4,7-Dec-19,5,Midnight in Paris. I love everything about this candle. Candle has a beautiful perfume. It isn't strong and smell but very seductive. I will definitely reorder this candle again.
4,27-Apr-20,5,LOVE I was so surprised how good this candle smelled! I got the Lemongrass for my entry way and you can smell it all throughout the house. Definitely would buy again.
4,16-Feb-20,5,"The scent is amazing. The fragrance is spot on. It smells like a coffee house,not artificial. It appears to be a long lasting, slow burning soy candle. Yes I plan on purchasing another. Must be made with love."
4,3-Mar-20,5,"Great Candle I have been looking for a good candle that my girlfriend also likes.  I have tried a few brands, and this one is my favorite so far.  The jar looks nice and it smells great.  It is good for relaxing and watching a movie.  Definitely recommend this one."
4,9-Jul-19,5,Love these candles! The scents are wonderful.  The fresh linen smells so clean. The lemon biscotti makes the whole house smell like fresh baked biscotti.  I've given a few as gifts as well and the recipients have loved them so much they ordered some too!
4,19-Jun-20,5,"Great candle!  Would highly recommend. The old adage you get what you pay for definitely applies here.  Though the candle might be a little pricey, it smells fantastic and lasts for a very long time.  I would highly recommend."
4,5-Jun-20,5,Very Strong Scent The candle smells just as strong as advertised! I also have two cats so since it is a soy candle it doesn‚Äôt bother them. I got the lavender scent and it is just enough to not cause a headache but also to be able to smell it! Great candle!
4,28-Jul-20,5,"Excellent candle I couldn't believe the scent, as soon as I opened the box it's smelled like a freshly baked blueberry pie.  Inside the glass looks to have a stylish higher end look with a ceramic glaze.Next is vanilla oak!"
4,1-Oct-20,2,"Sickly sweet and artificial Cute packaging but the scent is terrible - cloying, chemical and barely smells of espresso (the one I got)."
4,1-Nov-20,5,"Long Lasting It smells great (jasmine, oud, and sandalwood), and it truly is slow burning. I've had it lit for around 15 hours over the last three days, and it has not melted appreciably. I have a feeling it will last a long time."
4,28-Sep-20,5,"Pineapple evergreen is amazing! Loving the pineapple evergreen scent ‚Äî very glad I listened to the reviews! I also have the fresh linen candle, which I don‚Äôt like as much, but if you‚Äôre into the Lysol fresh linen scent, it could be a candle for you."
4,6-Nov-20,5,"Smell fills the room! I love this candle! It smells very good, and is strong enough to fill a room with the scent. Where I'm at, it delivered the next day. Definitely would recommend this as a gift for loved ones or as a gift for yourself!"
4,30-Jul-20,5,Smells just like blueberry cobbler! Strong and lasting scent. I‚Äôve been looking for a more natural type candle that won‚Äôt affect my allergies. I really love blueberry scents so I thought I‚Äôd give this a try and I love it! I keep it in my room and you can smell it through the entire house.
4,4-Jan-20,5,"LOVE!!! I absolutely love these candles! They are long burning and smell awesome. I have the linen, the blueberry cobbler, sweet pea jasmine apple, the lemon vanilla bean too!  Love them all and sooooo worth every single penny"

4,22-Jul-20,5,Scent is amazing This candle is the perfect size for a decorative candle that packs a powerful room filling scent when lit. We also found out that unlit you can smell the candle when passing by it. This is one of the best candles we have bought.
4,20-Nov-20,5,"subtle coffee smell This is a nice candle. I bought it for my husband as a stocking stuffer because he loves the smell of coffee. It‚Äôs a very subtle scent, but still smells good!"

4,18-Aug-20,2,Smells great but 6 oz incredibly small Smells great but be wary of the size you choose. Way too expensive for 6 ounce size.
4,8-Oct-20,5,"Great Santal Candle This a a cute candle that throws a big scent! I got the Jasmine, Oud and Santal scent. It is lovely and totally comparable to luxe brands candle. Will definitely purchase more as gifts for the upcoming holiday season."

4,7-May-20,5,Breath of fresh air The candle exceeded my expectations given that I‚Äôve ordered from others and the fragrance Of this particular maker is amazing. I enjoy coming home to a soothing scent. Highly recommended
4,7-Jan-19,5,Fragrant and divine! Smells great and I love the look! Definitely worth it.
4,24-Aug-19,5,Relaxing and Calming scent I'm the type that has to smell the candle directly. I bought this scent purely from the positive reviews. At first I didn't like the scent and requested for a refund. As I kept smelling it grew on me. Its the type of scent that has hints of nature like the name itself.
4,4-Sep-20,4,"Great looking, Classy, Manly This candle looks really good. The black glass is very clean and would look fantastic where ever you put it. The smell is also very good.  It was not what I was expecting but I would definitely recommend this candle."

4,16-Apr-20,5,The wick I love these candles. The wick size appears proper because it burns evenly and very clean. The aroma/fragrance smell is in the space without overpowering the space. I‚Äôll order these as often as I need them.
4,2-Aug-20,5,Smells Amazing! The blueberry cobbler candle smells amazing! I love that I have found candles that have a great smell without giving me a headache from such strong scent and harmful substances in the candle.  Highly recommend!
4,1-Aug-20,5,Great candle This is such a luxury item that it's a really great gift for that person who loves freshness in their life. The linen is so clean smelling without being overpowering. I love the size - will be purchasing again!
4,30-Jun-20,5,"It's great for gifting. Most people loves a good candle. I love everything about this candle. It has a lasting, clean burning, light, but noticeable scent. I've had visitors comment on, "" your house smells good"".  I've ordered it as a gift for my daughter,  and will be gifting to others."
4,29-May-20,5,Lovely fragrance Love this candle
4,15-Oct-19,5,"Good quality materials, very nice quality and quantity of fragrance Really nice fragrances (apple spice and amber rose musk) that aren‚Äôt overwhelming or artificial smelling but are definitely noticeable/lasting. These candles lightly fragrance the area when not being burned which I love. Pricey but the materials and quality back it up."
4,29-Sep-19,3,"smells great, but very small Great candle but so small for the price."
4,8-Feb-19,5,Value First time buying this candle and I love it already my whole room smells so good.. will be getting more

4,12-May-20,4,"Cedarwood Mango- Fruity with a twist Good fruity scent! The fruitiness of the mango outweighed the cedar. If you like fruity but want a weird twist to the normal overpowering of straight up fruit scents, this ones for you!"
4,4-Nov-19,5,"No. 9 Pineapple Evergreen is my new favorite! I have been looking for a pineapple scent candle. Love the scent sweet but not too much! I got the fresh linen No. 5 as well.

4,21-Nov-18,5,"Awesome aroma, highly recommend! The smell of the candle is noticeable but very subtle nothing to overwhelming. It burns very clean, I did trim the wick for better burning.

4,14-Nov-18,4,"smell fills room I really like the packaging and how the candle smell fills the whole room without being overbearing. I bought wild lemongrass which smells really refreshing but when you sit too close to the candle it smells strongly of kid vitamins which makes me a bit nauseous. Overall good purchase, but I would get a different scent."

4,4-Apr-19,5,"Love the fresh linen scent I bought the fresh linen candle because it's one of the best sellers on Amazon. Personally, I love it a lot! It does smell like freshly done laundry, but some other people may not like it. So, the smell is pretty much similar to lightly scented laundry detergent lol."
4,23-Nov-20,4,"Lavender musk scent This candle is the perfect size for any coffee table or dining room table! Wonderful packaging. The lavender musk scent is a little more musky than I thought it would be, but it still smells good."

4,7-Apr-19,4,"Refreshing Scent, Great Price I really like the wild lemongrass candle. It's a pretty long-lasting candle for the price. The scent is a tiny bit artificial but for the price is definitely the most authentic scent you can usually get in that range. The container is cute and works very nicely in my kitchen. Would recommend! :)"
4,1-May-19,5,"Long lasting, great smelling candle Don‚Äôt let the size fool you.  This candle lasts longer that other candles twice the size and packs a scent punch like the Floyd Mayweather of candles.  As a dude, I‚Äôm not super into candles, but this is one I‚Äôll 100% buy again."

4,25-Jan-19,5,"Perfect Candle for End-of-Day Relaxation The candle is a little strong nearby which is fine, nothing is perfect for all situations. I recommend the candle, just make sure the candle is at least 3 feet away from you. Love the scent and reminds me of clean sheets."
4,22-May-20,4,"Very long lasting. Worth it. At first you think ""what a small candle!"" However, it lasts a long long time. With other candles the wax on the side is wasted. Not with this candle. I have bought 2x and will buy again."

4,16-Jan-20,5,Pineapple evergreen I LOVE lulu‚Äôs candles. My favorite has been the cedarwood infused mango (No. 29) but I haven‚Äôt been above to find it so I needed a replacement so I tried the pineapple evergreen and it is just as amazing!

4,22-Jul-19,5,Divine smell. The scent is divine. I got the pineapple evergreen. The most important thing for me is that is a natural candle and no harsh chemicals. I already recommended to my friend. Will buy it again.
4,19-Aug-20,5,Yummm This candle smells exactly like blueberry cobbler!  It's not too sweet and is perfect for fall/winter. I will definitely be purchasing more scents.
4,16-Jan-20,4,"Too small, but great smell Although I wish I would had paid more attention to the size (6oz too small) it is a great scented candle for my studio apartment"
4,21-Sep-19,5,Great buy I ordered the Pineapple Evergreen and the smell is amazing! Not overwhelming but made the whole house smell great. Burned it all night and it barely looks used. I have no doubt that it will last as long as they say. Will definitely be ordering more.
4,19-Aug-19,3,"Tiny Candle for the Cost This candle was well-reviewed, so I took a chance and ordered it.  It does smell very nice, but it is quite small.  I can buy bigger candles with better scents from local vendors for half the cost."
4,3-Feb-20,5,"Long burning and scrumptious! I love my Lulu candle! I‚Äôm a person who constantly has a candle lit at home for the vibes and smell, so I‚Äôve been burning this baby a lot and lasts a whileee. It‚Äôs burning as we speak! The amber smell is DELICIOUS."

4,22-Aug-20,5,Amazing scent!! It smells amazing. I honestly did not expect evergreen and pinapple to mesh but it is amazing!
4,4-Jun-20,5,Fresh Scent This scent is perfect for any space. It isn't too strong where you walk into a room and it knocks you back. We have the candle burning in our studio and it keeps the whole place smelling fresh. 10/10 reccommend!
4,9-Jul-20,1,"they smell great, but wicks are awful and you end up throwing the whole candle away 50% burned waste of money because the wicks are awful and 50% of the candle is left when the candle stops staying lit"
4,21-May-20,5,"Yep, smells good I bought 2 candles; Wild lemon grass and Pineapple evergreen. Both smell great, but we love the Pineapple Evergreen. It's been lasting for quite sometime. I would definitely recommend."
4,25-Apr-20,4,"Very mild, but smells great! The product is much smaller than I expected, but it smells great. I wish the scent was a little bit stronger because it doesn't fill an entire room, but nonetheless a great candle."

4,10-Oct-20,5,A Smell that will light up your whole life This carries a great sand I'm totally addicted to..... I just bought on October 7 so I'm waiting to see how long it lasts burning it every night. 6 oz is really small but let's see
4,9-May-20,5,"Definitely buying again! I was wary buying a candle solely off amazon reviews. However, I was pleasantly surprised with the quality and fragrant but not overpowering scent. I would definitely buy it again!"
4,15-Mar-20,4,"Smells Great For such a small size the candle smells great. So far it seems to burn well, but I haven't timed it. The cover is a nice touch when putting it out.  Wish it had been available in a larger size."

4,25-Dec-18,5,"Great scent, elegant design, fair price. Bought the fresh linen candle because I didn't want an overbearing or fruity scent. Was present and subtle which I liked. Lasted a good amount of time. If used occasionally, this should last you over a month, if heavily used, then it will likely last for about a month or so."
4,11-Jun-20,5,"Perfect Gift Size Bought this as a gift for a friend, and its the perfect size and I love the sophisticated label! Bought the fresh linen smell and its lovely."

4,7-Nov-18,4,"Smells Great, burns surprisingly long Burned this bad boy for an entire night, looked at it in the morning as I blew it out and it seemed like it barely even used any wax/fuel.

4,15-Nov-20,5,Amazing Scent! I love the scent of this candle!! It makes an excellent gift and smells amazing!!
5,4-Mar-18,5,"Smell amazing, don't bother me I received the ""peace + tranquility"" candle as a gift for Christmas. I loved the smell so I wanted to try others. ""Joy + laughter"" smells amazing. I will say ""peace + tranquility"" has a more clean/refreshing smell, while ""joy + laughter"" is more sweet- almost like a perfume. I plan to try more scents in the future because I love these so much! Definitely would recommend. PS. I am sensitive to strong scents (sometimes get headaches from them) and these do not bother me."
5,18-Jan-18,5,"As a huge consumer of candles, this one is one of my top 5! I use a lot of candles from different brand because my husband smokes sometimes (off the window) and I keep putting candles in every room to make sure there is no smell. This is probably one of my favorite ones, not too strong, very pleasant and nice smell, not overwhelming but it works to camouflage bad odors. Ordering more!"
5,1-Sep-18,4,"affordable For the price It's not a bad scented candle option.I like to have a candle burning in my studio but I don't like to burn my expensive candles there so I'm always looking for more affordable options. The problem is I haven't found a single affordable option that does not tunnel. It's like they just can't get the right wicks for the diameter of their candles. This one tunnels as well (even with a first burn of 4+ hours) BUT the tunneling seems to sort itself out after the third or fourth burn, which is acceptable. The throw on this candle is very nice and it burns cleanly as long as you keep the wick properly trimmed. As such I'll repurchase again for use in my studio."
5,8-Jun-18,5,"LOVE IT I absolutely live for candles! Doesn't matter what brand, I just do. Then Amazon came along and got introduced to Chesapeake Bay! Unfortunately I received 1 of the 3 candles I ordered and it was completely shattered so they are sending me a new one at no charge! (WHY I LOVE AMAZON.)I orderedSimplicity + HopeReflection + ClarityPeace + TranquilityI currently have Simplicity + Hope lit and it's delicious, and minty! Very similar to Stress Relief from Bath & Body Works.If I could have a lifetime supply of these I would sign up for it! Extremely satisfied with my purchase and also extremely sad one came broken :("
5,24-May-18,5,Very pleasant aroma. Looks nice too. We always get compliments about the pleasant scent of this candle.  I've bought two of them now and am about to purchase a third one.
5,23-Jan-18,5,"favorite candle looks beautiful, and smells amazing! Saw few reviews here that the fragrance can be smelled only around the candle, i light it in my living room and can smell it on the second floor i every room."
5,10-Jun-18,5,"Simply the best candle for candle lovers. I love candles and have purchased just about every  brand offered at amazon and Chesapeake Bay is by far my favorite. I've purchased both small candle bundles and at least a dozen medium sized candles. Every scent is my favorite but right now I'm loving ""love & passion"",""peace & tranquility"" and ""Balance & Harmony""The candles themselves are beautiful. the wooden topper is a nice touch. the scent, of the smaller candles, is strong enough for a bedroom and doesn't fade as the candle is burning. 4 piece sets would make a great gift.haven't had a bad candle, broken candle or a miss yet.highly recommend"
5,17-Nov-18,5,"A winner I purchased this product because it popped up as well-liked and not too expensive. As is often the case on Amazon, you buy something and you're not sure if it will turn out to be a dud. I am pleased to write that this product has not disappointed and I am overall quite satisfied. The scent of the oils is actually quite mild and pleasant (though we are using it in a large space). I feared that it might be too obtrusive or overpowering as many scented products tend to be. The frosted glass is quite nice and the oil, so far, has lasted for many weeks. It's probably already been a couple of months and the fluid level has only declined by about 1/3. The base has a slight gumminess, which I didn't expect, but now appreciate because it probably prevents unwanted spills. All in all, this is a winner and, compared to similar items, well worth the price."
5,28-Oct-18,3,I love the smell... question the durability. Love the smell and look of these candles.I am concerned about the durability however... the glass exploded (pictures attached) as the wick ran near the bottom of the glass... I‚Äôve never seen a candle do that before.
5,5-Jan-19,1,"I wouldn‚Äôt order again I bought 4 packs of 2. 4 total candles were in ok shape. 1 was shattered, 3 had scratches to the wood top. 2 had scratches to the glass sides. Most had weird uneven air pockets where it looked like the candles had melted while laying on their side. Bought and shipped in December, so they didn‚Äôt sit in any heat. Definitely won‚Äôt buy again. I guess I now need to go to the trouble of shipping broken glass back to amazon, ugh."
5,14-Dec-18,1,Shattered glass and not returnable = unacceptable Amazon This is my first Amazon review ever because I am in disbelief... would give zero stars. Do NOT buy this product. It arrived completely broken with shattered glass and is ‚Äúnot returnable.‚Äù I might as well have thrown $20 in the trash. Shattered glass is not a Christmas gift.
5,15-Jan-19,5,"This Candle snd packaging is well made and smells soooo good I love this candle. I‚Äôve never purchased a candle without smelling it first but the description given about the candle grabbed and pulled me in. I‚Äôm glad too, because I recently received my second one. I also want to add that it‚Äôs smell is strong (in a good way). I may burn it for 15 minutes s day and the scrumptious smell lingers all day long. Well worth the money and will be trying some of their other smells."
5,29-Jul-18,1,"Instant headache. Instant regret. I purchased the mint+basil candle hoping it would smell like mint and basil, two lovely herbs that are very calming. NOPE. Does not smell like mint, nor doea it smell like basil. The second I smelled this candle I had a headache from the artificial perfumey weirdness. Cannot describe how awful this is. Only buy this if you love pain and suffering."
5,3-Nov-18,1,"SAFE & NATURAL?  I DON'T THINK SO!!!!! B E W A R E !!!!!!!! First of all, there is NO scent to this candle, but that is not what has me so upset.  When burning, it is so smokey, sooty & even with the wick trimmed.  As far as being safe, if they have to put on the candle ""No ADDED Formaldehyde"", how much is in it already????? This was the WORST candle I have EVER purchased. It says  ""California Formaldehyde Compliant""!!!!  This is the very first candle that ever had those words written on it.  Needless to say, when I just took it out of my collection to start burning it, and read all this (today!)  It went right in the trash shortly after lighting it as I was negligent in reading it first. SHAME ON ME!!!!!  No, I can't get a refund,  because they closed the window of returns, but I will NEVER buy one of their product again!"
5,16-Sep-18,5,"This candle smells holy god good I specifically buy this candle in the Peace & Tranquility scent. It's incredibly relaxing, and smells really soft and nice. I light it at night, maybe an hour before I get ready for bed. I found this candle at target initially, for double the price that the medium candle sells for here. It looks like target has since lowered their price, but I'll still buy it here."
5,13-Apr-19,5,"Decent overall for the price Nice looking candle with decent scent, liked my first reflection+clarity candle so I'm trying new one. Both candles are not so gendered, will match well with any not-so-all-pink spaces. Go reflection+clarity if you want gender-neutral calmness with a hint of sweetness, and go awaken+invigorate if you would like to clear the air and refresh yourself with citrusy notes.+ don't attempt to blow the candle, it may cause a dangerous and unpleasant situation due to the very liquidy melt wax. Always use the lid to turn it off."
5,15-Dec-18,5,"Lovely scent Bought the Peace and Tranquility diffuser for our guest bathroom and I love it. The smell is really nice - strong at first but seems to lessen after the first couple weeks. Looks nice too, no issues with delivery, it was packed well. A couple sticks were a little bent but nothing to be bothered about. A plan to purchase more oil when this one runs out. Definitely recommend."
5,17-May-19,5,"Great candle! Smells great, burns all the way (see tips in review) This candle smells great. Burns well. And burns all the way to the bottom. The only explanation I think is necessary for this review is:To ensure this candle (or any other candle for that matter) burns as efficiently as possible trim the wick per the instructions on most candles. If there aren't any see below for common recommendations:Trim wick 3/4 and always trim after each burn.Only burn for 2-4 hours depending on candle.Try not to leave the candle lit in a drifty area or when it's really windy some days with the windows open.Those steps have always led to properly burned candle. Simple as that.Highly recommend."
5,5-Apr-18,1,Wasted money THESE candles have no smell when burning. Very disappointed
5,10-May-17,3,"Body Deodorant Smell I love the container that this candle is held in. The scent however smells a little musty and like cologne. To some, that's appealing, but honestly for me it smelled like a high school men's locker room. I did try their mint/basil however and it was fantastic."
5,10-May-19,1,"This fragrance is not what you would expect from eucalyptus and lemon fees. This scent is absolutely awful in my opinion. I wouldn‚Äôt gift it to anyone I know because I wouldn‚Äôt want to smell it when I go see them. I can‚Äôt imagine this scent getting this many good reviews because even if there are people who like it, no one that has smelled it liked it from my experience, so it certainly isn‚Äôt a fragrance that is somewhat universal. There are multiple layers of fragrances but it doesn‚Äôt smell really like the crisp eucalyptus or lemongrass smell to me. It doesn‚Äôt smell clean. There‚Äôs a heavy cologne smell at the end of the smell as well."
5,1-Apr-18,5,"good for use in a room where you want to ... Very gentle smell, good for use in a room where you want to freshen up the space without overwhelming the senses"
5,14-Dec-17,1,"Absoutly No Fragrence Had to return. Absoutly no fragrence. It was supposed to be ""peace and tranquility"". I was ""disappointed and frustrated"", because I had the hassle of returning it."
5,9-Sep-19,3,"Lid is easy to remove, good for small spaces, scent is adequate I purchased the Rose Water scent and placed it in my bathroom. All in all I should have ordered the cashmere scented one. Kind of regretting it but since I bought it for $20 (it's kinda pricey for a small container), I am using the scent till it runs out. Also fits nicely on small sink countertops. I don't pour the oil into the glass because I like it empty and dry. I actually just dip the sticks into the bottle and keep the wet tip facing upwards and it scents the bathroom quickly without being messy. To get a nice scent without being too overpowering I'd recommend dipping the sticks an inch deep. Any more the scent can be too overpowering imo. I'm the type that doesn't really like patchouli smells but as long as it's minimal, it keeps the bathroom smelling fresh for a few days. Next time I'll keep to scents that I know and love"
5,14-Apr-18,1,"One Star Sage and sea salt candle smells terrible. No reflection and clarity, just bad aftershave cologne smell..."
5,28-Apr-18,4,Cashmere Jasmine Peace and Tranquility is just that! Smells ... Cashmere Jasmine Peace and Tranquility is just that!  Smells potent without overpowering. Calming jasmine with the freshness of cashmere is a magnificent combination.  So relaxing!
5,23-Oct-18,5,"Perfect for the 'Powder Room' & I mean that in a good way for a reason... I chose this company because it's name: CHESAPEAKE BAY CANDLES. The name brought back some good childhood memories of growing up as a U.S. Army Brat in Maryland and around the Chesapeake Bay. Patronizing the shops and homemade goods. Simpler, somewhat soothing, relaxing times.Anyways, this candle has a slow burn & a light to medium 'throw'.  But I must admit, I didn't get a hint of jasmine or cashmere. Unless cashmere and jasmine are supposed to smell like lightly scented hand soap, bleach and fresh fern & a hint of honeysuckle/ moss covered waterfalls in a national park. Which it isn't supposed to. And mind you I was burning this in my living room. Not the bathroom & no bleach anywhere. In fact I'm fresh out. Go figure.It's all in the NOSE OF THE BEHOLDER. lol Who knows? You might actually smell the jasmine or cashmere... or something else completely different. Hopefully pleasing to your olfactory senses.But it's a win all the same and functions perfectly in the loo. The fragrance is perfect without being too heady. No heinous powdery or perfumed or even 'fabric softener type' scents that are popular; the latter I sometimes grab like every other person out there.  Also, no high flame or flare up. Nevertheless, you should still keep a close eye on any candle. Because it has such a light but clean & fresh smell, this candle functions best in a small space: restroom, den, an office space, a guest room. You get the idea.It is a ""tranquil"" aroma that's a gentler way to start your day with your morning shower.  I look forward to testing out CHESAPEAKE BAY CANDLE'S other goods."
5,20-Jun-19,1,"Scent? What scent? I was sold on getting one since they had so many great reviews! Upon unboxing, it was packed up really well and thought I had my a great purchase. Boy was I wrong! The frosted glass cylinder does not attach to the wooden top whatever so that's a hazard waiting to happen. Now on to the 'oil' if you want to call it that. It was super thin like water and barely smelled of anything. I set up the reeds regardless and hoped for the best, but that never happened. It smelled of chemicals and NOT essential oils as they claimed. Literal waste of money and I would buy drugstore candles over this nonsense. Overpriced garbage."
5,12-Sep-18,1,So disappointed Based on the reviews I thought I would be getting a very aromatic candle. I can‚Äôt even smell it!
5,21-Mar-19,5,"serenity + calm is the best so far! I've had a few of this brand of candle. So far, ""serenity + calm"" (lavender thyme) is my favorite. I use it every single day. Least favorite was probably ""balance + harmony"" (water lily pear) because its overpowering and just not a pleasant smell to me. I've had ""confidence + freedom"" and ""peace + tranquility"" which were mild scents but I wasnt impressed enough to buy them again. I will continue buying the lavender thyme one! Good candles for being so cheap."
5,26-Oct-19,2,"Oil or scented water? I just wrote a review of the same candle, though I am not a person who writes reviews, but I am so disappointed in these purchases I thought it warrented reviewing. I purchased the Courage and Wisdom diffuser two years ago and loved it. It one of my favorite aromas. It scented my whole bedroom. The oil lasted a long time. I just purchased three more to have around the house. However, when I poured the oil into the jar it is more like water than oil and doesn't last very long at all.  What's more is that there are no refills (questioning whether I would want a refill at this point, but should have option) and the scent is off from my last purchase. Previously it was a strong, beautiful aroma, now it light and doesn't smell quite the same. Again, wondering if I just got a bad batch or if they've changed the recipe. I certainly hope it's just a bad batch because I love the Courage and Wisdom aroma, it's so earthy.Chesapeake Bay- please change the recipe back and offer diffuser refills."
5,14-Jan-18,5,"Really pleased.. This has such a delightful scent.  I originally purchased this as a gift for a friend.  When I received it I of course opened it and smelled it and immediately loved the fragrance.  I gave her the one I purchased for her, but then I went and ordered myself one.  Upon initially burning it I was disappointed at how little scent I could smell being spread throughout the room.. unless you were directly near the candle.  However, upon longer burning and relighting multiple times I can say that the scent does in fact carry well.  The scent itself is light and clean smelling.  It is not at all overwhelming or irritating to my sinuses.  I will definitely purchase this scent again as well as others from this brand.  I am really just pleased at the overall performance of this candle."
5,12-Dec-18,4,"Good candle, not so much the scent... Note:  This is a completely subjective review.  The candle is in a nice glass container and the candle itself burns clean (assuming you're trimming the wick as needed) and seems to last quite some time.  I burn one of these for at least 4 hours total and it only burned about half an inch down.  Overall, the candle as a whole is a good quality product.  It's in a nice container, burns clean, emits just enough scent without being overwhelming.  That being said, I do not particularly like this scent.  The scent is more of a perfume smell rather than a fruity/pear smell.  Please keep this in mind when considering this review, as a scent is a completely subjective to an individual.  I will not provide a recommend or not recommend due to this."
5,11-Jul-20,4,"Reflection and Clarity The candle smells so good. I really like it.PROS: 1. if you like subtle, delicate scents, this is your candle.2. This is the perfect bathroom/bubble bath or bedroom/quite nights candle. Not overpowering, wonderful soft scent, and it won‚Äôt invade the rest of the house easily.3. The sent softly lingers for those with good sniffers.CONS: 1. because it‚Äôs not even close to overpowering, or just a tad strong, it can‚Äôt compete with other smells you might have going on..... dog farts, cooking, etc.....2. It wont smell up the bottom floor of a small appt unless it‚Äôs been burning for over an hour. If you want something that makes the HOUSE (not a room) smell good and sticks around (what I was looking for) this is not it.3. Burns pretty fast, especially when you‚Äôre trying to keep the delicious smell going.4. I got the big one..... you‚Äôll need a stick or a long lighter to keep the big ones going once they reach the half way mark. I use a bamboo skewer.Bottom line, I‚Äôd buy again, but only for the bathroom and those bubble bath soaks."
5,3-Oct-18,1,Not the smell you expect or want.. I was overall really dispointed in this diffuser. It only lasted about a week and within that time it was nearly completely used up and what was left was just thrown away because of how bad the smell became. I would not buy this one.
5,5-Aug-19,5,"Love this scent! I was using the plug ins to scent my house but learned that they are toxic, so threw them all away.  A friend of mine always has a wonderful smell in his house so I asked him what he does.  He said he uses reed diffusers from Pottery Barn in the Ocean scent.  I went to the Pottery Barn website and found what he uses, but they are $45 plus shipping for one bottle.  I decided to check Amazon and ordered a bottle of the Reflection and Clarity reed diffuser.  It smells almost exactly the same as what my friend paid more than twice as much for.  I actually filled the bottle up half way and kept the rest of the oil to put in my electric mist diffusers.  You only need a teeny tiny drop or it is overpowering when mixed with the water and sprayed out.  Now my whole house smells clean and fresh.  I love it and just ordered two  more ... one for the basement and one for my upstairs bedroom.  The oil will last a. long time because I use such a small drop."
5,21-Aug-20,5,"Smells Amazing. Burns Clean. I have purchased these candles many times over. Stillness + Purity scent is my favourite. If you love florals, you will love this scent. It's a soft floral, not sweet or cloying. It's a very beautiful scent. It has an ethereal quality to it.The medium size works well in average size rooms and bathrooms, with a decent throw. Burns cleanly, no soot. As long as you allow the candle to burn to the edge each time you light it, there should be no clinging and it should melt down evenly as shown in the picture attached. Trim the wick right under the ""mushroom"" once it has cooled completely and there should not be too many, if any, black bits in the wax.The flame in the heavy frosted glass gives off a lovely glow. The scent has always been consistent with each purchase on separate occasions. They have always been packed very well and have never arrived damaged in any way. I will continue to purchase these candles. They are my go to and a staple. And for the quality, the price is a steal!"
5,27-Oct-20,3,"Inconsistent scent quality I own four of these candles. Two of them (peace & tranquility and balance & harmony) are very fragrant and can fill a room. The other two, which are both serenity & calm (lavender thyme) bought at the same time, have little to no scent at all. I'm wondering if it's a bad batch? The burn time on all of the candles is good. They seem to last as long as they say.Candle tip I recently learned - Make sure when you light it for the first time you let it burn long enough so that the wax melts all the way to the edge. Apparently candles have 'memory' and if you don't do this the next time you light it it will only burn as far out as when previously lit and then you end up with a bunch of unused wax."
5,21-Feb-20,5,"Strong, lasting fragrance Have gotten 3 more to give as gifts. Very strong beautiful feminine fragrance. Slow burning, long lasting. Fragrance still noticeable 3 hours post extinguish. Notable linger for 3 days just with candle in the room. Love this candle!! No smoking when lit. Not super bright. Low flame. More sour/tart and flower smell vs sickeningly sweet."
5,28-Mar-20,1,"Disappointed to say the least! A few things:One, for some odd reason the candle came in a Yankee candle box.  It‚Äôs not a Yankee CandleTwo, there was no visible wick.  There was no way to actually light the candle.Lastly, there was wax around the rim for f the jar.  Seemed as if it was homemade and not an actual Chesapeake Bay candle.With the shelter in place I‚Äôm going through my candles quickly.  Unfortunately I cannot buy them at my usual places so I was looking forward to receiving this one.Extremely disappointed ‚ò?Ô?è"
5,4-May-18,5,These are wonderful candles. I ordered peace and tranquility and balance ... These are wonderful candles. I ordered peace and tranquility and balance and harmony. I love them both they come in such an attractive container and they smell lovely.
5,15-May-19,5,"Beautiful scent that calms any person in the room This is the only candle I want to buy. This is my 2nd time purchasing and love the scent. It definitely provides you balance + harmony after a few minutes from lighting.I just feel so relaxed once it's lit. Playing video games, working, cooking. Basically, any activity you do, you get this sense of calmness and peace.Candle definitely lasts more than 40 hours which is decent for a small candle. And the candle holder itself is a pretty blue. Perfect house warming gift!"
5,16-Jan-20,5,"Includes essential oil - and it works great!  Some reeds are poor quality though Ordered this for a small 1/2 bath (powder room) off of our kitchen.  Room is roughly 4' x 7' and door is usually left cracked open.  Within 1 hour of filling it with the included oil (chose the lemongrass) and placing reeds in the jar, it filled the half-bath with a pleasant scent and even started to work its way onto the first floor of our condo.  It's not overpowering, and smells ""just right"".  If I had any complaint, it's that the quality of the reeds is hit or miss.  Out of roughly 10 or so reeds included, at least 2-3 were permanently bent.  If you're OCD or you're just looking for a uniform product to show of a classy room, you might look elsewhere.  Otherwise, they work as advertised and don't look too bad."
5,9-Jun-20,3,"Smell disappears This is a lovely candle, presentation is great. It smelled amazing at first but after the first burn the smell pretty much evaporated. It‚Äôs basically just a pretty non-scented candle now. I‚Äôm disappointed, I had high hopes and expectations for this candle and unfortunately they weren‚Äôt met."
5,18-Sep-20,1,"Horrible packaging caused damage to product. I originally bought these candles as a gift. I am very disappointed. When I first opened the box the scent of these candles was very lovely and I got excited, then I took out the first candle. It looked like someone with dirty hands has been handling it and the top which is wooden looks like it has been scraped on other wood. I crossed my fingers that the other looked like it could still be a gift but unfortunately it also had the same look as the first. They were packaged so poorly. There was no separation between the two candles so they must have been rubbing against each other. Now I have to find another gift for my family member. Ugh. They do smell really good though."
5,17-Feb-19,2,"Disappointed Candle was not very fragrant and burned way too quick for the money. I bought this to try out instead on White Barn‚Äôs Mahogany Teakwood and should have spent the few extra dollars to get what I knew was already good. I order stuff online a lot but very rarely, if ever, feel the need to write a review if I‚Äôm unsatisfied.  Just want to spare someone else who cares about spending more than $5-$10 on a candle and expects it to be good if they spend more than that.  Unfortunately disappointed."
5,25-Sep-20,5,"AMAZING smell with an extremely AWESOME value! From jump the name combination peeked my interest. All of could say was"" WOW"" when I read the scent name. All I could think was ""O.M.G."" when I smelled it. This candle's unique and clean smell has been complimented by several people so far. Beautifully done! Did I mention I burned my first one 3-4 hours the first 2 days and it looked as if it was untouched? Quality, Quality, Quality product! I just had to gift it to a friend for him to try; and my large order just came in. In love with this product!!"
5,23-Nov-17,4,I bought the simplicity and hope and like it. At first I felt that the smell ... I bought the simplicity and hope and like it. At first I felt that the smell was very light but was burning it in a large room. Then I put it in the bathroom and the smell was much stronger. It‚Äôs a very relaxing smell! Would recommend
5,7-Jun-18,5,"not like a fake scent or anything at all I use this candle in a large space where people work out and so it has a lot to cover up! It smells very fresh and organic, not like a fake scent or anything at all. It fills up the room with this refreshing smell very quickly."
5,19-Apr-17,5,"The scent was perfect: not overly strong with citrus undertones The scent was perfect: not overly strong with citrus undertones. Was clean & uplifting, my 1o year old daughter even commented, ""smell makes me smile."" I would agree.  There wasn't a waxy smell which I appreciated but there was a bit of floral I could have done without, but not enough to deter me from purchasing again.  That of course is all about preference & mine sways away from floral.  As the width is just over three inches you would want it to burn for at least 3 hours so that you don't get a ring of was that shrinks the diameter of the candle, it does state not to burn for more than 4 hours so it's within that time period."
5,20-Feb-20,5,Smells great! I previously bought the lavender one but decided to give this one a try as well. Was not let down at all. Burnt through Valentine's weekend and smelled incredible!
5,9-Mar-20,5,"Find your CHI at a great price I love this candle in my bathroom which I'm trying to make SPA like. I am going for a minimalistic look and serenity vibe. The color of the glass on this candle is perfect for that ,I have white, a very light green and a little bit of brown in the room and this product is PERFECT. The smell is lovely, kind of sweet and calming. As I recall, the price was one of the lowest. Can't beat that. I would recommend that you get this if you searching for serenity, serendipity and inner peace.  Or if you want a great candle for a great price lol"
5,13-Sep-19,1,"Still a good product This is a updated version of this product, this scent is a awakening for your morning: Sadly they arrived melted down just to one side of the holder and with NO wick?! Maybe the wick is there just underneath all that melted wax? I'm so bummed I hoping for a  tranquil evening and that's Not going to happen, so bummed! Never again, we've been noticing that there are a few products that should NOT go through the mail it's Not working out!"
5,30-Nov-17,5,"Classy candle with a MUCH more sophisticated fragrance than the usual dept store kitch Ordered this candle as a present but it had such good reviews I got one for me too. I am so glad I did!It is a very pretty candle and the scent is heavenly! I chose this one for a teenager who likes scented candles and I figured this one would not drive everyone out of the house, LOL! Not only is it not likely to bother anyone, I'm betting she will get some requests to use it. I bought the 'Peace and Tranquility' scented one and its a nice sort of earthy scent with a hint of Baby powder in there somehow. Not too fruity or heady just plain pleasant. This is a scent you will want in your home, elegant and unobtrusive.  Looks like I will be buying Chesapeake Candles again!"
5,29-Jul-20,5,"Fragrance Packs a Punch I was a true believer that Yankee was the best candles due to the intensity of the fragrance and longevity of the candles.  Well yankee candles move over cuz I have a new lover.  OMG...the fragrance is so intense that I couldn‚Äôt burn it for more than one hour.  The fragrance lingered in my bedroom for hours afterwards.  It burns very well, so it will last a long time, therefore priced very well.  I bought the grapefruit and look forward to trying more fragrances."
5,1-Sep-20,5,"Amazing scents! Will be ordering more in the future. These candles smell amazing!!!---I ordered 4 of these candles in different scents (and one in a bigger size because I had the one previously from a yankee candle shop at my local mall a few years ago...I've loved it the scent *sea salt & sage* ever since.)They all smell amazing and make my whole house smell great! (I got a large size sea salt & sage, and medium sizes of the lemongrass & eucalyptus, cranberry & dahlia *that one is a gift....smells great I should have ordered an extra for myself in that scent! Haha* & Mediterranean citrus)I'm a candle lover anyhow so I will be ordering more in the future. Shipping was quick and quality met my expectations."
5,25-Jan-20,3,"I can‚Äôt smell it in the room Beautiful packaging/ a nice accent to add on the table. The smell is clean from my perspective - My biggest problem is that it doesn‚Äôt smell up the room and my living room but does subtly smell my bathroom.If anyone knows a reed diffuser that actually smells up a living/dining room, please inform me. I‚Äôve only experienced it once with an old gold canyon reed diffuser and it smelled my entire apartment up. It was a gift and they no longer sell it and the search for a good one has been a challenge."
5,26-Sep-20,5,"Eucalyptus and Lemongrass So...bought this diffuser for our front bathroom. It came beautifully packaged, safe and secure.  Tonight while dusting, the diffuser was knocked off the counter, it hit the floor and was completely destroyed with oil everywhere.  So sad...BUT the bathroom smells AMAZING!!!  It was a pain in the butt to clean up, especially the oil and glass shards.  The diffuser vase is fairly thin glass.  I‚Äôve just ordered a replacement...what we will do with the next one is add those flat glass pebbles glass pebbles inside the container to make it more bottom heavy.  Learned a valuable lesson. ?üòÅ"
5,5-Feb-19,4,"Great scent, long-burning, pretty jars The Cranberry Dahlia ""Joy/laughter"" (purple) is my favorite candle at the moment. The sweet cranberry scent fills a room so easily and lightly. It's the best. The Cashmere Jasmine ""Peace/Tranquility"" (white) is a bit too faint for my taste. I like to clearly notice the scent when I enter a room and this did not put off much of a scent. Overall I like this line of candles and I'm excited to try the rest of the collection!"
5,15-Sep-17,5,Chesapeake Bay Candle Mind & Body... LOVE LOVE LOVE this candle! It smells so wonderful good & all our guests love it too! Blessings!
5,10-Jul-20,1,"Wackity wack wack Wanted something that smalls great and lasts longest to replace my candle habit. I‚Äôve purchased this brand of candles before and was pretty pleased, but...Smells like a nice fresh cologne when you put your nose right up to it, otherwise, I can‚Äôt smell it at all. Really, not at all. Not even a few feet away. Even dipped the other side of the reeds like the instructions recommended and waited a few days, and nothing. Def wouldn‚Äôt buy again, will return. This is my first diffuser, don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs just the one I received or all diffusers are this lame. Will probably just stick to candles."
5,31-Aug-20,1,"Don‚Äôt buy this!!! The reviews are misleading. I tried to contact the seller and got no response. So here is what I have to say. I would have given thisNO stars but.. that wasn‚Äôt an option.There was ABSOLUTELY no way to get to any wick. The candle smelled ok but was also tiny compared to the pictures. Don‚Äôt buy this. It looks pretty but it‚Äôs SUPER POOR QUALITY! And, if you need help for a melted no wick candle you won‚Äôt get it!"
5,22-Jul-20,5,Ahhh! Heavenly scent This remarkably non disappointing candle has sold me for the long haul. Such a beautiful aroma that really last and just makes you feel good smelling it. It‚Äôs a bit floral like as of course it does say water lily. OMG! What sucks is the price went up 10 bucks when I went to reorder it. High demand I guess. The clarity and reflection candle is yucky to me anyway. To much of a lemongrass burn to it. This candle is theee best I‚Äôve ever had! Awaiting two other fragrances. Worth every penny but 10 bucks more in les than s week is gouging to me. I‚Äôll buy it anyway
5,14-Nov-20,5,"The scent is amazing! I could've (and I did) just bought a candle from Walmart or any other such stores, but I was lazy and purchased it from amazon.  The scent is amazing, and once you lite it and the wax starts to melt the scent is immediate. It's good for large to medium sized rooms. The scent stays in the room for a while too, so that's a plus. I use it every other day or so, and I got to say it lasted me for a good couple of months. If you use it everyday i'm sure it won't last as long. 2 months tops maybe. This is a good purchase in my books."
5,15-Sep-19,1,"Where‚Äôs the scent ? Appealing to the eye but that‚Äôs about it. These candles have very minimal, if any scent.  I was burning two at a time and no one could smell anything. I usually buy these from TJ maxx and the scent is noticeable with just burning one. Not sure if I got a bad batch or what. I will not be repurchasing."
5,6-Nov-19,3,"One of the candles arrived broken.... be prepared to only get 2 or even 1 candle out of this order. They do not bother packaging it with more than one sheet of bubble wrap. The candles themselves smelled amazing which is why i was disappointed i could not use all of them. To make things worse, I was still going to try and use this candle that was broken but just put it in an old candle container to hold the melting wax. However, when i went to look at the candle on my windowsill, it had melted from the sun all over my window sill and onto my carpet. That part is probably my fault but could have been avoided if it didn't arrive broken."
5,8-Jan-19,4,"Small but great It smells so good!! Especially when I have this one lit along with my homesick pa candle. But the size is a lot smaller than I thought it would be which was a little disappointing. Maybe it‚Äôll last long tho so the size won‚Äôt matter. ?ü§??üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ?è Only time will tell, I do love it though! Just glad I used a gift card and not my own money to try it out haha"
5,12-May-19,5,"Love this candle! This candle is excellent and adorable. It's hard to order candles online that you've never smelled -- you're always rolling the dice on whether or not you'll like them. The Water Lily scent is lovely! It's fresh and slightly floral, but not overwhelming.For $10, the candle has lasted much longer than I anticipated. I've had it for about three months, burning it on the weekends for a few hours until my apartment smells nice.I am very pleased with this product and I will absolutely purchase it again."
5,17-Jan-20,2,SMELLS HORRIBLE I love this diffuser the look only it matches my decor but the scent of peace tranquility is the worst smell I have ever had and it literally stunk up my house in 15 minutes and you cannot return them. HOW THIS SCENT RECEIVED GOOD REVIEWS IS BEYOND ME. IT DRIPPED AND TOOK THE STAIN OFF MY TABLE. IM ANGRYI did order another one but only for the diffuser itself.
5,8-Sep-20,3,"Expensive regular candle This candle does not provide a lot of scent, also it is small for the price. But the most disappointing fact is how it is packed. I received a box almost ten times bigger than the candle which I do not consider environmentally friendly."
5,26-Mar-20,5,"A little smaller than expected.... But still a great candle Candles arrived a day ahead of schedule. Both were perfect once taken out of box. The scent is nice and can be smelled quiet a bit though its not over powering, they also are nice to look at while burning. I‚Äôve burned them every day since the arrived for at least a couple of hours on end . I think it‚Äôs far to say that the 5O hr burn time is pretty accurate.The only downside is I thought they would be a little bigger other than that I‚Äôm completely satisfied with my purchase."
5,6-Oct-20,5,"Light and airy I got the cashmere jasmine scent for my small office. I usually dip one end of the reeds then flip over so the tips have scent on them from the start. The scent has filled my office with a light cashmere scent, and is not overwhelming at all. My office is 12x12 ft. Multiple compliments on the serene fresh scent."
5,22-Jan-19,5,"Everything smells amazing. LOVE the cedar I‚Äôm officially hooked on these candles. I ordered 3 different scents (oak moss, tobacco cedar and sea Salt sage) and love all 3! For me personally, I‚Äôm obsessed with woody masculine scents, and the tobacco cedar (focus + patience) is my absolute favorite. Its very masculine though, so if thats not your thing I wouldn‚Äôt recommend it. The oak moss is also very woody/musky, but also sweet and floral. That one has a really nice balance if you‚Äôre looking for something a little brighter. The sea Salt sage one is very fresh, bright and perfumey. Reminds me of other ‚Äúocean‚Äù themed scents I‚Äôve had before. It‚Äôs a good choice if you want to freshen up your place. Can‚Äôt wait to try more!"
5,7-Sep-19,4,"Overall pleasant looking and smelling candle I bought this candle to add a calming scent to my home office where I study up to 12 hours a day. The smell is a very welcome addition to the space, and it's not an obnoxious color.The only reason I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 is because it tunnels regardless of how long you have it lit. That means to get the full candle's worth of wax I'll need to melt the remaining wax on a hot plate when this wick is done and drop in a new wick. A thicker wick makes candles burn faster, sure, but they also don't need to burn as long to give a lasting scent and you're not tempted to waste perfectly good wax.I will certainly be purchasing this candle again, and may just replace the wick with a thicker one right away next time."
5,30-Jan-19,5,"Beautiful and potent! Wow! I am in LOVE with the stillness + purity Reed diffuser! The smell is a combination of rose water and peonies. These scents are perfect together. As soon as I walk in the room I can smell this gem! And this is in a house that's been smoked in for 70 years and under renovation, and I can smell this right away. I'd love to put one in every room, but I cannot afford that! I will be buying this again in the future. Worth the money."
5,12-Nov-18,5,Obsessed!! I love candles & I am very picky about scents because I often get headaches if they are too strong. This candle is amazing! It‚Äôs a light smell of roses and I love it so so much. Will buy again & again!!!!
5,13-Jan-20,4,"Love it, but.. I absolutely love everything about this candle.  The Serenity + Calm scent is amazing.  But...  the self trimming wick doesn't work well at all.  The burnt section stays attached and won't come off,  this causes the candle to flicker very badly.  I have to put it out,  trim it anyhow and start up again.  I actually am fussing with it WAY more than a standard wick."
5,9-Nov-20,5,"Long Lasting & Smells Amazing! It's hard to describe what it smells like through text so I am going to go ahead and assume you smelled this candle before at a store like I did and then came to Amazon to try and buy it. Otherwise, it smells of cleanliness and almost like a really strong linen. I've lit the candle about 2 dozen times and it's not even half way yet. Granted I only leave it on for half an hour but that's still impressive for a small candle. Very impressed!"
5,11-Jan-20,5,"Wonderful smelling candle I purchased this candle for myself, although it would be a great gift to give to someone.  The smell is just divine, not too strong, but does have a great scent.  Has a nice throw to it.  Nice lasting candle.  Arrived quickly and in perfect condition.  I read the other reviews before purchasing, and they were spot on.  Would happily repurchase from this seller again!"
5,1-Mar-19,3,It‚Äôs okay if you like powerdery smells I just ran out of an awesome rose candle I had gotten awhile ago and decided to give this new one a go. I bought this thinking it would smell more like roses then it does. It‚Äôs got what I would only describe as a powdery scent vs the true floral I was looking for. It has beautiful packaging and I‚Äôll likely use it here and there but will likely not purchase again.
5,7-Apr-19,1,"No smell. Arrived in pristine condition. Looks great when set up.Only problem, the smell exists only when you pick it up and bring it close to your nose.I put it in a small bathroom, so it not like too much space and the smell doesn't go around. Simply useless.$3.99 gel bids from Target worked better."
5,10-Apr-20,1,"Let down. The glass is a rich beautiful teal color and the wax is soft and creamy. The scent was soft and fresh, not lit. The problem with the candle is that you can only smell it when you‚Äôre standing right next to it. I had it lit for 2 hours in my super small kitchen, and I forgot it was actually lit until I set my coffee next to it. I will keep it in the closet Incase we loose power being that it is almost a swntless candle."
5,4-Jan-19,5,"Can't place it but got to have it! New favorite smell is the Joy & Laughter.  I bought it put in my office at home while I did my schooling, a little motivation while I work and I love it! I am not a candle person, I have a few, some were gifts, but I never use them.  It's not floral or a candy smell but it is sweet.I like it so much I bought the Balance & Harmony. My boyfriend likes that one much more than me. It's a floral, linen smell. It's nice.I plan on buying a bigger one of the Joy & Laughter."
5,5-Aug-20,4,More Floral than Pear I have used different kinds of candles for years now so I have discovered that I personally prefer more fruity fresh candles over floral or sweet.I enjoyed this candle in a larger room as opposed to a small bedroom. The overwhelming floral fragrances fills a small room while the fruity pear can be subtly detected in a larger room.I enjoyed burning this candle in the living room of my boyfriends place with his other male roommates! It definitely lifted the room and created a bright summers day feeling but this is not a candle that I would purchase in this fragrance specifically again.If you enjoyed reading this review I also love sharing EMPTY products I have already usedon my Youtube channel  DashBarks.
5,31-Jan-20,3,"Ok candle .. not so good scent this candle came well packaged ( it did come in a box that had large letters wrote on it - yankee candle thou - (?) The glass is frothy an very nice eye candle . Nice to give as a gift . BUT, the scent of the candle does not smell at all but just a little hint of lavender. Before I lite the candle the lavender smell was great an not overwhelming smelled good !! When I lite it thou it just smelled like a burnt candle. I have purchased tons of different brands of candles. If you want a candle that your going to want your money worth then ‚Äú one fur all‚Äù candles !!! These candles ARE SAVE IN ALL WAY POSSIBLE !!! These candles are very well worth the price an smell so good an in a very pretty glass !!!! I gave this candle a 3 stars cause it is very pretty but the smell is not good at all"
5,23-Feb-20,4,Great Candle This has become one of my favorite candles. I like to think of myself as a small candle snob. I have tried almost every popular brand out there and I keep coming back to this one and another one from bath and body works. The smell is very pretty while burning and not overwhelming. It burns nicely. I love the 3 wick because I feel it puts off a little more scent. I burn them in my bedroom nightly and I just love to relax to the wonderful smell.
5,7-Aug-18,5,Great smell and good burn time Loved the candle was on sale for 14.99 so was def with the value in my opinion and was very presentable candle for any surrounding. The smell is not over powering by any means nor has a potent smells highly recommend trying if you haven‚Äôt it was my first time and will get again.
5,3-Nov-20,2,"Doesn't have strong enough scent I was excited about this candle but was super disappointed when I received and burned it. It has the faintest barely-there scent. I expected a much stronger scent to fill up a room, but unless you are right on top of it, you can't smell a thing. I will put it on my office desk so I can smell it a bit, but it was for my kitchen area to make the room smell nice. It doesn't work for any kind of room area."
5,12-Nov-20,5,Perfection! Lasted forever! This candle lasted forever. I loved the scent and I felt like it was able to burn for literally 2 weeks and I kept it lit ALL THE TIME. Definitely worth every cent.  Beautiful frosted glass - white - and I will reorder again & again and again!
5,11-Aug-18,5,"Really excellent candle! Wow I love this brand! I wasn't sure when I bought it, but I'm sold. I bought the ""Peace + Tranquility"" scent. It's perfect - really attractive glass jar, gentle burn and soothing smell. I've been burning it for a few hours each day and it's barely gone down at all, I can tell it will last a while. I'll definitely be ordering more in the future. This is a perfect coffee table candle or a gift."
5,17-Jun-20,1,"Overpriced You can get similar candles from the corner store for the same price.  Sorry, not satisfied for the price and scent.  ."
5,21-Nov-18,5,Natural soothing scent Was hesitant to buy candles without smelling. I was looking for something that smells  natural and not so much like chemicals. This lavender and thyme candle  is great in the bathroom and I will already gotten other scents from this company.
5,24-Jan-20,2,"No Joy from Yankee Candles I don't seem to have any luck with Yankee Candles or the subsidiaries, i.e., Chesapeake Bay Candles.  I've tried their tea lights and now their large pillar candles and keep encountering the same problems; weak scent, weak throw.  Don't know if it's due to old stock sold by Amazon or poor manufacturing/quality control by Yankee Candle.  Even when Yankee Candles are discounted/on sale, there are better value/quality scented candle options."
5,8-Jul-20,5,Smells great I'm extremely picky with my candles and this has made it to my list of favorites! I don't really get a mango smell but more of a subtle grapefruit with other soft elements. It has a great throw and I can smell it in other parts of the house when my room door is open. This candle also burns nicely so you get your bang for your buck.
5,30-Jan-20,5,"Smells so nice I love this, it's just what I was hoping for when I ordered. A nice soft scent, not overpowering but very pleasant. I put it in my downstairs powder room so I can smell it when I come in the house. A nice powdery scent. I can't comment on longevity because I've only had it a month, but that's already better than other air fresheners and I expect it to last several more months."
5,24-Jul-19,5,"Love the smell This was a gift from my fianc?©. He always gets me the best stuff and this was no exception. I absolutely loved the design, scent and how long it burned for. Hopefully I get to try a few more scents. I use it while in the tub. The wooden lid is secure and insures no water or debris get into the candle when not in use. It also works to preserve the scent. This is a great candle!"
5,23-Dec-18,5,Smells amazing!!! I bought this candle for my friend who is a mother and loves wine and relaxing in the bath. This candle smells amazing (I‚Äôm sure it could put me to sleep) and came in a beautiful glass jar. Will definitely buy this again! But next time for myself!
5,1-Mar-20,3,"Wish I bought more Harmony. Nothing against the candle (confidence). It was a functioning candle. It just reminded me more of teens with axe? Maybe that's too much? Maybe it was too strong? A few randoms gave it a meh reaction, but I'm sure one of y'all will love this candle and think I'm wrong. To you, yes you! This candle was made for you!To compliment this review, check out Harmony. That scent is everything you want until it's gone. Then you wish the other candle was also Harmony."
5,28-Jan-18,4,"Enjoyable fragrance This is the first candle I have purchased from this company. So far, I like the product, and I like this fragrance, Joy and Laughter."
5,2-Aug-19,1,"Disappointed, no scent I was excited to get these candles because most of the reviews were great. I was so disappointed, no scent at all. I even had two in one room and I could barely smell them. Only if I got really close. I bought a cheap one from the grocery store and it was way better than these."
5,14-Jun-20,3,"Not enough scent! Im sad by this because the scent is beautiful but you literally have to stand directly over it to smell it.It has been long lasting and once I combined with other candles,  then my house smelt fabulous!I would buy again because it's not fragrant enough.."
5,10-May-20,4,"Diffuser smells good. Candles NO SMELL at all! I like the scent! It‚Äôs Subtle. It makes the room smell good. 1 DIFFUSER is just right for a small room like a bedroom. The MEDIUM SIZE CANDLE doesn‚Äôt smell at all. I only have a small open space living room and kitchen and I can only smell the diffuser in the kitchen where I had the diffuser.It would‚Äôve been nice if it will scent my whole downstairs room. I will buy 2 more just to make sure, my living space is scented well."
5,9-Feb-20,4,Sent wrong candle-updated I haven‚Äôt even lite this candle yet in all honesty but don‚Äôt you get a little chapped when you order one thing and receive another?Updated- I bought the candle I wanted again and did receive the correct one this time. Brand did not make any attempt to correct their first mistake. I will say however both candles do smell nice. I will buy again dispute the mistake.Updated rating from 3 to 4 star based on smell of both candles.
5,30-Jan-18,1,"I am so disappointed.: ( From all the reviews I had high hopes for this fragrant candle. I was even OK with it if the smell was a bit overpowering as someone stated. Unfortunately, my candle doesn't smell hardly at all. I can only smell the scent if my face is directly next to it. How long does it need to burn before I can truly smell it? I am so disappointed. :("
5,30-Apr-17,5,"Two Thumbs Up! Great candle! I had bought the large balance and harmony candle, and it came wrapped carefully and intact. The smell is amazing, light, fruity (almost like pear and peach), and floral (rose and a hint of violet). What I love about this candle is that it lasts longer than other candles that I have owned previously. Once, I left it on for about 8 hours, and was surprised to see how only a small amount of wax had been vaporized (of course this experience may vary depending on the person). I would definitely recommend!"
5,14-Jul-19,1,No smell Even after burning all day these don‚Äôt even make a small bathroom smell nice. They have almost no scent at all. I burned both in the same room and it only smelled if you put your face right over the candle. Horribly disappointing.
5,17-Aug-20,1,"Disappointed I usually am very pleased with Chesapeake Bay candles, until I bought this one they were among the best, but this one was a big disappointment. After letting it burn in a very small room with the door closed for over an hour, I couldn't smell anything when I walked in the room.  Tired of spending money on candles that smell good before you light them but give you nothing after you light them."
5,26-Nov-19,1,"Functions more as a Paperweight/Unscented Candle The only function this candle has is that of a paperweight. I purchased this specific scent because the reviews all mentioned that the scent was great and long lasting. However, from the moment I lit the candle I have not been able to smell the candle at all. Not even when I'm sitting merely two feet away from this candle. I'm extremely disappointed given the fact that this candle and candle company had high reviews. Do Not Buy This Product. Save your money and just by an unscented candle instead."
5,11-Jul-19,2,Pretty disappointed I like the scent but it's very mild. The throw is weak at best. I can burn it for hours and barely smell it. Very disappointed! Was looking forward to the notes that were described in this scent but I struggled to smell them unless you literally smell it up close while it's not burning. I'm surprised these candles are so popular.
5,20-Nov-19,5,"LOVE it. Great scent I was hesitant to order a candle online (without smelling it first). But I am SO happy I did. Not only is this a 3 wick candle that burns evenly, but the smell is AMAZING! I forgot that I have lit it, then was walking around wondering what the hell smelled so good---it was the Rose Water Candle!!!! LOVE IT."
5,21-Mar-20,5,"Good Gift ; First delivery lacked wick; Replaced quickly w/o return This is a gift that I gave to someone dear at Christmas; she had to come back from overseas due to Covid-19 pandemic in order to complete grad semester.  I purchased this candle because she said she likes it, and I wanted her to have something that reminds her of the former normalcy of our lives.  My recent candle arrived without a wick but  was quickly replaced without need of returning the wickless candle.  I am grateful for that.  Two thumbs up!"
5,1-Mar-18,5,"Great Candle For Men I am not a huge scented candle guy, but I do like using candles in the winter to give my place a warmer feel (look up the Norwegian idea/principle of koselig).  That said, the confidence + freedom candle smells amazing.  Not too strong or fake smelling.  I would highly recommend this to any guy looking for an appropriately scented candle.  I will definitely be buying more soon."
5,9-Jan-19,5,"Great candle! I love candles but hate spending a fortune on them. For $9.99 or more, this candle is a great value. Excellent burn time - about 40 hours. The smell is great without being too overwhelming. I'm about to order a few more for the rest of the house!"
5,8-Nov-17,5,"Highly recommended Fabulous scent, modern looking, easy to assemble, would recommend"
5,5-Jul-20,3,"Why is the scent virtually not there? It's as if these candles were exposed to heat or something and the scent oils faded away. I've bought this candle in stores and the smell is WAY STRONGER. These weren't cheap... Anything odor related i'll have to buy in stores from now on. I've had this issue with candles, wax melts, cologne/perfume...This is just my personal experience of course."
5,27-Aug-19,5,"Great candle, great price, fast and Free shipping. Happy customer! This was my first purchase of these candles, and am totally happy. The grapefruit/mango smelled just like the fruit, and filled the room. I meant to get 2 different kinds but messed up and got 2 of same, which is ok. Use to get Yankee candles, but they seem to have less scent  now, yet still pricey. Looks like I've crossed over. Hoping they do Fall and Christmas scents!"
5,27-May-20,2,"Smells great but beware broken products Bought a 2 set of these candles.  One the glass was broken in several pieces,  even though it was wrapped very securely and safely.  I was really surprised.  The other I am burning, and it smells lovely.  I am not bothering with shipping it back, as it is in several sharp pieces.  I did see in other reviews that others have received broken glass, so buyer beware."
5,7-Oct-20,5,Smell I like it. Smells good. Could last longer tho. I light It twice for an hour and a half and it‚Äôs already more than half way done. I will buy again because I love the way it smells.
5,25-Jul-19,1,Not Great I have had this in my living room for over a month now and have flipped the reeds several times. The scent does not diffuse from the oil inside. If I pick it up and open the top to flip the reeds I can smell the lavender but otherwise it is just an ornament on the fireplace mantel.
5,28-Sep-20,5,"Love! I ordered Confidence & Freedom and Stillness & Purity, and I am so happy with both scents. The candles themselves are very pretty too. Descriptions of the scents are accurate, and when burnt, it‚Äôs the perfect amount of scent. Some overwhelming scents both me and these are perfect! All around very happy with my candles! Will be trying out more scents from this brand soon."
5,6-Feb-17,4,"Nice, but no refills for a scent that doesn't last as long as hoped This is exactly what I needed. The product looks nice, smells heavenly (peace + tranquility), but this review will be four stars because the scent doesn't last as long as described (1-ish month vs the estimated 3 months) and there are no refills (as far as I'm aware) that are available."
5,22-Jan-18,5,"This candle smells so good, and also burns super slow This candle smells so good, and also burns super slow. I fell asleep with it burning for 8 hours and it barely even went down. It definitely makes you feel relax and well balance. The smell is so relaxing and you feel the positive vibes in your living area or wherever you place this candle. GREAT PURCHASE!!!"
5,13-Sep-19,3,Doesn‚Äôt smell the same. The first time I‚Äôve purchased joy and laughter candle the smell was amazing I smoke cranberries etc ..  this is my second purchase and I have yet to smell anything I even left my candle burning and went into another room came back 15 minutes later and still nothing maybe I just got a bad batch
5,27-Aug-20,2,Very light scent I did not know that Chesapeake Bay was a Yankee Candle or I would not have purchased.  The scent is faint and you have to sit right next to the candle to barely smell it.  I had recently purchased 3 candles from Yankee and a car freshener and only one candle gives off any scent (did not purchase on amazon - purchased on Yankee site).  I am shocked because Yankee is usually the best.  Very disappointing.
5,8-May-18,4,"Just right Not too strong, but not too light.  Very good smell."
5,7-May-20,2,"Doesn't diffuse the scent I have two active kitties and I needed something to replace my candles. But despite the good reviews i noticed that the scent doesn't disperse. It only smells when I pour the liquid into to the holder, but It did nothing to refreshen up my room. I went back to lighting candles and the diffuser lives in my bathroom just as a deco."
5,13-Apr-17,5,"I absolutely love the aroma this candle gives off I absolutely love the aroma this candle gives off! It isn't overpowering, but it still a noticeable fresh smell. I love that it has beautiful glass container, and I don't have to tuck it away when I'm not using it. It seems to be of great quality as I have been using it for a couple weeks now and it seems I have many uses left!"
5,19-Nov-17,5,"Smells great, lasts a long time. This candle smells absolutely amazing! I have burnt it for hours and not much of the wax is gone. They say scent can help you relax and this is so true with the smell of this candle . I have put it in the bathroom during a bath and it truly helped me relax and unwind before bedtime. I also have burnes this in the living room and the smell radiates throughout the living room, kitchen and hallway. The scent is not too strong but just enough for you to feel relaxed. Chesapeake bay candles are the best and last for a long time. I plan on ordering more to give as gifts this holiday season."
5,18-May-20,5,"Noticeable scent When I got this candle there was a little divot in the wax, so if it was a gift I would not have gifted it.  But it was for me and I've been using it.  Very nice scent that you can actually smell, easy to light wick that doesn't get overwhelmed with melting wax.  I am happy with this purchase and would buy again."
5,30-Jul-20,1,"Disappointed I did not experience any of the selling points that I read about from the item description or reviews.  I barely smelled these unless I was literally within a few feet and the longevity was completely wrong, the liquid was empty after 2 weeks ( maybe a little less actually )  I won't be buying diffusers ever again.  This was a risk buy as I've never had them before.  I'm sticking with other methods like incense, candles, plug ins and wick less warmer options."
5,3-Nov-20,5,Balance + Harmony is great! Such a nice scent! I got the medium sized Balance + Harmony (8.8oz) and it has lasted a long while and burned evenly. Make sure to let it burn at least an hour each time and always turn it off by covering the candle with the lid. Keeps my bedroom smelling great and it looks cool with the frosted jar also. Would make a great gift for the upcoming Christmas season.
5,29-Oct-20,5,"So happy we purchased I bought the Chesapeake Bay  Balance +Harmony candles.  I purchased 3 and gave two away as gifts.  Everyone loved the light, calming fragrance and the pretty sea green glass candle container.  It's pretty enough to leave out when not burning.  I will absolutely purchase again and probably try other scents as well."
5,10-Dec-18,5,"Not too perfumey This candle last a pretty long time. The scent is quite soft and calming. When you walk into the room the fragrance doesn't slap you in the face. It almost catches you by surprise. After you're in the room for a minute or 2 you think ""ooh, it smells nice in here"". I love it and will order another when this one runs out."
5,30-Dec-17,3,The jar and accompanying lid is beautiful but the smell was too far on the soap/chemical ... The jar and accompanying lid is beautiful but the smell was too far on the soap/chemical side for me. Smelled a bit like cheap hair conditioner. Ended up giving it away to someone who did like the scent very much. The takeaway: scents are subjective but this candle is clearly well made. :)

5,7-Jun-19,5,"Smell is incredible! Love it. The smell is incredible. Love it. I use it in a small powder room and the whole bathroom smells fantastic. I‚Äôve had it for a month or so and the liquid has gone down about an inch. Really wish I could buy replacement liquid. Looks very nice, much better than any other scent product I‚Äôve used. Definitely appropriate to give as a gift."
5,25-Mar-20,3,"Very light scent, almost unnoticeable I bought the serenity + calm scent (lavender & thyme). It has a nice smell but the scent is SO light. It takes forever for me to smell it after it‚Äôs lit. I wish the scent was at least twice as strong. At first I thought the candle was just plain wax with no scent at all. The glass the candle comes in is really nice though."
5,20-Dec-19,1,Disappointed My candle presentation was horrible. There was candle wax all over the lid (inside and out). The print on the outside of the candle was off centered and crooked. There was pieces of wax all over the place. The candle inside had cracks!I was very disappointed because this was something I was trying to gift someone
5,4-Jan-18,5,"Excellent scent and burn life This is the most lovely scent of pear I've smelled. The burning is slow and lasts a long time. I have only had the pleasure of buying 2 for myself, but have gifted these often."
5,12-Jun-19,5,"The best candles for me I am so often disappointed with my candle purchases. These are the best ones I've bought in probably 10 years. Seems like I always get ripped off, BUT these really impressed me. I will keep buying these bc I'm so happy with the strength of the scent, not too strong that you choke but it definitely keeps an even scent until the end of burning."
5,12-Aug-20,5,"Confidence + Freedom Candle = aftershave scent The 'confidence + freedom oak moss amber' candle smells like male cologne/aftershave.I bought this as a gift for my friend. I think a more floral scent would have been better but thats ok. Some people have mentioned the candle exploding near the end of its life. If that happens, I plan to change my review, but, for now, I am pleased with the product!I also hope that the jar won't be ruined by the end since its a cute container that can be reused."
5,7-Sep-20,2,"Scent Where? I ordered a few candles from this brand, one of which was the citrus. I was super excited to get these candles and try them out throughout the house. I had gotten the large size of that specific candle because I wanted it for the living room. Lit it the first time and let it burn for about an hour, but my partner and I couldn‚Äôt smell anything unless we got really close to it. We thought maybe the space we had it is was too big so we tried it in our guest bathroom, lighting it again today and letting it burn for longer, but there was still no scent. The smaller candle we bought was way more fragrant that the large candle. Maybe the one I have is defective. Not sure but really disappointed in it."
5,30-Aug-20,2,"Mild smell. Smaller than average. Burns clean. Item came nicely packaged in a nice box. It‚Äôs made by yankee candle company which was a pleasant surprise. It was much smaller than I thought. However, you can tell it‚Äôs a quality candle. It burned clean but the smell was ok and not as strong as some of my other candles. For the price you can find better options."
5,28-Jun-19,5,"Clean scent I really liked this candle because it gave off an aroma you could definitely distinguish but it was crispy clean not that heavy overwhelming fake fruit smell that almost every other candle I've ever ordered had, despite them all being described as something wonderful and completely different. This one was honestly different"
5,21-Oct-20,5,"Gentle strong scent, long durability, beautiful look! It smells incredible! Not to mention, the other day I lit it in my bathroom, and totally forgot about it for a couple of hours. Found it still burning, and freaked out that I wasted the life of the candle- expecting it to be practically gone. But nope, all of the wax is still at the top. Maybe just half an inch lower. I love candles that have a scent strong enough you can smell outside of the room it‚Äôs in (with door open of course), but not overly strong to be a headache, and that has a long life span. And this candle is really great for exactly that."
5,20-Mar-20,1,Unusable after an hour or so I recognized the name and that was all. I lit the candle and it burned a quarter size hole through the center until the wick couldn't get any more O2 then went out and became useless. Left with plenty of candle but I can't use it. Took about an hour or so for that to happen. In the trash it went.
5,5-Nov-20,5,Smells amazing! Bought this for a Christmas gift exchange. Product came packaged in box with cardboard shell wrapped around candle.. the product arrived intact with no defects. Smells amazing unlit and would probably smell even better after lighting. This is a good sized candle that will have plenty of longevity! Great price for the product. I would buy this product again in the future!
5,22-May-19,3,Very strong scent Packaged very well and is very nice looking.  I found the scent much too strong.  It gave me headaches and I had to give it away.  But it was a pleasant scent....just way too intense for me.
5,13-Apr-20,2,No Scent At All The first thing I did when I received this candle is take the lid off and took a big sniff.  There was barely anything.  So I thought when I lit it I would get something.  Nope.  There was only the smell of wax burning.  No scent.  There is nothing refreshing or rejuvenating about this candle.
5,9-Jan-20,5,"Very impressed. I'm a Dude, I don't care about candles. I got two of these candles on a whim for my Wife for Christmas. She's been burning this one in particular in our bedroom, and it really smells amazing. Some candles, I've found, don't really seem to do much, but this candle is very potent, and enjoyable."
5,1-Apr-19,3,"Very pretty. Not strong. I got the Pear scented teal candle. Meh. Smells nice in the jar but when you light it, the pear smell is just kind of off. Plus it wasn't a strong smell. Couldn't tell a candle was lit when I was on the other side of the room. It's a very pretty looking jar though. Maybe a different scent is for me."
5,27-Feb-20,4,"Scent is not overpowering Candles smell wonderful and I love the color of the votives, they burn evenly and the scent is not too overpowering.  Only complaint is the way they're packaged and shipped - the set of two candles was wrapped together in bubble wrap and shipped in a box.  There is no protective layer of bubble wrap on each candle, just bubble wrap to hold the set together.  During shipment, the two glass jars rub against each other leaving marks and scratches all over the votives making these ungiftable.  If I wasn't in desperate need of a candle right now, I would have sent them back but decided to just live with it this time around."
5,3-Oct-19,4,"Elegant look, great scent. This scent is perfect for a bathroom or laundry room - really fresh and clean. I love the color and the frosted glass. Only problem is that the oil seems to evaporate much more quickly than other oils I've used, even with fewer sticks. I may try another oil after this bottle runs out."
5,25-Jan-20,1,Where's the scent? I searched for a strong scented candle. This has no smell at all. Maybe they forgot to add fragrance?Very dissapointed. Package well. It wasn't broken. Huge letdown because of no scent. I bought another one at the same time. Maybe it will produce a scent.Update. I have used the other candle and it has no scent either.
5,28-Oct-20,5,One of the best candles I‚Äôve ever owned! One of the nicest scented candles I‚Äôve ever had! The scent is strong enough to actually smell from a distance and it‚Äôs such a soothing and natural scent. Burn time is great and it seems to be lasting just as long as one of my bigger candles. I‚Äôll definitely be ordering more from this company!
5,9-Oct-20,5,"Pretty for room accents I bought the short and the tall matching candles and have them on my mantle.  Very pretty outside - make the whole display!  I haven't burned them because they are too nice simply decorating my living room.  That said, I have another one that we have been burning.  Smells very good!"
5,8-Feb-20,1,Sorely Disappointed I have purchased many candles. Expensive and non expensive and all of them burn better than this candle. I burned it for 4 hours straight and I never smelled anything unless I put my nose to it. I'm so mad I didnt just get it from target!
5,26-Aug-18,5,Love the smell I bought this because I live in the area of the Chesapeake. This candle smells amazing! It's not an overwhelming scent and the smell travels through the house nicely.
5,9-May-18,5,"Candle wax burns very evenly, and has a lovely ... Candle wax burns very evenly, and has a lovely scent that fills my room. It's peaceful and soothing. The brushed glass jar is lovely."
5,17-Dec-18,1,Not impressed!!! I have been a candle burner for years! I give this a complete thumbs down! A Cheerful giver candles have been the best candles all around!  Even over Yankee.  Chesapeake Bay had no scent.
5,28-Sep-20,5,Lovely Scent Very nice candle with scent that cover bad odors but doesn't overpower the room. Just what I was looking for. I will be purchasing more of these.
5,22-Jan-19,1,the smell there is no sent to this candle and I had bubbles in it I hated both of the candles they had absolutely no scent at all. Then to top that off there were bubbles in the wax therefore I was not getting my full purchase of the candle so I complained to Amazon and they fulfilled my satisfaction and took it off my bill. Thank God I would never give these as a gift I would be embarrassed only because I am candle obsessed and everybody knows and my family as well as my friends that they always get a five star hotel type candle from me every year
5,17-Jun-18,5,"Happy with Purchase Arrived well-protected in bubble wrap, and intact. I was a little leery ordering a scented candle that I couldn't smell first, but it has a very pleasant and light scent."
5,9-Nov-19,5,"LOVE THIS CANDLE First time buyer from Chesapeake Bay Candles and I am in LOVE. the smell is subtle, but strong enough that people comment how much they love it! Actually had people write the info down to go home and order one. It also seems to last longer than other brands I have purchased!"
5,23-Mar-20,5,"Great smell, long-lasting These are my favorite candles. They last a long time and the pleasant smell is very noticeable‚Äîmore so than other candles (even more expensive candles.) They seem to last a long time as well. The lid is a nice touch and is good for storing the candle when you‚Äôre not using it."
5,9-Mar-20,4,"Awesome scented candles, could burn a little longer The scents were good, it could have lasted a little bit longer but those candles seem to burn fast not only those candles even the cheap candles burn faster so I prefer spending a little bit more money and getting a bit more quality than quantity I mentioned some of them on a YouTube channel that I had purchased them and they smelled really good just so you know thank you will be doing business in the future I‚Äôm sure"
5,10-Sep-19,5,"Smells amazing! While I agree that some of the scents dont smell much, I LOVE the cranberry dahlia one. It definitely gives off a pleasant aroma. I smelt some of these in a store but they were way overpriced so I ordered here. I also love the water lily pear one, that will be my next scent purchase!"
5,2-Sep-17,4,"Not bad at all. Smell good, last pretty long."
5,30-Mar-20,1,"Not sure who I'm let down by... Amazon or Yankee Candle? I ordered the reflection & clarity scent and just received the candle no less than two hours ago, but had to write my review. I'm not sure if Amazon sources these candles from Yankee Candle or Chesapeake Bay or however that works, but this candle has ABSOLUTELY NO THROW. This is why I stopped ordering candles from Yankee Candle years ago and only go through local vendors or Bath & Body Works. The candle has been burning and I can't smell it two feet in front of me... Really disappointed especially because with everyone's WFH situation in place for the next month+, I was hoping to have some fresh scents to burn through the day. Displeased."
5,15-Apr-20,1,"Get something else. This one is faulty. This candle has a manufacturing issue. My original candle came perfectly packaged, box in perfect condition but the wax shook loose from the jar and the wick was stuck inside. The replacement I received had the same issue. The fragrance is okay but it‚Äôs not worth it."
5,15-Jan-19,5,Great for guys I was weary on the smell before purchasing.... I'm a single 28 yr old male and wanted my apartment to smell the part. This smell is pretty masculine yet refreshing. I recommend it to any guys trying to make their house smell great. Girls really dig it too!
5,27-Aug-20,5,"I love the sent so much I bought it twice to sent as a gift! The candles are only about 5 inches tall and 3-4 inches in diameter so in my opinion they are costly. However, they smell great. I gifted some to a friend. They are wrapped really well. I just wish they came more quickly and were less expensive. I still think they are worth it, I just wish they were more worth it."
5,11-Apr-20,3,"Smells great but... You can‚Äôt really smell the fragrance unless you‚Äôre right on top of it.  It‚Äôs not diffusing throughout the room.  I keep flipping the sticks upside down, but still not helping.  Maybe I‚Äôll try a putting it in a different room.  It smells good, but what‚Äôs the point if it doesn‚Äôt disperse the frangrance?"
5,26-Oct-20,1,Do not buy. Really disappointed in this candle. The wax is only melting around the wick and that‚Äôs it. Then it goes out because there is too much wax around the flame. Would not buy again. And I‚Äôm very upset that I spent this much on a candle that won‚Äôt even burn for 30 minutes.
5,23-Feb-19,3,Disappointed.  Very subtle scent. I ordered this because I was looking for a lively rosemary/patchouli scent.  This candle was suggested and the description hit all the marks I was looking for.  I lit it and waited and waited to smell it filter through the room.  This never happened.  It‚Äôs a very light scent and was disappointing to me for the price.  Wish I could get a refund.
5,20-Jan-20,1,Has no scent. Can‚Äôt smell this candle at all. I‚Äôve had it burning in a small bedroom for about five hours and it has the ever so slightest scent. Definitely not what you would expect from a sage and lavender candle. Won‚Äôt be buying again and I hope you don‚Äôt get scammed like me.
5,18-Feb-20,5,"Whatever you do, GET THE PINEAPPLE COCONUT ‚ô° Okkkkk for some reason I thought the pineapple coconut was going to be my least favorite out of the 3 (I also bought rose water and lavender thyme) and it turned out to be my favorite. It smells soooo yummy and the other two I bought are really good too. I just bought 2 more pineapple coconut, one for my mom and another one for when I run out of my first one. This is the most affordable good candle I've found yet."
5,24-Jul-20,1,Save your money! Paying for the nice jar and wood top. Can‚Äôt even smell the scent. Wish I wouldn‚Äôt have bought two. I know Yankee candles smell great and thought because these are made by Yankee they would too. I am also surprised at all the good reviews I read that prompted me to buy them.
5,20-Sep-20,1,"Smells SO bad I look desperately for a Nice Smelling candle, I wanted to scent my room either Lavender or Rose and went with Lavender. However this Lavender Thyme candle smells SOOOO Bad. Its not even funny. The whole time its burning the whole room stinks of 99% Thyme and other herbs and 0% Lavender. It stunk so bad and I was so disappointed."
5,7-Apr-20,3,"light scent I expected a more powerful pineapple scent and it isn't there.  It's a pretty candle, but not strong enough."
5,29-Apr-20,2,Not strong enough for a large room Product description says this is designed for a large room I found that to be not true it is making some sans says especially when new however it‚Äôs really weak in a medium size living room with high ceilings you don‚Äôt even notice is there he does not do any good a little tree the one that you hang on the mirror in your car makes way better coverage smell and he lasts much longer don‚Äôt bother
5,2-Jan-18,5,Love this scent so much I bought two Love this scent so much I bought two.  I will continue to buy soft scents like these.  Candle is great and safe.
5,22-Oct-20,5,Smells good! I‚Äôm the type of person that has candles lit all day long and this candle has been lasting me. I have it in my living room (which is a pretty large space) and the scent fills up the whole room. It doesn‚Äôt have an overwhelming smell either (which I love) and I‚Äôll definitely be purchasing this again.
5,2-Sep-18,5,Happy with my purchase! I don't know which fragrance I like better!  These candles smell wonderful in a smaller room ... bedroom.  I'll be ordering more.
5,29-Sep-20,3,"Smells nice, but don't put the lid on This candle is beautiful and smells fantastic. BUT, like most candles, you can put the lid on to put the fires out, but not this one. When I removed the cap, one of the wicks came out, one was invisible buried in wax. Not what I would have expected from a Yankee Candle"
5,10-Nov-20,5,"Refreshing, calming The mediterranean citrus has such a nice refreshing smell! Not too strong, not too subtle. It‚Äôs just right for me. I love to light it in the morning for a nice crisp smell. I bought the medium size but I will likely purchase the bigger one once this one runs out!"
5,5-Oct-20,2,Doesn't have scent I ordered this because of all the good reviews. However my candle has NO SCENT. At all. Very disappointed
5,19-Nov-19,4,"Very calming scent! Honestly, I expected this candle to last a little longer than it did, but the smell was fantastic and the candle itself has such a nice, clean look. I'm not sure that I would purchase it again, because of the cost, but I don't regret my initial purchase."
5,4-Apr-17,5,"One of the best! One of the best candles. The scent is so clean and bright. Fills a small space, like a bathroom well. Packaging is beautiful! Very pleased."
5,16-Aug-17,5,"I can't get over HOW AMAZING this candle smells I can't get over HOW AMAZING this candle smells!! I'm a candle connoisseur and this is the one for me! The fragrance is subtle and not overwhelming to the senses, and truly takes over the room.  It's calming and reminiscent of a spa:) HIGHLY RECOMMEND."
5,23-Mar-20,3,"Peace & Tranquility Peace and Tranquility smells like diapers, and that isn't a euphemism. I'm still giving this a three because I love Chesapeake Bay Candles. They last forever, they're good quality and the scents are usually* very light and natural. This one just wasn't for me."
5,6-Sep-20,5,Second time buying Love this candle. This is the second time I bought it. It was out of stock for a while and I missed it so much I'm going to buy another asap for backup lol. Just a nice..peaceful..clean type of scent. When my toddler is asleep I light it and just enjoy my 5 mins lol
5,28-Dec-19,5,"Amazing!!! I ordered this candle as a gift for my Aunt.  Delivered today, and am ordering another one today for myself!  The smell is incredible!  I ordered Balance and Harmony.  I don‚Äôt know how else to describe it, except as heavenly!  I can‚Äôt speak to the longevity of it, but with 3 wicks, I‚Äôm sure it will last a while.  And if it doesn‚Äôt, who cares?!"
5,17-Oct-20,5,Best of all time candle hands down I have PTSD and I burn one of these most of the day and it helps me...... my wife loves them as well and after the candle is done you can clean it out make your own soy candle with the candle jars you have already..... my favorite candle of all time.
5,28-Sep-20,1,"Disappointed in Peace and Tranquility I tried the Peace and Tranquility scent after loving Balance and Harmony...very disappointed. I found Peace and Tranquility literally smells like a bar of non-graded white soap. I LOVED the Balance and Harmony scent and its throw in my large bedroom was incredible, so I'll be sticking with that for now."
5,7-Mar-19,5,Basil Mint scent Basil Mint is my absolute favorite candle scent. It is a clean fresh relaxing scent that permeates the room nicely.  Some of the scenes in this collection I find ‚Äúperfumey‚Äù.  Not this one!  It‚Äôs my go to on an almost daily basis.  FWIW my 2nd favorite is vanilla sea salt.
5,4-Apr-20,1,Overrated and scentless The refresh + rejuvenate Looks classy but I could not smell a thing.  Tried a candle from bath and body works and another from glade and those worked fine.  Maybe it was just the particular scent I purchased but I am not satisfied with this purchase.
5,7-Feb-20,1,"It‚Äôs just ok you know like eh Didn‚Äôt like the scent at all, it was extremely overpowering , but if you like the smell it lasts a long time in the air"
5,9-Sep-20,1,No good Do not pay so much money for a simple candle which is damaged at the top ... wow what a disappointment
5,19-Sep-20,3,"Beautiful and good scent but wick was faulty Halfway through burning this candle, the wick disintegrated and it couldn‚Äôt be lit anymore. Tried to dig out around the wick to get down to a ‚Äúgood‚Äù section of wick, but there wasn‚Äôt any. Past the return window, so I may not buy this brand again."
5,7-Apr-17,5,"The scent is good - kind of warm Purchased the Focus + Patience diffuser set. The scent is good - kind of warm, spicy and manly. The packaging describes it as ""Tobacco Cedar,"" but I don't get a strong tobacco smell.Very attractive frosted grey bottle."
5,6-Mar-18,5,Five Stars Wonderful candles!
5,27-Aug-19,5,Quality Candles When I first purchased this candle I thought it was a little bit pricey but then when I used it on my gosh it lasted forever and then I went and purchased more different sense each one smells exactly as it is described I will continue to purchase from this company .
5,17-Aug-20,5,"Refresh & Rejuvinate Scent - Guy Review I bought this for the wife... I was in the dog house (said many stupid things). It does not have a strong smell, but she likes it. I'd rather smell something strong like cinnamon, hot sauce, or motor oil. I bought it because she was mad at me, but she didn't hurt me, so I think she liked it. She lit it and put it in the bathroom... I'm still trying to figure out how to read between the lines. She still looks mad."
5,11-May-19,4,"Balance and Harmony candle. Smells good. Fragrance is pleasing to me. Soft, not overwhelming. Everybody's preference is different. The scent covers the whole room. Candle flame burns down the center and does not melt the wax along the sides of jar. When flame nears bottom of wick there will be a lot of wasted candle wax."
5,26-Aug-20,5,"Lovely candle! Great candle! Has a pretty light lavender/clean smell to it. Not at all overpowering like some fragrances, would be suitable for most people's preferences. The longevity of this candle is crazy, I've left it on for hours and barely made a dent."
5,22-Nov-20,5,Best candle for the price! For the price probably the best candle on the market. They all smell great and last a long time.
5,22-Aug-18,5,"smells good and not to strong. My, my this smells good. I was burning it last night. Nice size and it arrived through the mail in perfect condition."
5,1-Apr-20,5,Wonderful scent I was extremely excited to receive this. The scent is so smooth and calming. Surprisingly the candles scet can fill a quite a large area too!
5,16-Dec-18,5,"Smells amazeballs. This candle is orgasmic! I love it so much. I am gifting it to my grandpa's girlfriend for Christmas... But I am so tempted to keep it for myself. LOL Thank you for making an excellent candle! Packaging was nice too, was wrapped in bubble wrap, and then placed in it's own box. Great for gifting, too!"
5,2-May-20,1,"Product arrived broken I first smelled this item in a co worker's office. I loved it! She told me she ordered from Amazon so I finally ordered it and it came broken. This is the first time I have ordered anything from Amazon and it wasn't perfect. And not that it's Amazon's fault. The packaging was very poorly done. The fragrance is wonderful and I will be creative and use it in another container, but I sure was disappointed when I opened the box and the glass container was in pieces. So that is why I gave this product only one star."
5,14-Jan-20,3,Not impressed Overall I‚Äôm not impressed..I was expecting this candle to be amazing due to the high reviews but this candle is nothing special. Unless you are 5 ft from the candle you can‚Äôt even tell it is lite.I've had it lite for half a day and would have no clue you had a candle lite in the house
5,8-Nov-20,3,"Not bad It's a pleasant scent, though a very faint one. And this thing is burning fast. I've burned it maybe two hours and it's already 1/4 of the way gone.  Note that this is a Yankee candle product. I didn't realize until I saw the packaging."
5,16-Aug-20,4,Very calm and robust smell The combination of lavender and thyme might just be one of my top ten favorite smells. It is indeed relaxing but also somewhat fresh and better to unwind with than the formaldehyde alternatives. The only downfall to this candle is that it did not last as long as I was hoping for. It lasted an adequate amount of time but I would have loved to enjoy this scent longer.
5,23-Jan-18,5,"Great scent! Incredible scent.  Has three wicks which really delivers a tremendous amount of scent when lit.  Perfect fragrance, not overwhelming."
5,12-Nov-18,3,"Got it as a gift for gf I thought it was cute, smells nice, but really small and doesn‚Äôt burn long for the price your paying. I thought it looked bigger in the picture was kinda dissapointed in the value"
5,18-Sep-19,1,don't waste your money product is small and not what everyone who reviews it to be.  This product does not offer a good scent and gives everyone who smells it a headache.  Family as well as friends say the containers look pretty but the candle is unbearable to smell.  do not buy.
5,8-Jan-19,3,"Pretty, but the scent gave me a headache The scented oil it came with made me almost nauseous, too caustic and strong for me. It took 2 days to get rid of the scent in the house. I washed the vase thoroughly then used some vegetable oil with a little bit of lavender essential oil instead. It matches my bathroom though and it's pretty."
5,15-May-19,5,"1ST TIME CANDLE USERS & CANDLE LOVERS- GET IT! I can‚Äôt begin to describe how incredible this scent it. It literally lifts my soul up into the air and then gently puts me back into my body. Do you know what fresh linen smells like? Combine that smell with fabric softener, white flowers that look like they have a small but don‚Äôt, and some love and wala, you have this candle. I would 100% recommend this to anyone looking for a candle that actually emits a strong luscious scent. Love it."
5,5-Jun-19,5,Amazing candle Highly recommend this the scents are not too overwhelming and more natural smelling. Very soothing as well for stressful evenings.
5,24-Apr-17,5,So peaceful and beautiful I love the smell of the Water Lily Pear candle. The scent is a pleasant flower scent that is real light and not overbearing. It creates a peaceful ambiance in our home. The look of the candle fits perfectly in any room. I will definitely be buying Chesapeake Bay candles again.
5,3-Jul-19,4,Thumbs up Only reason I gave this product 4 stars is because it didn‚Äôt travel well during mailing. The candle became detached from the holder part. It was still pretty and smelled great and giftable so I didn‚Äôt feel like I needed a refund. Mother in law loved it as a gift for Mother‚Äôs Day.
5,21-Jan-20,2,Disappointed I received a bad candle. The wick of this candle doesn't allow for the wax to burn properly. It is tilted sideways make the wick too close to the wax. Because of this the wax is only burning in the center of the candle. I can barely smell the candle because of this or maybe the scent has bad throw all together.
5,17-Nov-20,2,"Smells nice, but doesn‚Äôt burn properly I really love the scent of this candle but am disappointed in the way it is burning. It is burning a rather small flame and only the wax in the very middle is melting. The wax on the outer edges isn‚Äôt even warm or soft. It also came in a protective package that was made for a different brand/size candle that was too big, so the candle was banging around in the box and the lid had come off of it when I opened it. This seems like it would be a great gift but I‚Äôd be worried about gifting a candle that didn‚Äôt burn properly."
5,2-Apr-19,5,"Smells great. Lasts long. I got this for myself and gave the second candle to my mom to help her feel at peace during a recuperation after hospitalization. I have since purchased the two-pack twice more. I burn these candles whenever I'm at home, and I still love the light and tranquil scent as much as I did the first time I experienced it. Great gift for yourself or others."
5,15-Apr-20,5,"Best scented candle I've ever tried One of the best scented candles I've ever used and still my current favorite even after trying multiple. This is probably my 2nd or 3rd purchase of this same product (from store and online) and this is the best scent. It's really suddle, mellow, romantic and relaxing."
5,1-May-18,5,Five Stars Awesome candle. Smells like a quality cologne.
5,11-May-20,5,"Pleasantly surprised :) (FYI: I'm talking about the peace + tranquility candle)This was the first candle that I bought online. I am really sensitive to smell so I was really worried that this candle might be too strong or just not a good scent. I was pleasantly surprised to see that the candle was just strong enough to clear up the air in my room, but also not overwhelming to the point that my head hurt. The packaging is simple and aesthetic. To put the scent in simple terms, it kinda smells like light vanilla and it helps me relax.DEFINITELY recommend this candle :D"
5,18-Apr-20,5,"The best! As soon as my state issued stay-at-home orders, I rushed to order some calming candles.  These are ideal. The scent is subtle, but effective and they last longer than expected.  I just reordered another set of the calming lavender and thyme.  Thank you for an excellent product."
5,8-Feb-18,4,"To start off this is a beautiful looking candle To start off this is a beautiful looking candle. The glass  reminds me of the stuff you would find on the beach that has been smoothed by the ocean waves and sand, and lets the light through beautifully. I took one star off because the wick is very difficult to trim, it does not break off cleanly with your finger like with other candles i have used so I would suggest a wick trimmer if you buy this candle. This was a nice scent."
5,23-Apr-20,4,Nice candle I like the candle but thought it would be larger when I ordered it.  Lovely jar and cover and the scent is light and not totally overpowering.  Burn even so far and no issues.  Burns quite fast.  Already used and in the garbage.
5,21-Dec-17,5,Great These candles are so refreshing. And was packed very well. Also arrived on time. I was so happy I turned around and ordered 2 large ones. They wasnt as large as I thought but still good.Thanks.
5,9-Aug-19,5,"Beautiful, Crisp, & Refreshing! This candle may very well be the best candle purchase I've ever made! The scent is refreshing and clean, but not overwhelming. I love candles, but this one has definitely overexceeeded my expectations. Well done, Chesapeake Bay! I'll be ordering this beautiful treat, again!!"
5,7-Nov-20,5,Smells Amazing!! Smells AMAZINGGGG! You basically don‚Äôt even have to light it to get a nice scent to the room. I left it on the counter with the top off and even that was nice. Then lighting it gives the full affect and it‚Äôs smells great!
5,25-May-19,1,"Very weak scent and a little small for the price. IMHO?üòê I didn't like this candle, the scent is so minimal you can barely notice it, and it only lasted about 20 hours ...  I like candles that smell a little stronger and last a little longer. So I went to Walmart and got a Yankee candle for $18 and the scent is a lot stronger and the jar is so much bigger."
5,30-Jun-20,5,"Perfect diffuser to buy! Incredible scent, carries throughout my home. Very soothing and pleasant. Lingers perfectly, not overpowering. A small amount goes along way. Best part is the scent liquid comes in a separate bottle you can store. This allows for you to only use as much as you want, when you want. Since you really don't need allot it goes a long way. Great quality sticks, real wood."
5,23-Oct-20,3,Weak scent and poor longevity Weak scent and doesn‚Äôt last..half the candle was gone in a few hours of use.
5,21-Jan-20,3,"Eh Not going to lie i was expecting more based on this product's rating.  Not really any scent, i use my candle as a bathroom pairing and for random lighting for rooms.  This doesn't really omit a scent, will be purchasing a candle with a better scent.  Good design and build attempt.  Like the wood top."
5,5-Jul-19,5,"So far it's perfect I bought it for our master bathroom. It makes our bathroom, closet, and bedroom all smell great. We keep our bedroom door shut to keep the dogs off the carpet and the instant we open our bedroom door we are greeted with this great scent."
5,16-Feb-19,5,"Smells good. Burns evenly. Looks pretty. I hate products that use buzzwords like ‚Äújoy and laughter‚Äù as their product‚Äôs name, but this candle smells great and looks great sitting on the table."
5,25-Oct-18,3,"Quick Burner The candle design itself is aesthetically pleasing, with a wooden top and nice graphic lettering. However, this particular scent is not too strong, I can barely tell I have a candle going and it seems to burn rather quickly. I recall it saying something along the lines of 50 hours of burn time but mine is almost halfway done and I would not say Ive used it for more than 10 hours."
5,18-Dec-18,3,Nice but it doesn‚Äôt smell like Christmas.... I like that this item looks nice...  all I wanted really was a Christmas candle that smelled great....  what I got was a very nice jar that has a sophisticated look and a new age smell that may appeal to millions.  But I‚Äôm a Minion who wants to sing ?üéµ It‚Äôs Begining to Smell like Christmas and it don‚Äôt.
5,9-Jan-19,5,"Great gift ideas I got two, one for my husband and one for my son, for Christmas. Nice quality glass jar. Lovely smell, not too flowery, which is what I wanted. I was tired of everyone taking my candles, so this year they got their own! Lol! They worked out great as extra Christmas gifts! I‚Äôd buy again. Hopefully they‚Äôll have more scents available next time. Good price for two candles as well!"
5,29-Jun-19,5,LOVE the scent I found this scent originally at Target but it seems they no longer carry the scent.  Found at same price (or better really) on Amazon.  Scent reminds me of a spa smell.  Not too strong but very pleasant.  3rd time purchased this particular scent.  Target had same brand in a salt and water or water and sand or something along those names....also a nice scent.
5,14-May-20,5,Definitely recommend I bought this at a spontaneous and random moment... but this is one of the best things I‚Äôve gotten from Amazon. By far my new favorite candles. The only ones I use. Definitely recommend. You won‚Äôt regret. My favorite is the white one; such a soothing scent.
5,26-Dec-19,2,"Disappointed. I was honestly really excited to try this candle. I'd heard a lot of really good things about it and was ready to have my own awesome experience. However, I was really disappointed when I tried it out myself. The smell was so faint I almost didn't know it was burning unless I was within 5 feet of it. And it burns up so much faster than I expected. My personal opinion is that the smell is too faint and it goes too fast, but it may be someone else's idea of the perfect candle. All in All, I won't be buying this brand again."
5,7-Dec-19,3,Nice scent 1 of the 2 candles arrived broken inside. Amazon was kind enough to refund me half the cost. Scent is nice. More citrusy than i wanted. Was hoping for a stronger basil scent. But its nice. It would make a nice gift
5,5-Mar-20,5,"Bought it twice! Love it This candle smells amazing! And it‚Äôs appearance is really pretty too with the wooden lid and frosted glass. Had to buy another one because my boyfriend kept the first one I ordered because he liked it so much. I‚Äôll definitely be buying a replacement anyways once mine runs out. Would make a really nice gift, too!"
5,7-May-20,1,"money wasted. I was so excited to receive this, as I had ordered it a while back, but sadly it came broken. I tried to do a return on the item so i could exchange it for a new one and Amazon says it is not aloud. A good amount of money wasted."
5,14-Jan-20,5,Great size for bathroom Because this is made by Yankee candle the smell is definitely noticeable. This is a perfect size for my bathroom as it is not too tall or wide. I have absolutely no idea what sea salt and sage is supposed to smell like. But this candle does smell fresh and clean without being too perfume.
5,21-Jun-19,3,"Beautiful scent, however not soy (I'm guessing) The scent is lovely, though a little strong for a small room. Meanwhile, I suspect it's not actually soy. I am very, very sensitive to candle burning, it hurts my throat, and soy candles are the only ones that won't hurt my throat. This one begins to hurt my throat after about 20 minutes of burning. If you are sensitive to things like that, I recommend something different."
5,12-May-20,1,"I wish I could give this candle ZERO stars (but I can't)... This candle deserves ZERO stars because it arrived defective. It had no scent, no longevity and it's not very giftable unless you're a person who enjoys giving your friends and loved ones defective garbage to return.I returned this item amidst the pandemic several weeks ago and have yet to receive a refund. What a nightmare purchase and the absolute opposite of the relaxing experience I was hoping for when I purchased this SERENITY + CALM themed candle. Ironic but far from enjoyable."
5,2-Sep-18,5,This love and passion candle was phenomenal This love and passion candle was phenomenal. We loved the scent and it burned really well. The scent was pungent and filled several rooms without being too overwhelming.
5,2-Jun-20,1,"I'd give no stars if I could I received this candle yesterday and it had NO scent.  Now, I'm not suffering from some strange inability to smell things or anything like that.  It literally had no scent.  I looked under the cap and it said the candle was made 05/25/19.  That's over a year ago!  No wonder it sucks.  Sent it back."
5,3-Apr-20,5,Wonderful fragrance! I lived on Chesapeake Bay and this took me right back there! Brought the Maryland coast to Alabama!
5,23-Sep-19,2,"Noticeable marks/scratches on each candle - would not gift I was very excited to receive these affordable candles after all the positive reviews. They arrived today double boxed and packed tightly so it was definitely a shock to see that all three candles had marks/scratches that cannot be removed (I tried wiping them off with a paper towel and water, fearing using something tougher would just make it worse). Because these are just for myself, I can't decide if I should send them back given the great price point and the fact that I'm tempted to light them as they smell incredible.I plan to reach out to customer service to what type of response I get."
5,16-May-20,5,Great smelling and long burning. Great purchase. This candle smells amazing. The scent isn‚Äôt too strong and is as described. I‚Äôm going to purchase another one because it burns so well and the longevity of it is also good. It would make a great gift. I get so many compliments on the smell of the room.
5,6-Nov-19,3,"smells nice, but not strong enough i really like the scent of these candles, however the scent isn't strong enough for me to rate them highly.  i much prefer my bath and body works candles, even if they're more expensive.  they are okay for the price, but i wouldn't strongly recommend them."
5,19-May-19,5,"What a great smelling surprise I definitely enjoy scented candles however I have never bought any on Amazon, I took a chance after I researched a few sellers. I totally love this purchase and i truly recommend these candles or ones you may find in the collection from this seller."
5,30-May-20,3,"Nice smell, poor packaging This came apart in transit and I had a terrible time getting the wick back into it. It was in 3 pieces - jar, wax, wick and the jar looked beat up. Smelled amazing though. I think a simple piece of cardboard, tape, or something would have held it in place if placed in the top."
5,14-Aug-18,2,"Zero scent The candle looks great aesthetically, but it has no scent really. I ordered the Confidence + Freedom candle, and even with 3 wicks lit, there is virtually no scent coming from the candle. Unless you purchase candles for looks, I would not buy this."
5,31-Jan-19,5,I love this candle I‚Äôve been trying a bunch of different soy candles and this is by far my favorite and for the best price ordering more for sure. The wax is thick and burns slow and my whole house smells like water lily. I also love the jar it‚Äôs in!
5,31-Oct-18,3,"Good quality glass/top - No Discernible Scent Love the quality of the containers and tops that Chesapeake Bay uses for their candles; and I enjoy most of their candles' scents - for the exception of this one, which, at least to me, has no scent to it - and its used in a fairly enclosed/small space. I will continue to buy from this brand, but will not buy another of this particular scent."
5,1-Feb-20,4,"Great smell, aesthetically pleasing The smell of these candles was pleasantly strong and did a great job of giving a fresh scent to the whole house. I would appreciate a longer burning time, but for the strength of the scent and ease of use, I would definitely buy again."
5,1-Aug-20,5,Another great product from Chesapeake Bay I didn't even pour 1/3 bottle of oil into the diffuser and the smell was very strong for a decent sized living room.  I'm so impressed with the potency and longevity that I'm buying another 2 bottles already.
5,3-Dec-19,5,Delightful scent that is not overpowering This is by far my favorite scent from this line. It is sweet and floral without being over powering. The color also adds a pretty hue as the candle burns lower. Even without lighting the candle the scent is vaguely enjoyable.
5,19-Aug-20,1,"No throw No problem with seller. Received earlier than expected.  I am very disappointed in this candle though. I had high hopes based on other reviews.  However, there is absolutely no throw whatsoever. Can barely smell it even when you put your nose close to the burning candle.  Don‚Äôt waste your money."
5,17-Oct-20,5,"This is a lovely lavender long burning candle! I purchased the large lavender candle, scent is very realistic and so calming. I burn this before bed and it is so calming! Burns evenly and I feel I‚Äôll get many hours out of this. Highly recommend!"
5,20-Sep-18,5,"This scent is perfection! Absolutely IN LOVE with this candle and scent! The smell of it so nice that I went through my first two candles rather quickly, but they do last. Love them so much I just ordered the large one! Highly recommend."
5,6-Jun-19,5,"Smells great nicely packaged, and when I setup in the corner of the living room on a bookshelf, the scent reached the whole living room and this is the first thing I smell when I enter the apartment now."
5,6-Mar-20,4,"A+ on burn life.  Solid C- on scent. These candles are true to their estimate burn life of 70 hours, perhaps even longer.  They are low soot if you trim the wick and give a pleasant luminescence.  The scented aspect of these candles can be debated.  While they are indeed scented, the scent fades significantly during their ~70 hour life.  This is likely the nature or soy candles and the trade-off for the lasting burn time of the candle.  I will likely repurchase bit may not use exclusively for scented candles"
5,21-Mar-20,1,"don't like the smell.  like old laundry detergent or dryer sheets i was so hoping to like this, given the number of orders etc.  I had it out a few days and sadly just poured it down the drain.  ugh.  i just hope the smell goes away fast.  sad i wasted my money."
5,20-Oct-20,3,"The wax melted funny I would normally give 5 stars on this candle! Cause I have bought this candle before. The scent is amazing.. but, for some reason.. it was burning then just went out.. come to find out the wax melted funny causing the wick to drop into the center of the candle and now it won‚Äôt burn.. we tried to cutting some of the wax out tried melting the wax on top.. hint all the black, to get to the wick.. but it didn‚Äôt work.. so now we have more than 60% of a candle we can not use ?üòí  so unfortunately this one was a bad buy!"
5,2-Mar-19,5,"Speedy Delivery Shopping for candles can be hit or miss. This one is a hit. It has an amazing clean smell that fills the room. Given that, it put me in a state of total serenity every time I use it. Before I made my selection, I knew nothing about this brand or fragrance. I suppose this is one of the best on the market. I‚Äôm very particular on what I buy. I‚Äôm big on quality! This candle is a quality candle that can be used any time of the day. I need to order more, & happy to do so. This is a keeper!"
5,12-Dec-19,5,"Lovely scent I love buying these candles in target, but they're usually so much more expensive. I was geeked when I found a coffee table sized one - that I never see in stores - for a dope price. Pleasantly surprised and definitely happy"
5,13-Jan-20,5,Don‚Äôt last long Scents are nice. Candles themselves could last longer.
5,4-May-17,5,"Better then Yankee for half the price I'm a Yankee Candle junkie, typically spending $150 a month or more to make my house smell good on a daily basis. I wanted a cheaper alternative, something that would have a great scent. This candle fits the bill. It's a clean scent, not overwhelming, and faintly fills my first floor (not all Yankee candles do that). I can get 3 of these for what it costs me for one Yankee candle (incl shipping, mine is free with Prime). Granted this candle is smaller then a large Yankee one but it's still less money!"
5,13-Jun-20,3,Just OK I purchased Confidence + Freedom (Oak Moss Amber) (Medium size). It was just OK. Very light scent which may be perfect for some people.
5,23-Aug-20,5,"Love cashmere jasmine First one came in with shattered glass, but once I got my replacement I love this. The smell is really great. It smells clean and fresh but still somehow warm. I will continue to buy this scent for sure. I really like the diffusers because I don‚Äôt have to worry about candles and it always smells good. It‚Äôs lasting a long time. I‚Äôve had it for about a month already and I expect it‚Äôll last a couple more."
5,13-Mar-20,5,Great candle This candle has a fantastic scent and exceptional longevity. It's easily been lit for several weekends while cleaning up the house. The scent is easy on the nostrils and not overpowering. If you enjoy candles or know someone who does this is a great purchase.
5,8-Jul-20,5,Amazing fragrance that lasts One of the best reed diffusers I‚Äôve used. Yankee candle does not disappoint with this line. This scent is amazing: clean and invigorating. The reed diffuser has a lasting fragrance. I will buy it again.
5,10-Oct-20,3,Disappointed This candle was much larger than expected and not very fragrant.  It also came in a huge box labeled Yankee Candle. Not practical for shipping and not what I expected.  It will be returned.
5,5-Oct-20,5,PLEASE DO URSELF A FAVOR AND BUY AMAZING SMELL!!Please do yourself a favor and BUY THIS CANDLEI‚Äôm sensitive to smells and this doesn‚Äôt affect me. Yet it‚Äôs smells amazing. Such a great thing to have in the house or gift
5,12-Apr-19,3,Very strong scent Part of why I bought this candle was the claim that the scent was essential oils. I am scent sensitive and this is very important to me. I think the scent is very perfumy. It smells artificial and very strong. It is a beautiful candle but I can‚Äôt stand the smell.
5,16-Nov-20,5,"Love the scent, love the way it was shipped I was gifted a small version of this candle, and I just had to buy a big one. The scent is amazing. I'm not sure how healthy it is, couldn't find the ingredients or the type of fragrances used, but I have such a soft spot for this one...I was very pleased to find it snugly protected by eco-friendly packaging, instead of plastic! Very good choice, Yankee Candle, thanks for your effort to minimize waste!"
5,13-Dec-19,5,Definitely buy I usually buy dwhome candles -  but saw these on Amazon .. Love LoveI purchased 3 of them.  They're very light - had one n the bathroom the other night and the scent traveled into the living room ?üòÑ
5,23-Sep-20,3,Disappointed Nice container but doesn‚Äôt emit much fragrance.
5,4-Apr-19,5,"Long lasting, great smelling candle! Absolutely loved this candle! I bought it for my office at work and got so many compliments from my coworkers. The candle isn‚Äôt too perfumey and has a light springtime like smell! I burned it just about every day for about 4 hours and lasted about a month. I will definitely be buying this again."
5,20-Sep-18,5,Smells good with wide variety of scents. Smells good I like the glass and wood lid. Just what I needed.
5,30-Mar-20,5,"Joy and Laughter (Cranberry dahlia) is the best Great scented candles.  The Joy and Laughter (Cranberry dahlia) is the best one of the series so far.  Not tooooo strong of a scent but just right.  Sweet nice smell, lasts like it says, but of course, you wish they lasted longer.  No mess or black smoke - nice and clean.  Highly recommend."
5,28-Aug-20,2,CANNOT RELIGHT IT AFTER AN HOUR. I never write product reviews but this bothered me A LOT. Can‚Äôt relight it. It‚Äôs too narrow. Trying to rescue the wick but I don‚Äôt think it will work. I used this for a couple hours and it‚Äôs near impossible to re-light. Can‚Äôt smell it even!!! Very upsetting. Will never order again.
5,20-Sep-20,2,Doesn't live up to it's standards This candle has a wonderful scent for both men and women. However the throw isn't what I expected from this company. They are actually an offshoot from the Yankee Candle company.  Probably won't order again. It also doesn't burn evenly.
5,12-Oct-20,5,Buy again! Oh my god! This candle is really great at smell and longevity. I personally like this citrusy smell. Perfect amount of smell and great relaxing smell when its lit. Feels like I am in a spa.
5,25-Oct-19,5,Great candles Bought this candle along with another for my mother and I had to order more for her. She absolutely loved it. She loved them because they would help her sleep better. Definitely plan on buying more.
5,8-Jun-20,1,There was no candle I received a candle that didn‚Äôt actually have a candle inside.... so yeah... what‚Äôs fun is amazon actually wants me to return it haha so they will be paying to receive and empty candle! Haha
5,6-Sep-20,5,"Love it! Love this candle! I love the smell of roses and had been looking for a candle like this for awhile. It smells beautiful! Wish I could find perfume I could wear that smelled like it, lol."
5,4-Jan-20,5,Great scent and pretty decent size It smells so good!! I love burning this candle for a bath or when I‚Äôve had a long day.The scent is subtle but not too soft. It leaves my home smelling great for a while after blowing it out.
5,21-Jun-20,5,"Made for small spaces... I love the scent of this candle, but it does not last long. My way to get the best out of it is to place it in my bedroom and close the door that way the scent takes over the whole space but in my living room or anywhere else bigger than a room you are not able to smell it. Other than that I will be a great gift for sure and I most definitely will buy it again."
5,14-May-20,2,"Very very faint smell The smell is very very faint and it takes a very long time. I don't know why if Yankee has a good reputation. I really wanted to like this candle but unfortunately, I will not be buying it again. Buy yourself a different brand."
5,28-Jan-18,5,"Best candle! I absolutely love this candle! I want to get different colors and sizes to match our new living room theme. It smells amazing, and it‚Äôs pretty with the glazed colored glass and wood top."
5,4-Sep-18,5,"favorite brand of candle favorite brand of candle, only ones i will purchase now. they look sleek and come in really pretty colors that are a great accent to any room. scents are sharp and strong without being overly unnatural or overpowering."
5,20-Jul-20,5,"Great look, long last and variety of scents to choose from I am very pleased with the look of the candle, the variety of scents and options for sizes. I used the ‚Äòstillness and purity‚Äô one so fast I loved it so much! Not a huge fan of ‚Äòrefresh & rejuvenate‚Äô and waiting on one more to try out. Would absolutely recommend this brand and will be trying as many scents I can to find my favorite, so far it‚Äôs stillness and purity!"
5,10-Aug-20,1,Gives off no scent-grandma rose. Barely gives off any scent even if the candle is lighted for over an hour. Also the scent smells like a grandma rose. Better off sticking with the rosewater and ivy from bath&body works.
5,27-Sep-20,1,"Possibly Toxic, Look Carefully at Ingredients It says this is made of a soy wax blend. So, what are the ingredients of the ""blend""? It could be anything, including paraffin. Deceptive advertising, and I don't appreciate it."
5,27-Jul-20,2,"Yawn. Just a weak scent, burned quick, not good value"
5,28-Dec-19,4,"Not quite as expected; great scent Great smell, very very well packaged. Was surprised to see it was from Yankee Candle. I expected it to be a little bigger from the picture, but it was actually quite petite. Still a pretty good price for the quality and brand though"
5,7-Mar-18,5,Five Stars Love it
5,26-Oct-20,4,Nice smell This candle has good scent and come is good size and the price was decent l. I purchased is during amazon prime day deal so I got it at a good price. It can be a good gift for others
5,4-Feb-20,5,"A refreshing change The candle has 3 wicks, so it burns a little faster than other candles, but it gives off a terrific Eucalyptus smell. It's a nice blend, a great change of pace at the office."
5,4-Apr-20,5,Great price for the size! I love how clean and nice the scent is. It reminds me of the scent we had in our home on Kent Island Maryland. I love how the simplest things or scents can remind you of home and that‚Äôs what this candle does for me.
5,20-Jan-20,1,"lasted one ""burn"" and wick drowned in wax although scent was not perfect, ( it was way too sweet), I could still see why people would enjoy it.  I would not buy again.  That is not the main issue... I am vvvvery disappointed because the Wik drowned in wax.. the wax did not melt evenly and as a result it created a small puddle and kept going deeper and deeper , so the outer layers stayed unaffected by the flame. Basically, IT DOES NOT WORK ANYMORE."
5,10-Jan-20,4,"Great scent! Must ship with care! Love this light, relaxing scent! It‚Äôs not overwhelming, and it provides a great sensory experience. The container that it comes in is glass so it must be shipped with care. My first order arrived with glass shattered in the box, falling all over the place; however, after calling amazon they sent a replacement quickly. I‚Äôm glad they did....this scent is definitely worth it!"
5,26-Apr-20,5,I'm going to keep up with this beautiful aroma therapy for as long as this is in stock. As a stroke and cancer recovery woman. This candle changed my apartment environment to a spa oasis that allowed me to have a wonderful healing meditational experience and to awaken from a good rest to the fresh scent will help you imagine that you are actually visiting the Eucalyptus forest in Australia. Beautiful.
5,1-Mar-20,3,Subtle scent and elegant package I liked the package in which the candle was in. Very elegant and calming looks and it fits in very well in my space. I was very so so about the scent. Not bad but too subtle for my tastes.
5,21-Feb-20,5,"Delicious, strong scent. Would recommend! This candle smells beautiful! Made for a great Valentine's Day gift. Unfortunately it just burns very quickly with 3 wicks, so we're already almost halfway done!"
5,8-Jan-20,5,"Amazing smell, not overpowering, and affordable. I love this candle! I can‚Äôt handle strong scent. This isn‚Äôt strong at all. It‚Äôs perfect, not to strong and has a nice clean smell. It also last awhile after blowing it out. It‚Äôs a good price as well!"
5,15-Oct-20,5,New fave Great scent that last long and smells great!
5,8-Mar-19,5,Wonderful fragrance Bought this for my mother-in-law who lives in an assisted living facility. She was not allowed to have a plug-in air freshener. Her room smells wonderful without being too perfumee. She gets lots of compliments from the other residents and visitors. I like it because it's all natural.
5,28-Jun-18,5,Ok I thought the smells would be more potent. I guess I have grown accustomed to Bath and Bodyworks candles. These are OK but the smell doesn‚Äôt travel much farther then the area right around the candle.
5,30-Aug-20,3,"Not bad, but expensive for what you get...not a strong scent. Awaken+invigorate I have to agree with some other reviews. Smell is dull, not a bad scent.  it's just that you barely feel it in the environment ... I think for the same money you get more from the Bath and Body candles"
5,24-Mar-19,1,I would not purchase this again While this candle is in a beautiful container it has absolutely no fragrance in three different candles I tried. It shipped beautifully it‚Äôs packaged beautifully and it is beautiful candle that has absolutely no scent.
5,24-Mar-19,5,"Awesome scent This was a gift for my best friend. She lived it. But when I went to visit her, she had it burning in the foyer, and what a wonderful, calming aroma entering her house. Sets the mood of zen all around you. Awesome!!!"
5,4-Aug-19,2,"not much scent It's soy so that is good, I suppose. It doesn't give off much of a scent, but I wanted to try it and get it out of my system. I doubt I will buy more scented candles."
5,20-Jul-18,5,Love Love Love This Candle! I bought another scent of this same candle for my sister and she absolutely loved it.  With her being a candle connoisseur I knew it had to be awesome so I bought another one!  Amazing!  I love the how the different kinds can impact or enhance your mood!  I plan on buying a collection next time.
5,20-Jan-20,5,"Perfect in every way! I love this scent! it‚Äôs fresh, clean & light and the glass container with wood top that it‚Äôs housed in is beautiful on it‚Äôs own. The packaging for the 1st 2 I ordered was really sloppy & loose but they were not damaged at all. I‚Äôve since ordered several more pairs to give as gifts and they were boxed in their original packaging that was very tight with form shaped protection.  A great buy!"
5,1-Apr-20,1,Absolutely no scene I ordered two of these and neither one have much of a smell when you take the lid off.  No smell when they burn either.  Other scenes such as cranberry are very good.
5,31-Dec-18,5,"Amazing Candle...Yankee doesn't have anything on them! I purchased this as part of a gift basket I was making for someone. Needless to say, the smell was so refreshing, clean, and calming...I decided to keep it for myself. Once I burned it downstairs, I could smell it upstairs. I was shocked because it's rare you find a candle that can reach two floors. I definitely prefer this brand over Yankee Candle. I will be buying this line again. I'm excited to try the others!"
5,14-Jan-20,1,No fragrance! I wish I wouldn‚Äôt have purchased this candle. It doesn‚Äôt have a smell other than old wax.  Glass jar is attractive. I read through the reviews before I purchased and wish I would have gone with another candle.  The bad reviews are all saying that there isn‚Äôt a smell!
5,18-May-20,3,"Didn't get the right candle I ordered the Balance & Harmony candle, however I received Peace & Tranquility candle.  The candle I received smells good so it's not a total loss but it was a gift."
5,7-Dec-18,2,"Little too potent Once you get all three wicks fired up, you can almost taste the fragrance."
5,10-Nov-20,2,"Overwhelming odor I got this candle in the mail yesterday.  While I like the ""way"" it smells, it's just overpowering.  My office is not particularly small nor stuffy yet within 5 minutes of lighting it it gave me a headache and I had to put it out.  Perhaps it would work in a very large, open space.  I will be moving it from my office to the open area where our kitchen, dining, and living rooms all come together.  Maybe there it'll be tolerable."
5,29-Oct-20,5,Immediately scented my apartment beautifully Within 5 minutes and my apartment smelled absolutely wonderful! I cannot wait to try the other scents. I dont know how long it will last but I will be getting these for now on.
5,11-Sep-20,3,"Smell wasn't worth the price Disclaimer: I did not light this candle to give it a 100% chance, but you know when you take a sniff of a candle at the store before you buy it & think ""OH YA; THAT's THE ONE;"" Well I did NOT have this effect when I opened it & wasn't going to risk the $$ for this big ole tub of wax."
5,2-Jun-20,4,Pretty but not as good as the others The smell is not very prominent and I expected a larger sized candle for the price that would last longer. I prefer the YCC large candles that last and smell great for the entire jar.
5,11-Oct-20,5,"Great candle! This is inversely all an amazing candle! The packaging was really good, so that the candle arrived in perfect condition. I love how it looks, the only thing I hate is this water lily pear smell. It‚Äôs just too sweet of a smell to me. But that is on me, not the candles fault lol. I will try a different scent next time when I reorder!"
5,2-Jan-20,5,Very slight powdery scent I hate perfumey candles. Esp those that smell like old lady perfume. This is not that scent its a very slight scent but relaxing. I would recommend this candle
5,17-Apr-19,5,"Great candles Beautiful candle. Excellent scents. I bought one for a friend‚Äôs birthday and one for myself. She is really into candles and loved the scent, jar and wooden lid. Very high quality candle at a great price!"
5,12-Sep-20,2,"Not Jasmine Jasmine is one of my favorite scents in the world- which is why I bought this.  This candle is NOT jasmine scented.  It's a nice scent, but it's not jasmine.  I returned it."
5,1-Dec-19,5,"Aromatic They smell awesome and lasted for about 4 days,  with them burning from 8-6 pm. I'd recommend and have repurchased numerous times.  I'll be buying the larger size soon."
5,11-Jul-20,1,No fragrance?! I thought this candle would smell really good since Yankee owns this company so I took a chance and bought one. I literally don‚Äôt smell anything! It‚Äôs like they forgot to put any fragrance in this candle. Very disappointing!
5,25-Nov-19,4,Great scent Was a hit as gift
5,31-Jul-19,4,Tunneling has dissipated. This is an update.  I earlier reported that the  candle tunneled. After 3 burnings the wax melted down. I like the scent.
5,2-Jan-20,4,Which brand again??? The scent was very lovely! I was leery and didn't know what to expect buying before smelling. I gave this product 4 stars because it's a gift and it came in a different brand box. Why???? That's tacky!!!!
5,9-Jan-19,3,Uneven burn These candles smell great and filled my entire apartment with only one lit. They seem to last around the prescribed time. My only complaint is they do not burn evenly and you end up wasting allot of candle
5,21-Jul-19,3,Too light to smell Used product for my home. Very mild scent. Need to stand over it to smell it
5,9-Aug-20,4,"Good candle, bad packaging. I love the color of the glass on the candle. The scent is fresh but light. I don‚Äôt have any issues with the candle, I‚Äôm just surprised it made it in one piece because it was boxed in a very oversized box with no paper or padding."
5,6-Apr-20,5,Must buy! The lavender scented candle is the best scent by far. Do yourself a favor and purchase this if you love lavender scent like me! It smells up my whole house
5,19-Nov-18,5,Good value Lovely container and looked more expensive than it was. Delightfully ‚Äúlight‚Äù scent- not overpowering. Gave as part of birthday gift.
5,23-Jun-20,5,"scent is  amazing I bought this candle online instead of getting them at a store due to shutdowns, it is a great scent love it and it is lasting along time really love this brand of candle"
5,8-Aug-20,3,"Tunnels badly The packaging is great, the scent is great, the candle looks great...but the tunneling is awful. I‚Äôve never had a candle tunnel so badly. It‚Äôs very disappointing."
5,3-Sep-19,5,"Smell is fantastic These were a great purchase, and a bot cheaper than the ones we normally buy locally that smell similar.  I do wish they had the crackle/wood wicks, but that's just a personal twist."
5,21-Jul-20,2,DISAPPOINTED- NO SMELL I loved the smell of this candle but I was expecting this candle to have a strong throw. I could barely smell it when lit and I had it in my bedroom which is small. Disappointed. They used to have nice strong throws but seems like quality has gone way down and price gone up.
5,13-Jul-20,2,"Scent? Not much of a scent. Sadly, I get a better scent in the generic $8.00 ones I buy. I had a gift card so this was free to me. I will not be purchasing with my own money."
5,23-Aug-18,5,Nice candles. This one is my favorite scent of ... Nice candles.  This one is my favorite scent of theirs.  Burns long time and pretty clean.  Like the wood lids.
5,28-Feb-20,5,"Soy is the way to go! One scent is lovelier than the next, I adore these candles and usually gift a pack of two to friends and teachers.  My kids also use them in their room"
5,10-Aug-19,4,"Smells great burns even. There‚Äôs just something about a 3 wick candle when it makes all of the wax burn perfectly evenly... this candle has that something. It smells nice, not overwhelming (which is good!) it‚Äôs lasted a lot longer than much more expensive ones have, not going back to those!"
5,7-Jun-18,5,Great gift Sent it as a gift to one of my girlfriends when she was having a rough day. She LOVED it...especially the jar it came in. Going to buy one for myself!
5,13-May-19,5,Best candle ever! Hands down my favorite scent combo in the whole world. I hope They never ever stop making this candle!I would Describe the scent as a good smelling campfire. A masculine scent but something everyone would love
5,28-Nov-18,3,Nice but too strong for me Nice candle but the scent was a bit too strong for my liking
5,16-Sep-19,1,It doesn't have much smell I saw this product in target and was not able to buy in target. When i saw it on here i thought it would have the same scent and everything. The candle has no scent but it does last long!
5,9-Jul-20,5,Wonderful Scent and Long Lasting This is a great candle. I lit it every day for two weeks straight - working from home. It would burn for about 4 hours/day. The scent was perfect and not over-powering.
5,12-Nov-20,5,Nice clean scent Light clean scent. Reminds me of green tea with more lemongrass added. I have not flipped the reeds for over a week and the throw is quite good. It‚Äôs perfect for my spare room that doubles as a sewing studio. I would definitely purchase again
5,10-Feb-20,5,"Smells Lovely This candle smells so good!  You can smell it even when it is not lit, but it's a fresh scent and not overpowering.  Just a pleasant smell as you're walking by..  I am sending one to my sister as a small birthday gift.  Lasts long and price is good."
5,9-Sep-20,5,best candles I loooove these candles. They smell amazing! Their scent is super relaxing. I like that they last long and that the fragrance is strong but definitely not overwhelming. Im always ordering these.
5,17-Mar-20,2,Made allergies/ asthma flare up...... I loved the pink candle and it didn't seem to bother anybodys' allergies/ asthma but the purple jar (I'm sorry but I don't remember the scents) really aggravated my husband and sons asthma and yes even the dog (he's allergic to everything and when I'd try to burn it he'd start a dry hack.). I thought it smelled alright but no candle is worth any of my boys.
5,18-Feb-19,5,"Love the scent, will buy again! I got the medium size in balance and harmony. I LOVE the scent. It is so refreshing and fills the room but isn't overwhelming. I was skeptical about its size, but the scent is stronger and the burn time longer than some 18oz candles I have! Reasonable price too. Will definitely buy again."
5,17-Oct-20,2,"Doesn't smell like anything I got the peace + tranquility candle after finishing off my favorite (and discontinued) cashmere candle from another brand. While the candle itself is very pretty, it barely smells like anything. I would not purchase from this brand again."
5,24-Apr-20,5,Our favorite candle I love these candles they smell good and are strong scented but not too much they last a long time and are at a good price point for a candle this size
5,10-Dec-18,1,NOT WHAT I ORDERED I ordered ‚ÄòPeace and Tranquility‚Äô for a friend who just lost her father. I ordered in time to give it to her the following day the package was to arrive.  I received ‚ÄòBalance and Harmony‚Äô. It does smell good but it is NOT what I ordered and has no meaning for this situation - which is why I chose Chesapeake Bay in the first place. DISAPPOINTED.
5,3-Aug-20,5,"Subtle Smell Very subtle smell so good for small spaces, like an office, and while relaxing at home. I would have liked it to be stronger but for the price its great."
5,1-Oct-20,2,"broken i was looking forward to this product, unfortunately came all broken.. won‚Äôt be able to use at all. $20 gone, shame."
5,14-Jul-20,5,Great Candles I freaking loved this candle and now want one of each scent. I‚Äôve been going through some stressful times (as we all are) and the Balance + Harmony water lily pear added a gentle warmth to the room. It literally just went out for the final time a moment ago as there is ZERO wax left. Lasted quite a while too!!
5,9-Feb-20,5,This one really works This reed diffuser actually does the job. It fills the room with a wonderful aroma. Beautiful packaging. Great for your own home or as a gift. I will definitely purchase this again.
5,27-Dec-18,5,Smells like heaven These candles smell like heaven...I was amazed at how beautiful the smell was especially because I purchased it without any clue of what it would smell like. I bought these as gifts and not only were they sentimental because of their meaning but the scent really does relax you!
5,19-Dec-17,4,"Just the right smell, not overwhelming Really nice candle....not very strong so you can let it go for a couple of hours and not get overwhelmed by the smell."
5,29-Sep-20,1,Weak Two thumbs down
5,22-Feb-20,3,Scent There was no scent or very very light. Also the candle burned more to one side not evenly.
5,23-Jul-20,5,Beautiful Scent - evenly burns! Love these ‚ù§Ô?è I love these candles! They burn evenly so as to not make like a funnel? And they smell amazing. It‚Äôs just a great buy! I was so happy that I was able to find them on Amazon! I also believe they are a bit cheaper than the target options - trust me just buy it. You can thank me later ‚ò?Ô?è
5,18-Apr-20,3,Messed Up Wick I love these candles and this is my first time ordering them and there was an issue. The wick was practically non existent when it arrived and it was obvious it had been used a few times. I'm sad!
5,3-Jan-20,1,My candle exploded I have bought several of these candles and never had a problem. This one burned to the bottom and exploded. Scared the crap out of me! Thank goodness I was sitting next to it when it happened.  If I wasn‚Äôt I fear that the house could have burned down. Make sure you don‚Äôt burn it to the end.
5,24-Oct-20,1,"Not worth the money Smells great, burns up super freaking quick for a candle this expensive."
5,9-Jun-19,2,"Smell felt ""artificial"" and more like synthetic oil/something else It was very aromatic (smelly?) - filled a 4 car garage with its smell in only about 30 minutes, but it wasn't pleasant at all.  I've used the cheap stuff from Walmart/Target before and was very impressed with it for 1/3 of the price of this - thought I'd be getting something nicer/fresher at the higher dollar amount."
5,11-May-19,5,"A wonderful surprise :) This was a total surprise!  The scent was wonderfully clean and refreshing.  I will certainly be purchasing them again not only for their quality, but also because they are a fair price."
5,31-Mar-17,5,"Smells Divine! Purchased this as a door prize for a bridal shower I'm hosting, this spring. Delivery was fast!Honestly, I'm pretty tempted to just keep this for myself; it smells delicious."
5,6-Apr-20,3,"Meh?üòí I absolutely loved the smell of the candle. It was delicious before I lit. So it definitely creates that relaxed ambiance, but you have to really sit close the candle to smell it. That's the biggest issue I had. I definitely would say stick to a bath and body works candle at least you can an smell it around the room."
5,21-Sep-18,5,Worth every cent Smells great and burns nicely. The glass it's in will serve purposes after the candle is gone. Excellent quality.
5,22-Aug-20,5,"Love it! Smells like straight up men‚Äôs body spray (in the best possible way). I LOVE warm, earthy scents like this - it‚Äôs exactly what I expected. Permeates the room but doesn‚Äôt overpower and looks sleek. Great price for a three-wick too. Highly recommend."
5,3-Jan-20,2,"Burns away in two weeks!!! This is my second time buying the peace and tranquility candle because I love the scent ‚Äî it seriously smells delicious. That being said, I started burning the product next to a gifted, TJ Max Yankee Candle and after two weeks it has pretty much disintegrated. I would buy again for the scent but the fact that it burns so quickly doesn‚Äôt make up for the price. Id rather buy a discounted candle that burns at 1/3 of the rate than keep buying the Chesapeake bay."
5,5-May-20,1,"A ripoff A ripoff. A waste of money. Three small 3.7 oz  soy candles in individual colored frost glass for each scent. Scent is barely available and each one only lasted about 48 hrs. Not worth the price at $20 per candle. Don‚Äôt buy this. As a gift for someone, it will be an embarrassment to you, the giver with good intentions. Forget it."
5,6-Nov-19,5,ONLY CANDLE WORTH BUYING I have been searching for candles that have a scent that fills the house.  Bought a lot of ones on Amazon that said they were very fragrant but they liked. Chesapeake Bay Candle Co. candles are the ONLY ones I have found that spread their aroma through the house.  DON'T BUY ANYTHING ELSE if scent is what you are looking for. These are the BOMB!
5,27-Dec-19,1,Beware! Smells like chemicals! The vase is nice but ...Smells like chemicals - nothing like essential oils- beware you can‚Äôt return it even through Amazon Prime .. or I would have sent it right back. No pear no water lily
5,27-Mar-17,5,Great candle Love it!  The smell is amazing!  And strong!  I could smell the candle in the adjoining rooms and the Chesapeake candles always burn nice and even.
5,20-Aug-20,3,"Broken diffuser bottle Unfortunately the diffuser bottle arrived with the glass broken so just beware that buying online might not be the best choice. The item is not returnable, so I just bought a glass bottle to pour the fragrance in instead. The fragrance smells great, albeit a little too masculine for me. I like how strong/pungent the fragrance is so I will probably purchase again but a different fragrance next time."
5,31-Oct-19,1,Tiny and unscented I could barely smell the scent on all of them. I tried burning them and smelled nothing. Now I can‚Äôt return. Definitely overpriced for tiny votive candles with hardly any scent. I thought Bundle 2 meant you get x2 of the product...WRONG.
5,9-Nov-19,1,"SMELL NOT LASTING OR STRONG! ITEM LOOKS VERY NICE,HOWEVER THE SCENT DOES NOT LAST LONG AT ALL!!!WALKING ONTO THE BEDROOM,CLOSED DOOR,NO SMELL OF THIS CANDLE!DO NOT BUY FOR A SCENT,IT IS NOT STRONG IN MY OPINION"
5,10-Apr-20,5,"Best candle! This is likely the best candleI‚Äôve ever had. The smell is incredible and it‚Äôs long lasting.Quality, nice looking glass container and unique lid."
5,5-Sep-19,5,Good Smells wonderful
5,16-May-20,5,The slow burning candle by chesapeake bay The clean yet flowery slow burn of this candle had me on day one
5,22-Jul-20,5,"Bought this twice. It smells that good Im guilty of buying very expensive candles, Jo Malone, Votivo etc but this cheaper version smells just as good. It isn't sweet nor is it too citrusy. Its lovely. Its also quite a big candle. It makes the whole room smell lovely (even after cooking salmon!!) Will definitely purchase again"
5,17-Oct-20,4,"Glass cracked Only had a few days, scent was releasing & I loved it. Then I accidentally tipped it over on the counter with edge of towel. Totally my fault, but what disappointed me was that the glass cracked so I couldn‚Äôt even salvage the remaining liquid or reuse the vessel. It wasn‚Äôt a hard crash or fall, just tipped over. Evidently the glass is very fragile so beware."
5,7-Feb-20,2,"Looks Nice, No Scent Nice modern-beach look, but very weak scent (must burn 1+ hours for anything - this is in a small bedroom with regular ceiling height).  Would not buy again."
5,7-Nov-20,2,"Intolerable scent The scent in intolerable. The reviews I had read had said it was a clean scent... I totally disagree, smells like musty old ladies.I will say, it was packaged extremely well for shipping."
5,23-Aug-20,3,"Was not bad This scent was not bad, it would of been better if they would of left out the eucalyptus scent to it. Price was the best for the size."
5,12-Sep-19,5,"Beautiful coloring These candles were beautiful just to look at. The scent was very calming and enjoyable. It was strong enough to fill the air, but they weren't overpowering. There weren't any dents or damage to the glass or lids when I received them."
5,16-May-19,5,"Wonderful light scent, beautiful candle. I love these candles! I can't handle most strongly scented candles, as they give me migraines. The basil mint is a nice, light scent that makes my whole room smell clean and fresh. It isn't overpowering, and the candle lasts quite a while. Additionally, the jar is very pretty."
5,15-Dec-18,5,"Fits description! Excellence in a Candle! It is a soothing, great scent  Clean burn & very pretty. I do hope actual boxes from Chesapeake are offered as I purchased the last 2 for gifts & 1 came in a bubble bag & 2nd in a Yankee box."
5,5-Apr-18,5,Love this candle Love this candle! From it's light fresh scent to the clean burn...the glass looked spotless after. No black soot at all!
5,11-May-19,5,Nice scent I have a very sensitive nose to smells. For example elizabeth taylor perfume makes me sick to my stomach. This candle on the other handle has a very nice smooth scent. Its not over powering but you can tell its there
5,1-Oct-19,3,Great candle till it exploded. I have bought many of these Chesapeake Bay Candles.  Never had one explode at the end.  Glass shattered all over the bathroom along with hot wax.  I love these candles but don't let them run too long or too low.
5,17-Jan-19,3,"Beautiful for a Minute The candle, the frosted glass is beautiful. It even has a light nice scent.Unfortunately, this is not meant for more than appearance or short lighting. They completely burn out in 2 hours.I wish they had any reliability and I'd put them all over. Definitely not worth the price."
5,19-May-20,1,Poor Candles I ordered the set of 2 water lily pear Chesapeake Bay Candles because it‚Äôs taken a month for my Bath & Body Works candles to ship. These candles are honestly horrible. The scent is nice but they don‚Äôt fill a room whatsoever - even a smaller room. They also don‚Äôt burn evenly around the wick. The wax is caked up on either side of it. I don‚Äôt recommend these and I‚Äôve already initiated the return process.
5,12-Aug-20,5,"Beautiful jar, lovely scent and pleasing to the eye! I absolutely love this candle and the beautiful frosted jar it came in. The fragrance is light but definitely fills the air. I shared the double pack with my daughter and she loves it too. I can't comment on the longevity as of yet but I'll come back for that. Right now it's on my repurchase list!"
5,10-Dec-18,5,"Good! Enjoying this candle! Not any better or worse than others, about the right pricepoint if you're used to buying at places like Bath and Bodyworks. Definitely an interesting fragrance combo. Mostly lemongrass with undertones of eucalyptus."
5,20-Oct-17,5,"Soooo Good This smells sooooo delicious and is enough to fill up my whole condo with a hint of deliciousness. I was skeptical about buying candles online, not being able to smell them, and them shipping in warm temperatures and being glass. They were wrapped extremely well and came perfect! I will buy again and again!!"
5,1-Feb-20,5,"Better than others I‚Äôve bought several brands trying to find one that lasted long enough for the price. This one is definitely the best, I‚Äôve already reordered a second one for a different room."
5,21-Jan-19,5,"The Perfect Smelling Candle As an avid candle buyer (both high end and budget friendly), scents and quality are everything to me. I purchased the ‚ÄúPeace and Tranquillity‚Äù scent in the medium size and I must say, the smell is heavenly. The subtle notes of jasmine and lily, with a hint of lemon are quite divine and will appeal to anyone looking for a tranquil, relaxing scent."
5,1-Apr-19,2,"Weak Scent Very weak smell. Love the candle version, but the scent in this one is almost non-existent. May be best in a real small room such as a bathroom."
5,2-Jul-19,4,"This candle takes you to a different place, every time you light it! I love this candle from it's clean crisp packaging to it's clean fragrance. I burn this candle often. I am taken to a new place every time I burn it. One of my favorites!"
5,30-Dec-19,5,ITTTSSSS GREAT Smells good. Good like your grandmother‚Äôs kitchen on thanksgiving.Good like you ain‚Äôt gotta sign no prenup.Good like you took yo mamas deed to the house.Good like you just got it in on prom night.
5,16-Jan-20,3,It was cheap Channel does burn slow in evenly but has almost no scent now that it has been open longer than a week so if you're going to buy one make sure you burn it fast for buy a different scent than this one
5,5-Oct-20,5,"Great candle! Bought this for shelf decor in our remodeled bathroom, it looks fabulous and smells really good. Classy, zen vibes! Recommended!"
5,28-Mar-18,5,Fresh and Clean Wonderful Candles! Love the scent. Not overwhelming like other brands.
5,9-Sep-20,1,"Wick will not stay lit I love the scent of this candle, but after burning it for around an hour, the wick will just not stay lit anymore. I'm not sure if I received a candle with a defective wick, but now I am stuck with a block of soy wax that does not burn. I expected more after all of these glowing reviews. Maybe it's something I am doing wrong, but none of my other candles need any tending like this one apparently does."
5,12-Mar-19,5,"Great smelling and good looking I‚Äôve purchased three of these candles in difference scents. They are all great.  The wax soy blend doesn‚Äôt create black smoke from the candle. These are cheaper than a lot of the other candles out there and, in my opinion, a better scent."
5,11-Dec-17,3,This candle has a very nice fragrance but isn‚Äôt for a large room This candle has a very nice fragrance but isn‚Äôt for a large room. I used it in a smaller room and it did fine.
5,11-Dec-17,5,"nice quality and really pretty Lovely smell,  nice quality and really pretty!"
5,29-Apr-20,1,"Poor scent throw, terrible tunneling. This candle is very poor quality. The scent doesn‚Äôt have a good throw, and it has terrible tunneling. Incredibly disappointed."
5,10-Sep-19,5,Balance + Harmony perfection This is my absolute favorite candle scent.  I usually buy them at Target but this is such an amazing deal.  They were packaged beautifully and delivered safely.  Will be buying more for sure
5,2-Sep-20,2,"Smells more like smoke Cute item, but it didn't smell as expected. Well, there was no scent at all... it smelled more like smoke from the wick than the actual candle. Kinda disappointed.. I was better off buying a slightly more expensive candle. Literally this did not smell like anything."
5,20-Mar-20,1,The wick is missing from the candle???? I ordered a number of these candles - one came without a wick:( - please let me know what to do since I am quarentine and cannot leave my home. The candle on the far left has no wick. I even dug into the wax to look for it - nothing. Please resend me another one please.
5,10-Nov-18,5,"LOVE THIS CANDLE This candle smells amazing! As soon as I opened the box, the sweet, clean scent enveloped my nose and I had to light it right then and there!"
5,26-Aug-18,5,"Smells great without overwhelming The diffuser smells amazing. In my small bathroom, just enough scent without being overpowering. Smells kinda like Aversa rosemary mint shampoo"
5,14-May-19,5,"Loving My Candle!! What a great purchase this was!! The candle arrived in 2 days, was safely packaged & smells glorious. Will definitely buy from this seller again!! Thanks so much!!"
5,10-Jan-20,1,"Can‚Äôt smell it Love the scent and size of candle.  But once lit, it doesn‚Äôt throw the scent and it only burns in the middle. I expected more.  I would not buy again."
5,23-Sep-18,5,Quality candle worth the price These candles smell nice and fill a room without being overpowering
5,17-Jul-19,5,"Great candles for the bedroom Great candles. Love the convenience of shipping to home, aroma is good and the candles last as long or longer than other candles we purchase at the store."
5,28-Apr-20,5,Close your eyes and drift away to an island ?üèù paradise ?üåû Just received my peace & tranquility diffuser.  Simply love love love it! ‚ù§ It smells sweet clean and fresh. I bought it for my bathroom.  I'll be adding these to my Christmas list as a little additional treat for friends and family. I'll most definitely be trying the different scents ?üëç
5,13-Jan-20,5,Superb Quality Candles A wonderful candle with a lovely  soft floral scent with a long burn time.This would make a wonderful gift for anyone including yourself!I will be buying more of these candles in this and other scents. Great value for price! Superb quality!
5,5-Jun-19,4,"Not my favorite scent. This is a lovely candle and lasts a long time, but I wasn't crazy about the scent this time. I usually love their candles!"
5,3-Jan-19,5,Smells nice Picked this up to burn in my office while I'm working. It smells nearly identical to a firewood candle I used to get years ago that is no longer available. Happy to find a replacement.
5,31-May-20,1,"‚ÄúRosewater‚Äù scent is horrible The rosewater scent is horrible. I don‚Äôt know how to describe it but after a few hours of trying to let it grow on me, I had to put it out on the curb. And my house still stinks! So I guess the product works well in terms of producing a scent, but the scent itself is not pleasing at all."
5,5-Feb-20,1,"Scented candle has obnoxious odor This scented candle casts off an odor which is quite obnoxious! Within seconds of lighting the wick, my wife and I both agreed that this was the worst scented candle we have ever purchased - EVER! If there was a way that this could be returned to get a credit, I would...immediately!"
5,27-Mar-20,5,Smells great! I was hesitant to buy a candle I've never smelled before online but this was a great purchase! I got the Balance and Harmony candle and I love the way it smells. It burns for a long time and I could definitely see myself buying this again.
5,26-Jan-20,2,"Pretty jar, not great scent. With al the great reviews I have to say I was really disappointed with the scent.  It didn‚Äôt smell natural or refreshing."
5,19-May-19,5,"What a great smelling surprise I definitely enjoy scented candles however I have never bought any on Amazon, I took a chance after I researched a few sellers. I totally love this purchase and i truly recommend these candles or ones you may find in the collection from this seller."
5,4-Dec-18,5,Eligant jar Nice smell. Wooden top is very pretty
5,13-Dec-19,5,"Longlasting, Lovely Scent Oh my! This candle smells AMAZING!! it fills the room with a lovely scent without burning quickly. I'm impressed with how the scent of this candle is throughout the entire candle & not like others that are only at the top. I'm definitely buying more!!"
5,15-Jan-19,4,Smell is a bit off from the description Not quite the scent the description says it is. I gave it to a friend and she loves it. It burns slowly and the jar is a nice heavy jar that be reused.
5,11-Nov-20,5,Good buy I was skeptical on the scent because it didn‚Äôt smell much when I took the lid off but the aroma is great in a small room.
5,24-Nov-19,5,"Smell is long lasting my mother smokes inside the house, and I hate the smell it leaves, I bought this candle, and within 10 mins the house had this wonderful lavender smell! I would buy it again, great for a gift too"
5,9-Sep-20,5,Would definitely buy again The candle looks beautiful in my living room. The fragrance is just as stated. And it came naturally box that you could give us a gift.
5,12-Dec-19,5,I feel like Aqua Man when I smell this candle I close my eyes and I'm whisked away to the bay.  The sweet smell of this candle makes me want to sail the seven seas.
5,19-Aug-19,2,Uneven melt I wanted to love these candles. However they don‚Äôt burn evenly. So disappointed. I‚Äôll stick to Mainstay brand at Walmart.
5,5-Jul-20,5,"SUPER AMAZING !!!!! ?üòç ?üïØ This candle is INSANELY Amazing, The smell is beautiful & strong. It does't make a headache.Highly recommend it!!!!! It's reminds me of Bath&BodyWorks' candles!LOVE IT 100%"
5,20-Apr-20,5,Definitely recommend I bought this candle after a friend had put it on Christmas list.  I love the smell and it lasts a long time.  I probably turn it on about 3 to 4 times a week.
5,7-Feb-20,5,"Very soothing scent! Smells so good, and is very potent! I'm so happy with this, (as a pregnant lady it's not too overbearing either!) My hubby gifted it to me and it's definitely a favorite!"
5,9-Jan-19,5,"Great Scent! Wonderful fruity scent. As other customers have noted, the smell is not overbearing if burned for a long time, which was important to the person I bought it for. Worth the price!"
5,16-Aug-20,4,"Manly scent The confidence and freedom scent smells like men‚Äôs cologne. It smells good, but just smells like a man. A very good smelling man."
5,6-Nov-20,2,"Seemed like a knock off I ordered the Chesapeake Bay candle. It arrived in a Yankee candle box. The wick was almost non existent, I had to dig it out to be able to light it.  After I lit it the melted wax put out the flame so I had to pour out wax to keep the flame lit. The candle smells great I must say but I think this candle was priced cheaper for a reason."
5,26-Sep-19,5,"Smells amazing- lasts forever! I originally bought this for a friend for her birthday, but ended up keeping it for myself because I loved the smell so much! I burn it quite often and it‚Äôs still got plenty of life left in it!"
5,16-Feb-18,5,Love this smell. I bought the smaller version of this candle at the local market and loved it. I got this large sized one for the same price as my local store was charging for the tiny one.
5,2-Dec-18,5,"good candles Last a long time, smell good."
5,30-Jan-20,5,Love the scent! Bought this for myself & glad I did! Smells amazing. Seems to burn a little more quickly than some but still worth the buy!
5,27-Apr-20,5,Smell beautiful! I love the smell! Definitely my new favorite candle but I‚Äôm also looking forward to trying the other scent as well!
5,22-Apr-19,3,Not the size I was expecting I haven‚Äôt burned it yet as I have just received it. Right off the bat I‚Äôm disappointed. The picture and description of the product made the candle seem much bigger. Definitely not worth the money for the size but I‚Äôll burn it anyway.
5,9-Oct-20,5,"Great smell and seems to be lasting Pretty well. I love the smell of the candle , it is also pretty and looks nice among the house. I would definitely recommend it."
5,21-Apr-20,5,"Great gift, to someone else or yourself ?üòÇ Bought as a gift for a candle connoisseur and was very well received! The scent is wonderful and longevity is ?üëå?üèº?üëå?üèº?üëå?üèº"
5,6-Nov-18,2,Doesn't last long I love the scents of these candles and I was so excited to light them for the first time. After only lighting them twice for a very short time and they are already burned up past half way. I am so disappointed in the candles burn time. They do smell wonderful when lit but I wish they didn't burn up in two 30 minute burns.
5,21-Aug-19,4,"Pretty Soothing Bought this for my friend's place, which has a STRONG dog smell. It didn't eliminate or lessen the odor by a lot, but having it there was soothing and I can tell it's going to last long. HOPEFULLY, they use it ALL the time!"
5,1-Dec-19,3,"Pretty to look at but not very scented I love the overall look of the glass jar the candle came in. However, the candle itself has a very light/ faint scent. I had to stand very close to it in order to catch it‚Äôs scent. After reading some of the positive reviews, I‚Äôm a bit disappointed. And would have to agree that it has very nice packaging but it‚Äôs scent is not strong enough. I purchased the Peace + Tranquility candle."
5,20-Nov-20,3,"Long Lasting but Strong in scent. This candle will last a very long time, depending on how long you burn it. I like to burn candles about 3 hours in the evening (off and on). This candle for me is very strong and had a somewhat earthy scent. Not bad, however, I prefer vanilla, cinnamon and fresh linen scents."
5,5-Jan-20,1,Not for me Incredibly disappointed. Scent does not match description. The pepper is so overwhelming in this candle that I can‚Äôt even use it. Extremely upset with my hard earned  money down the drain and no relaxing candle.
5,6-Jul-19,5,Perfectly scented Just the scent I was looking for. It's not too strong but just perfect enough to leave a subtle scent. I have this in my (small) office and the scent is not overwhelming at all. I've had it for few a few months and the scent remains. I do flip the reeds once in a while or stir them up a bit. Will definitely buy again when needed.
5,18-Jan-20,5,"Wonderful scent, arrived in perfect condition My favorite scent from Chesapeake is Peace and Tranquility, it smells like Hygge in a candle, comforting, inviting, warm - like home!"
5,20-Aug-20,3,"Won‚Äôt buy again I bought a package of two candles.  Not much scent, doesn‚Äôt fill the room.  And both candles have  gaps in the wax fill."
5,7-Sep-20,5,"Lovely candle This candle is amazing. I highly recommend it. The color is beautiful, and smell is fresh and honesty invigorating just like it says. The smell isn't too strong which is also nice. Very nice candle, will definitely purchase again."
5,22-Jul-20,5,Nice smell The best smelling candle HANDS DOWN! I‚Äôm very sensitive to harsh perfume smells and it takes me a long time to find a candle that is tolerable.  This one is ?üíØ
5,17-Oct-20,1,No scent throw There is absolutely no throw. I had the candle lit on the dining room table when eating and none of us could smell it.  What a waste of my money.  Would never purchase from this company again.  This is the 2nd candle of this brand I‚Äôve purchased and neither have had a throw.
5,10-Jan-20,5,"Lasted six months I‚Äôve gotten a lot of time with this candle. I burned it almost weekly for hours at a time and it has lasted right at six months. It burns slow, the fragrance isn‚Äôt strong and it‚Äôs a nice quality."
5,12-Oct-18,5,"Classic smell and use This is a high quality item you could find in a 5 star hotel. Easy to use and lasts, truly provides a great aura."
5,16-Jul-20,4,Perfect to light on a stressful day I gifted this to a friend and she loves it. She stated the scent was nice and warm. Perfect to light on a stressful day.
5,28-Jan-20,5,Almost perfect Almost perfect. The scent is pleasant but not strong enough in my opinion. Last like three times as long as a regular candle though. Worth buying for sure. Smaller than I expected though.
5,7-Feb-20,5,Great candle. Totally love it! It smelled really nice and it burned for an extra long time. It's also very pretty with the thick  glass and wodden top. It'd make a very nice gift for any candle lover.
5,6-Feb-20,3,"Very little scent Not a bad candle, but minimal scent, and it leaves about 20% of the wax in the jar after burning to the bottom."
5,14-Sep-18,5,"Nice Candle. Rather than aroma therapy, I typically use scented candles to scent my home. These are great. You get a really big candle for the price. It lasts a long time and the smell is tasteful but also strong, like you'd expect from a more expensive candle."
5,12-Sep-20,2,"Large and lasts, but not much scent This candle burns evenly and lasts for many hours, but there is barely any sent noticeable when it is burning."
5,28-Oct-20,5,Great Candle Love the scent and others like it also.  This candle has burned and burned and continues to give off a wonderful scent.
5,20-Feb-20,2,Don't waste your Money This candles while excellently priced does not perform very well. It loses its fragrance within a few hours .
5,11-Apr-20,2,"Falls short The packaging/presentation of the candle itself and scent are actually quite nice. I was pleased with it. But, after a few burnings I noticed that scent seems to have wore off entirely already and I have a substantial amount of candle left to go! It‚Äôs burning pace is great‚Äî lasts awhile. But that doesn‚Äôt do me any good if it doesn‚Äôt put out any aroma to enjoy."
5,23-Jun-20,3,Disappointed Received today. Decanter was broken. Took picture but won‚Äôt let me paste. Broken piece not in pkg.  Still able to use. Lovely smell but disappointed.
5,23-Dec-19,1,"Where's the scent? Lovely packaging and beautiful container, but the scent is so faint I really don't smell it in a small room."
5,20-Jan-19,1,This candle is a NO I don‚Äôt know why they would make a candle that doesn‚Äôt make the room smell better. I lit the candle for hours just for my room to smell like it had before. I‚Äôm sticking to bath and body works candle from now on
5,23-Feb-19,5,Great gift My daughter's teacher has candles in her classroom constantly and I wanted to find a good quality one to gift her for Christmas. Love the smells and quality and even the look of them. She was beyond happy to add them to her collection for the kids to enjoy.
5,31-May-19,5,"Great Candle. Excellent candles ?üëç! They burn down beautifully, no holes with the wick. Only negative is that I can't really smell the scent. It's such a good candle that I don't care."
5,5-Jan-19,1,"Avoid the Balance + Harmony diffuser. I never write reviews, but this diffuser was such a colossal disappointment, I had to. I chose the Balance + Harmony (water lily pear) scent, and my entire home now smells like a middle school girls‚Äô locker room. The scent is sickeningly sweet, like a cheap Victoria‚Äôs Secret body spray, but way more obtrusive. There is nothing subtle, inviting or relaxing about the smell. If you like over-the-top fruity flavors, you may like it. Otherwise, I do not recommend."
5,11-Jun-19,5,Smells good! My friend used this for her prayer room and said it smelled really great! Calming colored jar and soothing scent!
5,28-Mar-19,1,Smells like outdoors...ugh This candle smells like outdoors....remember as a kid you go out to play then you come in the house and you smell like outdoors and grass.  That‚Äôs what this smells like and it‚Äôs not a pleasant smell.
5,19-Mar-20,1,Don‚Äôt buy This candle cane yo me looking mangled and gross. I‚Äôm grateful this wasn‚Äôt a gift for someone. The wick isn‚Äôt burned but this candle looks like it sat in a house for ten years before being delivered to me.
5,18-Oct-20,1,"Nope! Burns WAY WAY TOOOOOO FAST! Halfway through and the wick will not stay up, no smell & nothing worth buying"
5,11-Feb-20,5,Nice gift These candles burn well and for quite a long time but I did find the fragrances of two different kinds quite strong
5,21-Apr-20,5,"love the scent, though a bit pricey I love the lemongrass scent, it's so refreshing. The bottle is a good decoration in the bathroom as well. The only thing is it is a bit pricer than other ones I found on amazon. But very satisfied with the result."
5,27-Apr-20,5,"Soft, sweet citrus scent! I really love this candle! The scent is so soft & beautiful. It smells like citrus. It also burns slowly."
5,26-Nov-19,1,Week fragrance. Not strong enough for my rooms. Needs more oils in the wax. I‚Äôve found less pricy ones that are stronger and can fill the house with beautiful fragrance.
5,3-Nov-20,5,"No scent It has very little, if any scent. I've purchased the Peace and Tranquility candle and loved it. This one was disappointing."
5,26-May-19,5,"Exceptional overall At first I wasn‚Äôt sure about these candles, I thought the would be larger like bath & body works tall candles. However, after using them, they are better! They burn slower and fill the room with a beautiful scent. Highly recommend!!"
5,3-Oct-19,5,Best fragrance I absolutely love this candle. My therapist‚Äôs office had the diffuser and I had to specifically ask for the scent so I could buy it for my house. It‚Äôs light and warming. The jar is nice to look at too.
5,7-Feb-20,4,"Candle Candles, in general, are too expensive.  Most don't even smell too much.  I'd rather buy them in person."
5,6-Apr-20,2,"What Smell Is It The scent was not distinguishable at all. If it wasn't for the flame, you couldn't tell that I even lit the candles. The scent was so faint that it made no sense to light a scented candle."
5,21-Oct-20,2,Its a bummer you can't refill!! It was great while it lasted but to be unable to refill the liquid ruins it! Not only is it wasteful but expensive to order a full new unit.
5,14-Jul-19,4,"Spa-like aroma Adds a spa scent to my jacuzzi tub. Doesn't burn as evenly as I'd like, leaving a well in the middle of a bunch of unused wax. Glad I purchased as a warehouse item, would consider buying on sale again."
5,14-May-20,1,"Broken... again Came broken no option for refund and isn‚Äôt eligible for return, this is the 3rd time I order this and 2 have arrived broken."
5,30-Jan-20,1,Shame on this seller shame on them Terrible just terrible such a waste of money so blatantly misrepresented for shame for shame for shame
5,18-Jan-20,4,Love the smell Love the scent of this candle. It is not an over powering smell. It‚Äôs like a claiming floral scent. It‚Äôs a four star because it burns unevenly which you can tell my the picture I took.
5,15-Oct-19,5,No chemical smell Loved them so much that I have bought more! Great sent and no problems. Don't bother me like some regular candles.
5,25-Sep-20,3,"Indecisive Very faint smell but it seems consistent I believe. Hard to tell unless I put it in a bedroom or bathroom. The candle is big enough that it should fill the air better than it does. Don‚Äôt expect much of this scent in the common, larger, areas of your home. I may try another scent.... maybe."
5,12-Oct-20,1,43834 Burned 1/3 of the way down and almost then will burn any more Don‚Äôt waste your money on returning it
5,4-Jun-19,5,Excellent candle choice Very nicely made candle that burns and lasts awhile. Great for home or gift. Smell not overpowering.
5,17-Jun-20,5,Love this line! I originally found these candles at Target and I absolutely love this brand and the scents are so refreshing! Definitely recommend if you are looking for a sweet citrus aroma!
5,16-May-19,5,Highly recommend I love these candles and so does all of my friends. There are many different scents So I buy them for everyone on different occasions! Everyone I've given them to brag about how great these candles are.
5,9-Feb-20,5,"Loved it so much, I ordered more! The scent is incredible and it lasts a while. Even still, I reordered more so I have spares when I run out."
5,20-Oct-20,3,Okay! Doesnt have a strong scent which i thought it would! Not for me but maybe will grow on me with time.
5,16-Aug-19,5,"Definitely worth the price, love the scent. So relaxing! Absolutely adore the scent of this candle and will definitely buy it again. Seems to be very long burning and nice container too"
5,30-Nov-18,3,"A little on the small size. Good scent, beautiful glass but a little on the small size for being a medium sized candle. I was expecting something larger than 4 inch piece of glass. Pretty small for a medium candle."
5,22-Jan-20,5,Smell SO good! These candles smell amazing!! I would recommend getting the taller pillar type because they last longer than the shorter ones.
5,21-Aug-19,1,"Heavy Scent This was not the light, clean scent I was expecting.  It's a heavy musk scent that eventually I had to eliminate.  Would not buy again."
5,22-Feb-18,5,"Divine Smells delicious, has a very intimate scent, nothing too powerful or fragrant. I would say it's most noticeable scent is cucumber, and a slight floral hint. It does the job since I have a busy toddler and two large dogs."
5,29-Sep-20,4,Good smell Smell is very good ?üòå I like it but durability is as low as 1 day I was quit disappointed with the durability
5,30-Jan-19,1,I read all the reviews. Love and passion is very light and would not purchase. Disappointed.  It‚Äôs not special.  The cashmere candle ( peace and tranquility) is recommended and second fav is balance and harmony.
5,6-Nov-20,5,Look no further...the perfect candle is here Such a delightful scent.  I literally walked by the room and could smell the aroma.  I will only order these candles in the future.
5,11-Mar-18,2,No good! Yes the packaging is beautiful but I had the candle lit for half the day and didn‚Äôt smell anything. It wasn‚Äôt until after I blew the candle out that I smelled briefly. Which I feel defeats the purpose since it should have a fragrance while lit. I was motivated by the other reviews to purchase it but I won‚Äôt be purchasing this candle again!
5,11-Jul-20,1,"Broken glass Very disappointed glass was cracked, tried burning it, All the wax dripped on the floor, whole mess/ glass everywhere"
5,13-Jan-19,5,My favorite candle ever It has a nice floral full scent. My room does not have the best ventilation so at times it starts to feel a bit dingy and this candle fills the whole room and smells amazing. I repurchase it every time it runs out. I light it almost daily and it lasts months!
5,31-Aug-20,2,No scent... I love this brand but this particular scent was non existent.. I burn candles every single day in my home and was so disappointed in this one
5,23-Mar-20,5,"Great smelling candle Wonderful, long burning candle with a gorgeous scent! Be sure to trim the wick for a consistent burn."
5,8-Sep-17,5,"great scent and price Huge candle, slow burning, great scent and price!!!"
5,14-Feb-20,5,"Works for me Glad I took a chance with this candle! As soon as it was lit the smell was very present, now in several reviews it was stated that in big rooms it doesn't work...mine is in a master bedroom and the scent is very noticeable......To be unbiased i do have a sensitivity to strong perfume odor so maybe that's why its pleasant to me. I really like it."
5,22-Dec-19,5,"Smells amazing Got as a gift, almost kept for myself! Smells heavenly! I'll definitely  be ordering my own soon."
5,14-May-20,5,"Smells wonderful! Love love love this scent! Like that it's fresh, soothing and relaxing. A plus is that it is nontoxic."
5,5-Feb-19,5,Great product! I love these candles. I bought 4 different candles and they all smell great. The smells are not to intense which I love. I would definitely reorder in the future
5,4-Aug-20,5,Great scent The scent is amazing better than expected. The longevity could be better but I‚Äôm still very pleased with the product
5,31-Jan-20,5,Smells great and has a long burn life! Love the scent!  They burn for a long time.  Unfortunately the scent is barely there went lit.  Smell great unlit.
5,23-Apr-20,5,"Amazing candle! I just got this candle today. It's a bit smaller than other coffee table candles I've got in the past. But I have a 1,750 sqft house and I can smell it through the ENTIRE house while lit in my bedroom. I am a huge candle person and I will be ordering more! I am thoroughly impressed."
5,3-Aug-19,1,"Is not worth the stress We bought the Small 3 pack and received just 1 candle? We waited a few days to see if the other 2 candles were delivered, they were not order status notes Order Complete, it is not"
5,23-Dec-19,4,Great I love the scent of this candle-- very clean and crisp. The candle burns clean. It is a bit small for the price.
5,9-Sep-20,5,Best candle I've ever purchased! I am so happy with this candle! I love the smell and longevity of the candle. Definitely I will order this again! Over and over again!
5,18-Oct-20,2,No fragrance Disappointed.. all the reviews were so great but I barely smelled it even when in the same space..
5,16-May-20,1,"Disappointing I‚Äôm a bit disappointed in this candle. It smells great, but I can‚Äôt even use it. The wicks were super short and thin. Basically they won‚Äôt stay lit and the candle is barely burning when it is lit. I would think for a $15 candle, this wouldn‚Äôt be an issue. I don‚Äôt know, maybe I just got a bad one. Really sucks though because I love the scent."
5,9-Mar-19,5,"Perfect This candle is perfect. It has a wonderful scent that is not overpowering like so many candles can be, yet it leaves my bedroom with a lovely, subtle, relaxing scent."
5,17-Oct-20,5,"Great Gift Beautiful candle in a crunch proof box delivered to my door for slightly over $5 , I only regret is that I didn‚Äôt buy a dozen"
5,17-Mar-20,4,"I wouldn't describe the smell as ""invigorating"" My first reed diffuser in years and I really wanted to like it. I'd never used any products by this company so I decided to go for my favorite type of fragrance which is lemongrass. I honestly can hardly detect anything ""lemongrass-y"", the fragrance is on a very sweet side and I keep it on top of one of my kitchen cabinets so it doesn't bother me too much."
5,26-Dec-19,5,Burns well nice scent I gave this to my friend as a Christmas gift and she loves it. She says the scent is wonderful.
5,21-Feb-19,3,They are SMALLER then I thought they'd be! This candle and the other two I've purchased smell wonderful but they are a bit small. I would of rated 5‚òÜ's but I think they are too small for the price.
5,28-Oct-20,2,Save your money My fault for not reading the size. It‚Äôs not worth the money for the size and it‚Äôs not that potent.
5,15-Nov-20,2,Grandma smell Never known which scent will be a winner and this one was not. Very powdery old lady smell.
5,28-Jun-19,1,"Great but ruined a dresser This product fell over which got some of the fluid on the outside of the bottle and the wall. The next day, there was a mark of where the bottle was and another bottle which was next to it on the dresser. It ate away the dresser and the paint on the wall!"
5,10-Feb-20,5,Great candle The peace and tranquility candle smells AMAZING! It has to burn for awhile to smell up my living room. But it‚Äôs worth it! Smells refreshing and truly peaceful.
5,1-Jan-19,5,Very nice! Very nice smell. Not to strong and fills the whole bedroom. I'd highly recommend this candle. Its lasted me a long time as well!
5,31-Oct-18,3,Doesn‚Äôt last long I love the smell but it doesn‚Äôt last long maybe a month
5,15-Apr-20,5,Love it!! Packaging was fantastic!!!!! Candle came unharmed and smells sooooooo sooooo good! Will buy more at another time in other scents as well! Thank you!
5,10-Jan-20,2,Not really enjoying it... My kids & husband don‚Äôt care much for the scent I have to agree the longer it burn the less I like it after all...so it‚Äôs a no for me.
5,24-Dec-19,5,Lovely Candle I love the scent and the longevity of this candle. I have never had a candle last so long while burning it and I love it! I would definitely recommend this candle.
5,17-Mar-19,1,"Not as advertised Scent is nowhere neas as described. It is harsh and waxy, and reminds me of a public restroom. I do not recommend this to anyone looking for a comforting scent."
5,6-Jul-20,2,"Sorry- not worth the price. Sorry - not worth the price. Was looking for a nicely-scented, long-lasting candle for a reasonable price."
5,15-Sep-19,5,"Put in Camper Put these in our camper to deter flys, so far working well, smell is not to overpowering."
5,8-Oct-20,5,Received as a gift for Christmas-had to buy myself another! LOVE this scent! I always tend more towards masculine clean scents and I absolutely adore this one! Candle lasts a very long time and scent is strong but not overpowering.
5,4-Aug-18,3,"Smells good but doesn‚Äôt fill a small room with scent as I hoped Smells great, looks good but doesn‚Äôt fill my small bathroom with scent.  You have to bend over it purposely to smell it."
5,16-Jan-20,5,Smells amazing and small sticks around after burning I got this for my mother in-law and she just asked me where I got it. She said it smelt AMAZING and that the smell is STILL present in her room even after burning out! I got the green colored one (I forgot the scent) I think lemongrass?
5,6-Jan-20,5,"Smells amazing Pleasantly surprised at the fresh scent, it does permeate throughout larger spaces too. Will buy this scent again and try others over the years."
5,8-Jan-20,4,"Good Smells really good. A little costly for a candle, but I do love the scent and the words on it."
5,25-Sep-20,2,Broken candle. One of the candles are broken. I don‚Äôt want to ship broken glass but I do want a refund. We‚Äôll see.
5,12-Feb-20,5,I can't get enough of this clean scent. I fell in love with this scent at a little clothing boutique in Los Angeles County.  Such a clean scent. I can't get enough of it. I've gifted it three times already and keep burning one myself.
5,27-Apr-19,5,"Great candle! Very richly scented, stronger than Yankee and on par with Bath and Body.  Fresh mint scent.  Will buy again and would definitely recommend!"
5,9-Jul-19,4,"Strong smelling Scent too strong, not the citrus I was hoping for. Burns fine and looks nice. I will buy candles in person from now on...I knew the risk I was taking in ordering before smelling."
5,3-Apr-20,1,Waste of money! No scent Waste of money! I can‚Äôt even smell it when I put it in my bath room and close the door.
5,9-Apr-19,5,Perfect I had this lit during my son‚Äôs birthday party. Guests commented that they loved the scent! My sister actually ordered one the next day! It‚Äôs not an overwhelming scent at all.
5,20-Sep-19,3,Great scent but doesn‚Äôt last Beautiful packaging and fresh scent but very difficult to detect aroma unless in a tiny bathroom!
5,21-Oct-20,1,Trash It was awful. I had to toss it. Smelled like the dang house was on fire when we lit it.
5,18-Sep-19,1,No scent from diffuser in small office space I am very confused why anyone likes this diffuser. I have it in my small office space and there is virtually no scent (I got the Confidence and Freedom scent). I have a very sensitive sense of smell and have used other brands of diffusers before that leave a strong scent so it‚Äôs definitely not me. This diffuser is a waste of money and I will not be buying one from this company again.
5,16-Nov-18,1,Not my favorite...was hoping for something to fill the room... This candle does not last long I'm. I t has a very light scent.
5,30-Oct-20,4,Very nice scent - lasts several hours. This soy candle has a nice scent and did not give me a headache.  The candle burns slowly and would make a great gift.  The packaging is beautiful with the wooden top.
5,12-Jan-20,5,"Fabulous Scent I absolutely love this scent. I light two of them, close the bathroom doors, fill up the jacuzzi, and RELAX. Just wish they were more reasonably priced."
5,14-Jul-19,5,Beautiful and Lovely Scent Burns clean with a soft lovely scent. Caution.  As with all candles they burn hot so please monitor carefully as the container becomes very hot
5,24-Jul-19,4,"Great candle! This candle smells great! One complaint is it‚Äôs hard to get the wax out of the bottom if you wanted to clean it out, but other than that it‚Äôs a great quality candle."
5,27-May-19,3,"Smell great, but overpriced! I bought 2 to try to help the dog smell in my house. The first 2 weeks they smelled great, but they don't last long. Flipping the sticks will help, but it still doesn't last long. They are extremely overpriced!"
5,17-Feb-20,3,Not worth the trouble The candle smelled of cleaning liquid when I unwrapped it.  And the wrapping was terrible.
5,7-Jul-19,5,Soft wax candle Came nicely packaged and lasted for a long time. I enjoyed the light scent. Will try other scents as well.
5,12-Sep-20,5,"Delicate, long lasting fragrance! Love this candle!! It is sometimes out of stock, so when I found it on Amazon, I bought 2!!"
5,4-Jun-19,1,-- I received it in shards! I want a replacement!
5,3-Mar-20,5,Lovely scent Bought as gift for my son‚Äôs girlfriend. She loves the scent and the frosted glass. Looks elegant.
5,21-Apr-19,5,"Amazing candle I got the ""Balance & Harmony"" scent. It smells nice and has a very nice jar as well. The smell isn't too strong, but I wouldn't keep it in a small room for too long as it can fill a large living room with it's scent in less than 30 minutes. It tunnels a little bit at first and then evens out as you use it more so none of the candle ends up wasted on the sides. It lasted two months with regular use, which I felt was pretty decent for the medium size. I will definitely be trying out more scents and will likely get it as a gift for some friends as well."
5,19-Nov-19,4,"Love these candles... Really love these candles. They smell great, look great, and are a wonderful value."
5,27-Oct-18,5,Wonderful scent Smells so good. Pretty. Could definitely be a gift.
5,3-Oct-20,5,Would buy again. Revising my review. Burned very nicely today. Slow and even. Nice scent. Recommend.
5,3-Jul-19,5,Absolutely removes any smells from the air and last a very long time and the scent does not go away I absolutely love the scent of this candle it burns forever the smell entirely lasted the whole candle
5,13-Nov-18,1,"Smell?? There is NO smell to these candles when burning. I don't like overpowering smells, but I couldn't smell anything at all. I totally wasted my money on these. I should have just gone to an actual store to find something a *tad* stronger!"
5,22-Oct-20,5,"Good scent.  Speedy delivery Actually smells a lot!!  Burns cleanly, scent fills the room within half an hour."
5,14-Jul-20,4,"Great Smell, Doesn't Last Long I purchased this diffuser about two months ago for a half-bathroom. I really like the smell; true lavender, no chemical/artificial smell, and it's still pretty strong.But, the oil is running low, I am already looking to purchase a new one. I can't find a refill for this, which is a shame because I will have to toss the container, which is quite nice."
5,15-Mar-19,5,Peace + Tranquility (Cashmere Jasmine) I am so tired of buying expensive chemical candles.  This smells amazing it last SO long.  I am thrilled with this purchase and a reall good value!  I left this candle on over night a few times & days.  It lasts forever!!!
5,12-Feb-20,5,"Soothing scent This candle has the most soothing scent.  I got my first one as a gift and I had to get more.  Everyone that visited the house wanted to know what brand, what scent and where we purchased it.  It‚Äôs amazing."
5,12-Aug-20,3,Don‚Äôt buy Longevity is not great. Takes a long time to ship.  I wouldn‚Äôt recommend. Plenty of other better options.
5,14-May-20,5,"Best scent and clean burning Love this candle.  More in my cart!  Great relaxing scent, perfect for in or outdoors."
5,2-May-20,5,"I receive every benefit as soon as I lit the candle Light, pleasant and calm scent. Not heavy in the air. Burns slowly. I bought one. I need two more."
5,17-May-20,4,"Wonderful scent Love the smell. But it wasnt very strong and didnt last as long as i wouldve liked. Good product, none the less."
5,8-May-20,5,Fantastic Scent This candle is a fantastic scent that's lovely but not overpowering. Long lasting.
5,2-Feb-19,1,Poor quality control on wick placement. Had only burned 2 seperate days and candle went off by itself after 20 minutes if second use.  Wick no where to be seen even after cutting into middle of candle to try to find wick. Realized after cutting off top half of candle the wick seemed to end and restart somewhere off to the side of candle instead of middle.
5,6-Oct-19,5,Would buy again Great scent. Everyone that comes in comments on how good it smells. Would definitely buy again.
5,23-Apr-20,4,"Beware the wick The sent is great and I really liked this candle it was at a fair price. However when you like it the wick turns into a popcorn shape and will pop when you first light it, a little annoying but still a good candle."
5,13-Apr-20,2,"Great sent- BUT First, the sent is really good. With that said, the reason I gave this candle two stars, it is the worse burning candle I ever had. Burns very uneven and when finished, much is wasted."
5,2-Sep-20,5,Packaging sucks; smell is on point!?üíû The packaging will need to be replaced (cardboard) but the smell is beautiful!
5,21-Nov-19,5,Smells amazing!  Good quality for gifts! Smells amazing!  Good quality for gifts!  Im gonna have to buy myself one now!
5,8-Nov-20,5,Wonderful Scent! Trust me you won't be sorry! The scent of this candle is AMAZING! I can't get enough of it. You will not go wrong buying this product.
5,21-Dec-18,5,Loveeeee this candle! Candle smells sooooo nice. I got it for my sister to give to our dad as a Christmas present. I may very well buy one for myself. I got it because My dogs name is chesapeake. Now I‚Äôm in love with it because of the amazing scent. Would definitely buy again
5,7-Mar-20,5,No smell I love Rose scented candles. But this candle has a very subtle smell you can hardly smell it will not order again
5,11-Aug-20,1,Already opened and broken Reused product- obvious by torn label on from and arrived broken . Extremely disappointed and not impressed than a pre-opened product was sent
5,27-Jul-18,5,Last a long time I like the smell. Came great condition nothing broken. Wrapped in bubble bag. It's a strong nice smell that will last long and through our the house .
5,5-Jan-20,5,Great scent! I got this candle for my sister for Christmas. The scent is amazing! She loved it.I'm not sure about the longevity or aroma it gives.
5,21-Apr-20,4,"Fragrant Was a gift. Recipient enjoyed scents, but scent would fade somewhat quickly."
5,27-Jul-18,5,Our favorite candle! One of our favorite candles. Burns even and not too fast. Smell is great and not overly potent.
5,20-Jul-19,5,Looks high end. Good candle. Nice glass jar and real wood top. The scent is what you would expect. It burns pretty quickly. I use it for an Airbnb so am not sure how often it is lit but surprised to see it half burned. Would buy it again.
5,25-Feb-18,4,"Love this candle Love this candle! Smells great and has a really long burn time. It takes a little while to get burning, but once it makes the whole room smell great."
5,1-Jan-20,2,Do not buy. I love the chesepeake bay candle line but i do not like this scent. im sensitive to smells so this candle did not smell good to me at all. Do not buy!
5,26-Jan-20,5,"YAS LOVE these! I bought two and already need to buy more. I love my place smelling good and have been on an epic search for the right candle, the joy + laughter ones throw scent really well, not overpowering, and you don't even have to light it to be able to smell it. Just take the lid off."
5,23-May-20,5,amazing it smells amazing and lasted for 5 days of burning (i always burn a candle nonstop when i first try a brand)
5,4-Aug-20,5,"Worth it! Nice look and feel, nice scent! I wish it melted more evenly but I would buy again!"
5,9-Mar-19,5,"Great value, beautiful home fragrance This is a great value, it has a relaxing, delicately balanced fragrance that smells like it could cost much more. Someone in my office has it and I had to get it! Solid glass jar fees premium too."
5,18-Nov-20,2,"Does not smell like lemongrass or eucalyptus. It smells floral, and nothing like lemongrass or eucalyptus.  I have purchased other candles from this company, and they were very good."
5,30-Mar-20,5,"Smells AMAZING! Smells AMAZING! Not too strong or weak, just right. I‚Äôll be buying again."
5,11-Jan-20,4,Nice! Love the light floral scent. Both candles arrived in good condition.I‚Äôll proceed with caution. Kind of worried since I purchased these without reading reviews about the glasses literally exploding. The warning label underneath advises not to light if there‚Äôs less than 1/2‚Äù of wax in the glass.
5,29-Jul-20,5,Great purchase I really enjoy the scent of this candle!! I am so happy I bought it for myself.
5,12-Dec-19,5,Just warm relaxing and takes your mind away I gave this candle to my neighbor as a birthday gift and she just loved it it smells beautiful and it‚Äôs relaxing I need to order a couple for myself.
5,19-Mar-18,5,Smells heavenly Best smelling candle in the world. I‚Äôm a candle freak and this one is the best
5,29-May-18,5,pleasant scent of mint and basil such a pleasant scent of mint and basil.  Love this scent and the diffuser.
5,27-Oct-19,5,My go to! I‚Äôve tried tons of candles over the years and these became my go to. The smell lasts throughout the duration of the whole candle but isn‚Äôt overpowering. Great value for the price
5,11-Apr-18,4,Four Stars Doesn't smell super strong to me but it seems to have a long burn time.
5,28-Apr-20,5,Great gift for my girlfriend Gave this is my girlfriend and she loves it. Great small and comes with a nice holder. Wooden top makes it look fancy!
5,30-Dec-19,3,Scent does not last This Confidence+Freedom candle is in a pretty jar and it smells beautiful but the scent does not burn at all. I prefer my candles to emit their scent and this one does not for that reason only 3*
5,24-Jun-20,3,Smells amazing but burns super fast It smells amazing subtle and refreshing but it burns soooooooooo fast only last for a little over a week after average daily use.
5,15-Sep-20,5,wish they stayed in stock! I LOVE this candle but it's never in stock. I wish I could get a bunch
5,26-Mar-19,5,Love this Candle Beats the pants off anything I‚Äôve ever bought from Yankee Candle. Smells great and lasts forever. Buying more!
5,14-Jan-19,5,"great gift i haven't seen the gift, but my relative LOVED it for her birthday, says the scent is wonderful; she received it within one day and that was with free shipping, not amazon prime"
5,13-Mar-20,5,Great buy! Will buy again! I love the scent of this candle! It lasts a decent amount of time. Definitely would buy again.
5,19-Aug-20,5,"Great scent, cute lid Love the scent, size and the wooden lid. Elegant, simple and clean look."
5,18-Apr-19,3,"Good scent and longevity. The candle fell out of the glass right when unpackaged it (with the wick still attached to the glass).  It was annoying to get the wick back into the candle.  I did it using a long and thin metal skewer.  The wick is not centered in the candle, so it burns unevenly.  Very nice scent and has good longevity."
5,15-Jul-20,2,"Wouldn't stay lit I returned this candle as it wouldn't stay lit, no matter how many times I lit it."
5,14-Jul-20,1,Poor quality It looks decent but the scent diminishes after 2-3 days even tho the bottle is still full
5,29-Oct-20,5,"Balance & Harmony is the best. It's clean, lite & lasts a long time. Burns clean and evenly. Balance and Harmony is my absolute favorite candle. It's clean and lite."
5,22-Nov-20,5,Bath time luxury! This is the perfect bath candle. It‚Äôs so relaxing‚Äîthe scent is light but powerful enough to fill the room. You‚Äôll purchase it again and again.
5,22-May-19,5,Smell wonderful Bought as presents. Both of my sisters loved the smell and wanted to know where I got them so they could get more
5,16-Dec-19,2,No smell Unfortunately this candle produces no smell whatsoever.  Very light scent when not lit.  expected more from an oak moss.
5,2-Jul-19,5,Love I love the smell. I  typically go to bath & body works. I think this is my new favorite.
5,4-Apr-19,5,"Great smell! I usually don't like fruity smells, but the Cranberry Dahila was very pleasant! I made sure to read into taking care of candles before purchasing, so I let the wax melt to the edge of the jar on my first burn and have experienced no signs of tunneling since! I also make sure to trim the wick to a quarter inch before lighting."
5,8-Oct-20,5,"I would recommend this product to friends, long lasting great scent I would recommend this product to friends, long lasting great scent"
5,23-Mar-19,2,"Didn‚Äôt last long Smell didn‚Äôt last as long as I‚Äôd expected, have had other cheap candles give off scent longer. I used a candle warmer."
5,9-May-20,1,"DEFECTIVE CANDLE Received it today. Burned it immediately and realized it burned inappropriately.  To attempt to salvage the candle, I cut out a quarter of the candle to allow for a level burn.  We will see how it goes, but it's unfortunate that a ""new"" product was sold defective."
5,11-Feb-20,5,"Lovely subtle rise scent. This is my favorite scent!  I‚Äôve bought it for myself multiple times, and I‚Äôve even gifted to others who love it as well."
5,4-Jul-19,5,"The scent is great. Pretty, good smelling and so far lasts longer than other candles I have tried."
5,3-Jan-20,5,Crowd Pleaser Love this candle! Safe ingredients and amazing scents. I got this as a gift about a year ago and have bought the same one to give for others as well. They all love it and ask me to light it when they‚Äôre at my house as well!
5,21-Oct-20,2,Scent is too strong This smells like perfume and not natural at all. I have purchased another scent by this company which was lovely.
5,7-Jun-20,1,"Scent is overwhelming I usually love the smell of eucalyptus, but this scent was too strong for me and my family."
5,15-Nov-20,1,"No worth the price Smells horrible, artificial, chemically and like something you‚Äôd get at a dollar store."
5,21-Feb-19,5,"Wonderful aroma It radiates a light aroma - not overwhelming at all and not a ""fake' aroma.  Slow burning also.  would definitely buy again."
5,6-Feb-20,5,Good candle All gifts and were much loved. Very pretty and smells wonderful!
5,11-May-20,2,"it smells SO good but... i absolutely love the smell, but its barely noticeable. the only time i have noticed the scent in my house, was after lighting it when i accidentally left it lit overnight (and its so not safe to do) for like 12 hours. I expected an easier scent thogh. im a little disappointed but if you light it during the day while youre home you will eventually enjoy it"
5,8-Dec-19,5,Super great Really nice candle. Scent is underwhelming but it's still a buy
5,5-Feb-18,5,Bought this as a gift for a friend and she ... Bought this as a gift for a friend and she told me she LOVES it! She lights it up when stressed and the smell is very soothing and calming
5,15-Feb-20,1,Absolutely no scent! Very odd. Returned. Absolutely no scent. Immediately returned. I bought the ‚Äúpeace and tranquility‚Äù candle and was shocked that even up close it had ZERO smell. Very odd. I regret switching it up and trying these. Going back to my usual lavender oil and wax candles I‚Äôve been buying on amazon (which are also cheaper!).
5,7-Jun-20,1,"Waste of money. Waste of my money.  Love the scent, but burns straight down the wick, leaving almost an inch of wax around the glass from the top down."
5,2-Jan-20,5,"Enjoying this candle I enjoyed this candle for the 1sr time today. Curious  - when I received the candle, it was enclosed in Yankee Candle packaging. Might order again, but would like to see the price go down a little."
5,9-Nov-20,5,Burns without alot of harsh smoke Love how these candles burn. No smoke and smell is really wonderful.  I would purchase again
5,27-Oct-20,5,"Fresh, strong and amazing! I bought a 3 wick and single wick. Both are AMAZING. The smell is fresh, it last and not overbearing. Heck, I‚Äôd even settle for stronger but I love eucalyptus!"
5,17-Sep-18,5,Five Stars Bought as a gift and she loved it
5,6-Jan-19,4,Smells great! The medium is small like a small coffee cup with no handle. It smells really good but I should have got the coffee table one for $4 more.
5,2-Mar-20,3,Not very smelly Not very smelly. Had it for a few days and the oils going pretty quick.
5,23-Apr-20,1,"Has weak scent. I want a candle that you can smell when you enter a room, this one just doesn‚Äôt have an aroma at all."
5,23-Jul-19,3,"Just ok Not that strong of a scent, would rather splurge for nicer brand"
5,14-Mar-20,5,Smelled nice Love this scent. The candle itself lasted maybe 2 weeks and the scent filled a small room.
5,27-Dec-19,3,Simply a nice candle It was a nice candle. Fragrance is nice. The jar seems a little on the inexpensive side. The fresh lavender in the wax is a nice touch. The scent is not over bearing.
5,14-Jan-19,5,Wonderful Candle I purchased several of the Chesapeake Candles for myself and friends for Christmas. Everybody loves them. Soft wonderful scents and long lasting. Definitely recommend.
5,10-Feb-19,1,"Careful Smells great, last long but stains and ruins wood if a drop falls on it. I will still use them but know where I can and can‚Äôt put them"
5,9-Dec-19,5,No smoke Made in jars that basically function as a built-in snuffer so there's no smoke when you put them out ?üëå
5,30-Jun-19,4,Great look Smells decent I honestly just bought the candle cuz it looks really cool and well designed. Nice candle to have for my shelf. No damage or cracks either.
5,22-Jul-19,5,"Pleasant Scent I love this diffuser! I took a risk and purchased this scent - I don't regret it! It is not too powerful, but just clean and herbal enough. I keep it in my bathroom and it constantly puts out a light, noticeable scent."
5,7-Mar-20,5,"So good! This candle smells so amazing. My husband is a chef, and our house always smells like food (not always a good thing). We put this on our kitchen island through the holidays, and omg yes, this candle enhanced ambiance and aroma. Most definitely buying more."
5,13-Apr-17,5,Great Candle I have yet to be disappointed by Chesapeake Bay Candles.  I'm impressed with how strong the smell is without being overbearing.
5,11-Apr-20,2,Way too expensive for what you get Pretty but does not have a grade sent and is way way way too expensive for what you get
5,21-Sep-19,5,"Great scent Nice container, good size and great scent.  I bought it for myself, but wouldn‚Äôt hesitate to give as a gift.  I would buy again."
5,8-Dec-19,5,It smelled good! I bought this for a grieving friend. She said she loved it.
5,8-Jul-19,5,Great scent and price This is the best smelling candle. Everyone loves the scent.  The price is great. Better than some more expensive candles I have bought
5,19-Sep-19,2,Can barely smell it I really wanted to love these candles but I can barely smell them. I wish there was a way to return them even though ive tried them.Came packaged nicely nothing was broken and they are aesthetically pleasing. Just wishing they had a stronger scent.
5,13-Sep-20,5,Good for bathroom Well scent it‚Äôs like bathroom smell so I leave it at bathroom
5,10-Jul-20,5,My fav This is absolutely my favorite scent. It‚Äôs so lovely and yet subtle. I honestly don‚Äôt want anyone to buy it so that it never goes out of stock lol!
5,31-Jan-20,5,Such a lovely scent! I bought this scent in the store for the first time and fell Lin love with its nice and elegant smell. It‚Äôs not too strong but enough to recognize the scent in the room. I couldn‚Äôt find this scent in stores anymore so I had to order on amazon! Will buy more in the future for sure:)
5,31-Oct-19,3,"Underwhelmed Very nice presentation, however I could not smell much at all"
5,4-Oct-19,4,"Fresh This was a birthday gift for a supervisor, she said she loved it so you got a thumbs up."
5,23-Sep-19,5,"‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§ Loved scent, my whole 780sq place smells, ordering again"
5,19-Sep-20,5,"Worth It I'm a huge essential oil, soy,  and aromatherapy scented candles. And this one didn't disappoint ! This particular scent/style is not too over bearing and not too bland and can pleasantly fumigate a slightly more than average size room =)"
5,6-Feb-20,4,Scent isn‚Äôt strong if you want it to freshen a room I‚Äôve ordered previous candles from this company that I LOVED. This candle however left me unimpressed. The scent didn‚Äôt last long or even take up the room.
5,9-Feb-20,5,"Buying another... I love the wooden top. It adds to the gift-ability. I‚Äôve bought 2 and have burned them both down to the glass bottom. Great scent that throws well, I can smell the candle burning throughout the house."
5,27-Jun-19,5,"Perfectly Lovely These are high-quality candles, with a lovely scent. The jar is thick and heavy, and they are long-lasting."
5,26-Dec-18,4,Aroma strength n durability Very strong at first for week enough that it Actually was too strong n made nose itch..2 weeks lada n there is a slight aroma
5,5-Nov-20,5,"Smells AMAZING!!!! I love this candle, it was smaller then I thought but the smell just blew my mind! I did not care whether it was smaller then I thought because I plan on buying another one in a larger size. I LOVE THIS CANDLE!!"
5,24-Nov-20,5,"Awesome Candle I love this candle. The scent is so nice, lasts long, and burns evenly. I would highly recommend."
5,10-Sep-20,5,Beautiful scent. Smells so good and I am hooked. Cant wait to buy more.
5,3-Apr-20,3,Not much scent It's a very subtle scent. I wanted something stronger.
5,10-Apr-19,1,NOT basil OR mint! Does not smell like basil OR mint at all. Very fake and perfumey to me. Not worth the price at all!
5,2-Feb-19,5,great smell! I love the smell of these candles! They burn for a long time too. I'm glad I found them here om Amazon!
5,6-May-20,1,Doesn‚Äôt have scent This candle sucks. It doesn‚Äôt smell like a damn thing
5,12-Jan-20,2,Overwhelming Smell Overwhelming smell. Gave us all a headache - it was too strong.
5,5-Mar-19,5,Nice candle long lasting! Great candle with a room filling fragrance! This one has a light fruity and clean sent. They last for a long time!
5,7-Nov-19,5,Love This is the first soy candle that actually smells great!!
5,23-Nov-19,5,"Fantastic Smell I ordered this candle 11/22 and received it today 11/23! It smells so great, And it‚Äôs bigger than I expected. I originally bought it as a guy gift but after receiving it I am going to keep it Ha! I have not used it yet so I can‚Äôt speak on longevity yet I‚Äôll update on I use it"
5,27-Jan-20,4,"Made by Yankee Candle Company I just love this candle so much that I gave several of these for Christmas presents and everyone absolutely loved them, too."
5,19-Jul-18,2,Not a strong scent Beautiful glass color but the scent just isn‚Äôt there
5,24-Apr-20,5,Smaller than expected but still love I love lavender candles so I had no doubt I‚Äôd love this. Definitely a little smaller than expected because of the price and huge box it came in but the smell is just like lavenders. So far I‚Äôve lit it a few times and seems to a long lasting candle!
5,14-May-20,3,item broken I ordered these candles several weeks ago and when it finally arrived it was broken. Extremely disappointed! They were going to be late Mother's Day gifts and now I have nothing to give them. The scent is beautiful and candles are the perfect size.
5,11-Jan-20,3,Wick partially pulled out. Arrived with wick pulled partially out from the base about an inch. Hard to make it work with no wick at top.
5,23-Nov-20,4,Request double wrap if ordering two or more. Item arrived broken and box was not damaged. Think you should rethink wrapping - ordered two - was not enough bubble wrap or box was too big for two candles.
5,10-Apr-20,3,Not good It‚Äôs not a fresh scent but heavy and muggy. Hard to describe but not pleasant. Wouldn‚Äôt recommend.
5,7-Mar-19,1,Poor Packaging This product arrived completely destroyed. A large glass candle with barely any padding in a box far too large was bound to end up shattered. Poorly cared for considering what it is and was not cheap enough for this to be ok.
5,12-Apr-20,3,"Faint smell This candle smells so good, but then smell is SO faint! It also doesn‚Äôt burn evenly."
5,23-Apr-20,5,So Satisfied! These candles are amazing! I was a little skeptical at first but I'm so glad I decided to give them a try. I use them at night to help me relax and unwind after a long day. The scent is perfect! Not too strong or too lite. They also last burning for many hours. If you are a candle lover as myself you will truly enjoy these!
5,23-Jan-20,4,"Good scent, but strong Nice scent, but overpowering.  My loving room is not huge, but it's s respectable size.  Although I love the scent and it is aesthetically pleasing, the scent is sometimes overwhelming."
5,17-Aug-19,5,"Best Candle Company Out There Every single candle from this company is top quality, I no longer buy any other brands. A+"
5,17-Jan-19,5,descent scented candle im a scented candle...connoisseur..so on a scale of 1 to 10..ill give it an eight..nice frangrance..but a little pricey
5,31-Mar-19,4,Smells amazing! If you like woody scents then you will really like this candle. I personally love woody scents and am a candle freak. It is a little pricey but it does last a while and the smell is so good! It can also be a very nice gift for any of your friends/family who like teak scents.
5,14-Aug-20,5,Beautiful aroma It smells amazing the whole house smells wonderful
5,14-Apr-20,5,Great Scent Great scent and very cute packaging. I got it as a gift for my coworker and she loved it!
5,10-Nov-20,5,They smell good go ahead and try one Decent value for the price they smell pretty good.
5,24-Mar-20,1,Maybe you would like it but I don‚Äôt I do not like the scent of this. I thought I would but I don‚Äôt. I can‚Äôt stand it
5,5-Mar-20,5,Excellent Buy The scent is delicious with a beautiful container.
5,13-Dec-18,5,"Great Scent Love this candle! I bought it for a gift, but would like to purchase one for myself as well. Scent is light and not overwhelming."
5,6-Dec-18,5,Great product Bought these as a gift. Arrived in great shape
5,23-Jun-20,2,"Disappointing This candle is pretty to look at but that‚Äôs about it. When lit, you can‚Äôt even smell it‚Äôs scent. Waste of money tbh. Very disappointed with it."
5,30-Dec-18,1,"SO DISAPPOINTING!!!! I bought 2 of these for Christmas & they smelled AWESOME!! So I decided to buy another, the same smell - Peace & Tranquility Cashmere Jasmine and it has NO SMELL WHATSOEVER !! Guess I'm better off, now I won't buy anymore. Very disappointing!!"
5,1-Oct-20,4,"Smells amazing! The scent is amazing. However, I wish there were refills."
5,8-Jan-20,5,Best candles! Slow burn and amazing smells Love this smell my husband and I have purchased this candle over and over
5,26-Dec-18,5,"Wonderful Smell This was a gift, and they loved the smell! Apparently, Amazon is the only place they can still purchase this candle, which they called their ""favorite candle""."
5,24-Sep-20,5,Awesome product Great price. Thing seems to last forever. Great smell too.
5,2-Apr-18,5,"Lovely scent Love the scent but wish it were a little stronger. Burns clean, no soot"
5,8-Jul-19,3,"3 Marked up: look, convenience.Marked down: price, smell, too narrow."
5,25-Feb-20,5,Great Quality Candle This is and excellent quality candle. Wonderful scent that really fills a room when being used. It is also long lasting. The design is very elegant and fits nicely with many decors.
5,1-Aug-20,5,Smells great but arrived broken! Arrived broken! Someone just put it in a box and allowed to roll around until it broke. So unfortunate because it smells amazing?üòí
5,25-Mar-20,4,Smells good. Candle smells amazing but it does take about an hour for it to be smelled throughout the level of the home.
5,20-Apr-20,5,Smell I was worried that the rose scent would be over powering but it is NOT.  You get the light rose smell that covers my whole bedroom.  I will order again.
5,12-Feb-19,3,"Good for a big room. It is great for living room or big space, but smell is too strong for small room."
5,4-Jun-19,5,"Beautiful Scent The scent Serenity & Calm is my favorite! I've only recently ordered these so can't really say how long they burn, but the smell they give off is heavenly!"
5,11-Sep-19,2,I didn‚Äôt like that scent I got Did not like scent it was package great container was good too
5,27-Apr-20,4,Good Smells good but candle wax burns a little odd.
5,9-Sep-20,2,"Dudas Ordered a few of these candles before, never had a problem. Unfortunately, this time, my candle arrived like this. Obviously unusable."
5,31-Mar-20,5,"Love this candle! I am extremely sensitive to scents and can't burn most candles (or use fragrance), but I LOVE this brand! The scent is light and clean and does not upset my allergies at all. I burn the candle in my den and you can smell it throughout the house, but it is not strong or overpowering. I will order this again and again!"
5,22-Apr-20,5,Love it!!! I was afraid it would come broken but it did not! It was intact. I love the smell of it it‚Äôs very nice. I have it in my bedroom and it smells the whole room and the hallway up. I am definitely buy more this weekend. Love it so much!! Highly recommend!!!!
5,23-Jun-20,3,"Mehhhh This candle reminds me of my Nanas body powder...if you're into that sort of thing. I was looking for more rose, less powdery smell."
5,26-Mar-19,5,"Beautiful scent. Love the scent of this candle. It didn't last as long as I wanted it to and for the price, I won't buy it again."
5,29-Dec-19,5,My fav.. I purchased several of these as many do not have as strong smell yet soft as this does. I will re-order always...
5,3-Sep-19,5,"My favorite candle ever!! This is my favorite candle scent ever! It's a very calming and relaxing, crisp scent. Prepare for your sinuses to be cleared."
5,8-May-20,5,Smells so good and clean. Loved this cancel! Burned it all the way to the bottom. No wax left on the sides.
5,27-May-20,5,Smells great Quality candle. Smells beautiful. Not too strong but refreshing.
5,3-Jun-20,5,Worth the money Great candle love it! Great scent! A must buy! Definitely worth the money
5,10-Jan-20,5,Lovely! Percect hostess gift! Quality modern candle.
5,9-Sep-20,4,Smells good Smells good. Nice spring scent. Good value for money
5,24-Apr-20,2,"Weak Scent The scent diffuser I recieved, Balance+Harmony, looks nice but I can barely smell the fragrance and didn't last long"
5,30-Dec-19,4,"Smells great! Smells good, seems to have a shorter life."
5,9-Dec-19,3,Not what I thought I used it for leisure. I love candles but was a little disappointed in this candle. Once you start burning the candle It takes awhile before you can actual smell the scent of the candle.
5,22-Jul-18,3,Three Stars Doesn‚Äôt really put out an aroma. Very little smell.
5,23-Jul-20,5,"Smells Heavenly! One of the best scented candles out there. Love, love, love!  Highly recommended."
5,16-Jan-20,2,No smell! So I‚Äôve now been burning this candle consistently throughout the day for a few days now and I can‚Äôt smell it AT ALL. There is no scent unless I put my face directly up to it. I only gave it two stars because the frosted glass is pretty.
5,14-Oct-19,2,"Does not smell like lemongrass or eucalyptus Bought Awaken + Invigorate (Lemongrass Eucalyptus) and it smells like soap, but not in a good way. I wanted a spa like smell that was refreshing and lemongrass and eucalyptus would be perfect scents but it doesn't smell like that at all. Kind of smells old ladyish."
5,23-Jan-19,4,Not Strong Aroma I really like the look and the smell of Balance & Harmony..I just wish that it was stronger.  .
5,14-Mar-20,5,Peaceful I‚Äôm absolutely in love with this scent. So calming and sweet.
5,28-Feb-20,5,love this candle It was packed well in an eggcrate type container and box.Smells great and great price! Would buy again
5,11-Jan-19,5,Love this candle! I gifted this candle over and over again over the holidays after buying one for myself. I love this candle and the way it fills the room with an enjoyable scent.
5,28-Oct-20,5,Great for a gift. Great but won‚Äôt last long. Smells divine
5,17-Jul-19,4,#NAME?
5,21-Jun-20,2,"Very pretty, but received damaged in transit. The actual candles were damaged, so had to return them."
5,19-Oct-19,1,"Candle EXPLODED blowing glass everywhere DO NOT BUY. This candle EXPLODED. It was nearing the bottom but still burning when suddenly the glass bottom exploded out, shattering the container. THIS SHOULD NOT HAPPEN. The scent was average to begin with, but now I will not purchase more of these as it is a hazard!"
5,30-Sep-20,1,Glass half empty The wax wasn‚Äôt filled in the entire glass.
5,15-Dec-19,5,"Calming Purchased as a gift, receiver loves them"
5,17-Apr-19,2,No Scent The look of it is great and very elegant however I can‚Äôt smell a thing unless I pick up the candle and sniff. Maybe I‚Äôm used to Bath and Bodyworks aromatherapy candles hitting my nose and all around my house within a matter of minutes. I need to smell more aromatherapy/essential oils.
5,29-Apr-20,2,"Burns Fast, Smells great. I love candles and I was feeling a little stressed so I purchased this one. The life of the candle was not very long lived, and the glass even cracked. I did however enjoy the sent it was not overbearing but strong enough that you can smell it in the entire room which is nice."
5,26-Feb-19,5,Great gift I bought this as a gift so I don‚Äôt know what it smells like or anything
5,19-Apr-20,5,Love It Love the scent.  It's relaxing and subtle.

5,2-Oct-20,5,Relaxing Relaxing scent that last 3 days straight
5,12-Jan-20,5,It burned! It did exactly what they say it would. It burned and smelt great. It's a candle.
5,16-May-20,3,Not what I hoped It is nicely packaged candle but I don‚Äôt smell anything! I don‚Äôt want anything that is too strong but this is almost the complete opposite! I was really excited by it so I‚Äôm very disappointed!
5,12-Jan-20,5,"Smells good I love the smell. Very clean, crisp and relaxing."
5,13-Mar-20,5,"A must have?üòä This is the best candle I ever had! For a little candle, it makes my apartment smell so good."

5,22-May-20,2,"Pricey, no roses here These were pretty pricey. The fragrance was nice enough (if a mite cloying), but it wasn't even remotely reminiscent of roses."
5,14-Oct-18,5,Smells amazing I loved the smell. This was for my baby shower and I almost didn't want to give this away because it smelled so amazing. I am going to buy one for myself for my room
5,28-Dec-18,5,"Great scent, long lasting My favorite candle in recent years.  Great calming scent.  A little expensive for the size but you will not be disappointed"

5,6-Oct-19,1,ZERO Scent!!! Don‚Äôt waste your money The candle has absolutely ZERO scent. The candle was suppose to have a tobacco/cedar smell. I left it in my bathroom with the door shut and still couldn‚Äôt smell it.
5,23-Oct-20,4,Great Smell great smell but lime is really strong
5,11-Jun-20,5,Love this candle Not much to say honestly besides it smells great. It's not too powerful though so I recommend getting more than one if you want this to fill your whole house.
5,15-Mar-20,3,"Need stronger scent! I bought the water lily, pear combo and the pear made it a little sweeter than I would have liked. It‚Äôs not that strong of a scent in my bathroom :("

5,13-Feb-20,1,No scent So disappointing I wanted to love these but barely smelled the scent.
5,20-Jan-19,3,"nice packaging, non existing smell Jasmine smell is among the rare smells that I enjoy and doesn't give me headache. The reviews really encouraged me to get this one but was very disappointed when I got it because it has very fading weak scent. It does not add anything to the room"
5,28-Apr-19,3,If looking for a heavy scent this is not the candle for that A pretty candle however there was not much of a scent to it and does not last very long.
5,29-Mar-19,2,Can‚Äôt smell it very much Not to find if this fragrance.  Hardly smells up the room.  Can‚Äôt tell it‚Äôs even lit  I have seven other candles from here and they were fine.

5,3-Oct-19,5,yummy smell a little small but smells great!
5,13-Jan-19,2,"Only a 3 wick candle, NOT a 4 wick It states in the ad that it‚Äôs a 4 wick candle, which in fact is only a 3 wick candle. It is set up for a fourth wick , so itburn oddly.  The scent is pleasant."
5,18-Nov-19,5,Smells great Smells great burns kinda fast but great for the price
5,16-Oct-19,5,Long lasting Longer lasting candles than traditional wax candles.
5,12-Jan-19,5,Great Gift! Got this as a gift for a male friend and he loves it! He says the smell isn‚Äôt to overpowering and looks great.

5,5-Jan-20,5,great product the candle has a great smell and my daughter loves it
5,22-Dec-19,4,Needs better packaging Great smell but wasn't super potent. Also the packaging could have been a lot better. Was kind of floating around in this cardboard holder. Also slightly smaller then I had expect but overall good product
5,31-Jan-20,5,Amazing Scent My mother loved this candle. Fast delivery and a great gift. It burns for a good while and the scent fills the room.
5,19-Nov-20,5,Review It was a gift and she loved it
5,21-Feb-20,3,"Quality Product/Horrible Scent I bought the ""awaken"" scented candle and did it ever awaken me...to an overly florid overpowering aroma.  Too bad because the presentation/quality are 5 star...wish they made a pine scent."
5,12-Aug-19,3,Not A Fan I personally don‚Äôt like the smell. It smells like beer.

5,5-Jan-20,3,scent doesn‚Äôt last long Displays lovely but scent doesn‚Äôt last long
5,22-Sep-19,5,Perfect gift Smells great and perfect for a gift
5,31-Dec-18,4,Love the scent! I bought the joy and laughter candle for my sister in law and she and I both loved the scent! The first order I received the candle was shattered in a million pieces but the return process was quick and easy. I had the replacement within a few days and was very pleased!
5,14-Dec-19,1,REED DIFFUSER I was extremely disappointed in this product. It comes with a hazard warning of skin and eye irritation. It appears to be an inexpensive liquid with a very slight unpleasant fragrance that is not at all what I expected.
5,2-Oct-20,1,"Stay away Cheap wax, doesn‚Äôt burn evenly. Buried the wick within the first 2 mins. Wouldn‚Äôt buy again. Idk why it‚Äôs even on the Amazon recommended list!"
5,7-Mar-20,5,"Lovely Very nice , will buy again"
5,23-May-19,2,"Perfumy I don't care for the smell of this candle. It's more like perfume than flowers, not something you'd smell in nature."
5,26-Dec-18,5,smells great and burns for a long time Great candle for the pricing. Smells great and lasts for a good while. Will definitely be purchasing these again.
5,8-Jan-20,5,"Great Candle Great candle! I bought several and discovered that I didn‚Äôt need to burn them all at the same time because the scent is powerful. I wish it lasted longer, but don‚Äôt we always wish for that?!?!"
5,3-Mar-20,5,Love it! One of my favorite scents ‚ù§Ô?è
5,6-Nov-20,2,Looked like it had been used. Looked like it had been used. The wicks had already been burned and the wax was below what it should have been. I‚Äôm afraid the scent was much less than I expected. Reminded me of a candle that had sat around with the top off. I was so disappointed.i probably wouldn‚Äôt order another one. Maybe this was a fluke.
5,29-Oct-19,5,Candke My own use love the smell & Hiw lo g it lasts

5,19-May-19,5,Happy customer Smells wonderful. Love it
5,7-Dec-19,4,"Smells like soap I love these candles, specifically the joy and laughter one. I bought this one on a whim and was shocked it smelled like soap when we got it. it still smells good, just not what we expected."
5,22-Oct-20,2,"Overpriced!!!These are the equivalent to four or five tea lights stacked on top of one another. These candles are extremely small for the price. If they were priced accordingly they might be worth it but considering the price and the size of these candles, definitely not worth it!!! They're not much bigger than four tea lights stacked on top of one another."
5,19-Aug-20,2,No smell This candle doesn‚Äôt have a intense or much of a smell while burning. Bit disappointed
5,1-Oct-20,5,Good scent This candle smells amazing

5,5-Oct-20,2,"I can barely smell it ! I was very excited to get this in the mail, but to my dismay, after +5 hours of burning it, the scent was still weak and barley was noticeable :(.  It might be because of the scent I chose. which was peace+tranquility, but im still very sad"
5,25-May-19,5,Must Every woman needs this to relax stress free day
5,29-Apr-18,5,"Strong scented candles that last a long time! I ... Strong scented candles that last a long time! I buy the Balance + Harmony and the Peace + Tranquility and they both give off a masculine, soft smell."

5,3-Feb-20,5,Linens Item as described.
5,6-Aug-20,3,"Love the smell, hate the smoke I love the scent of these candles. They are very relaxing and really fill the space. But the smoke that comes along with them is off putting and the wick is not the best"

5,10-Apr-20,3,"Meh It's a candle, smells nice..."
5,19-Feb-19,1,"oil diffuser no smellÔºÅ bought the oil diffuser and was very disappointed. it doesn‚Äôt have any smell, which defeats the purpose.  maybe the candle is better since most reviews are for the candle. Wouldn‚Äôt spend $20 on the diffuser."
5,23-Jun-20,5,"meh Scent is good, doesn't last long"
5,15-Jul-19,2,"Not really strong Not as good as I expected. Very subtle scent and it's not much stronger when burning. A bit disappointing, but it was cheap."
5,14-Jul-19,1,"Would have bought something else I can barely smell it, even when I light it up"
5,13-Oct-19,5,Glad I chose this. Very pleased with all of these qualities. Would definitely buy again.

5,23-Apr-20,5,Lavender delight Smells heavenly!  Very relaxing
5,24-Dec-19,1,Looks used Was a gift. I had to go buy another candle due to it looked like a candle I pulled out of my closet. The wood top looks like a razor blade cut the wood cover.

5,19-Aug-19,5,nice scent  hope it last a while nice sent- hope it burns for a while
5,1-Jan-20,2,Quality I did not like this at all. Could hardly smell the scent.
5,11-Mar-20,5,Perfect She loves them
5,24-Dec-18,5,Like this scent but everyone has their own opinion I like the scent of this candle and I found it at target first and then bought them on here. Pretty relaxing scent and not overwhelming.
5,13-Mar-20,3,Tunneling... I like the look and scent. But the tunneling of this candle is disappointing. It makes it harder to get a full use out of it.
5,27-Feb-20,5,Best candle ever! My favorite candle!
5,17-Feb-20,5,Ambience Relaxing beautiful scent!
5,27-Sep-19,5,Love I‚Äôve purchased these many times. They smell fantastic and I do feel they change the energy for the better in the house while they‚Äôre burning.

5,23-Mar-20,4,Smelled good and Lasted a long time. Smelled good and Lasted a long time.
5,20-Nov-18,1,"Missing Wick I opened this gift so excited with the smell, but the wick is halfway down the candle. Not even able to light it if someone tried. This was a timely gift that I will be unable to give now because of the defect. Highly upset, especially knowing this is a good company."
5,3-Feb-20,5,Great purchase Love the scent
5,28-Mar-19,1,"Scentless (Simplicity + Hope) Looks nice, but absolutely no fragrance at all. I *simply hoped* that the diffuser would give a nice, neutral yet pleasant  and minimal scent to my tiny office. I can't smell anything when I stick my nose directly above the bottle that arrived with the diffuser."
5,4-Jan-20,3,"Cute diffuser, I won‚Äôt choose scents online again though I liked the looks of this diffuser. It‚Äôs pretty and current, but I made a poor scent selection. The scent was too strong in my small office and apparently contains something that is an allergen for me. I gave it to a coworker who loves it though!"
5,7-Mar-20,5,Very relaxing. The smell is wonderful and after a while it is relaxing...guess I use it too much and before I know it the large jar is almost empty.
5,26-Feb-19,4,"kinda ok ok to look at, haven't burnt yet"
5,12-Mar-20,4,Very nice Candle smells so good
5,9-Jun-20,2,Packaged nicely shipped fairly quickly but the scent is not quite what I expected Scent seems off
5,1-Aug-19,1,"Received wrong size candle I received the wrong size candle. On top of that, instead of just sending me the bigger size candle that I originally ordered they are making me send back the small candle as well. The scent is so strong I can only light it for a little bit and I do not like the scent at all."
5,10-May-19,5,Reed diffuser. Love Chesapeake Bay products. The scent is not overpowering.  Very calming. It's my go to brand whether it's a reed diffuser or candles.
5,11-Mar-19,3,Doesn‚Äôt smell that great The candle did NOT smell as good as I thought it would.... smells kinda odd
5,7-Dec-19,1,No Smell No Smell! 3rd Candle this week that I bought for a gift...that I had to Return!!!
5,19-Jul-20,3,candle scent not very strong
5,22-Feb-20,5,Great scent! Absolutely love this ‚ô•Ô?è scent. Will be ordering again. I really like this brand. I've been happy with all the candles from this company.!
5,3-Mar-20,5,Will buy again Nice scent
5,10-Feb-20,5,Get this! Good value
5,4-Oct-20,5,Scented candle Nice smell
5,27-Jul-19,5,"Strong & long lasting Second time buying this candle! Love the scent and it is very strong, makes my whole house smell great!"
5,25-May-20,4,Buy something less expensive. Way insufficient longevity for the price.
5,13-Sep-20,3,Nice smell but not strong The smell is pleasant but like other reviews say it‚Äôs not very strong. I was looking for a more affordable option so decided to try this one out. The old adage you get what you pay for holds true here.
5,3-Mar-20,3,Good for a short cocktail party Lovely smell but not long enough lasting. Good for short term
5,31-Aug-20,5,"Very Subtle As one used to more aggressive scents, this came as a pleasantly surprising gentler scent. Doesn't overpower, yet may take an hour or more to allow scent ""permeation"", however subtle, throughout an area (about 5'x8').Enjoy!"
5,22-Oct-19,5,The smell is ok the smell is ok not my favorite but it's nice

5,24-Sep-19,1,"No Scent like Other Reviews Said Love the look and it is slow burning. However, there was practically no scent. I bought because so many reviews said scent was wonderful."
5,11-Dec-19,2,Embarrassingly wrong wick size The mushroom carbon on the wick is indefensible from a company that only sells candles. It is Impossible that they do not know they used the wrong size wick.
5,19-Feb-20,5,Great product Smells fantastic
5,8-Aug-18,5,"Elegant Very elegant style for the container. The color is more ""masculine"" and matches my husband's office. The fragrance is very pleasant and not too much tobacco in the scent."
5,20-Dec-19,5,Smells great These candles are so nice they smell amazing and they burn super slow
5,16-Dec-19,5,Love Love
5,27-Sep-19,5,Heavenly Seriously my favorite candle out there. I originally purchased one at target and loved it so much I bought three more here.
5,23-Aug-19,3,Not enough fragrance Not enough fragrance
5,19-Nov-19,4,"We like strong aromas. Good scent that is strong,  lasts long, may be a little over priced for the quantity."
5,2-Mar-20,5,The price Love the scent
5,17-Feb-20,5,I gave it as a gift I like the container and the color.
5,11-Jan-20,5,Good Quality for Price We bought joy and laughter and it smells so good. So sweet and subtle and it really does make the whole room smell good.
5,26-Sep-19,1,No scent Very little scent

5,15-Jan-20,5,Great candle for the price Got as a Christmas gift for my significant other and she loved it. It smells amazing and seems to have lasted a very long time. Strong scent. Will definitely purchase again. They also look very nice and are a great gift.
5,29-Mar-20,4,Pretty okay candle Scent is a light refreshing but the candle does not have a powerful Enough throw to fill a nyc studio. Wish it was a bit smellier because scent is so great. Would maybe get again.
5,14-Feb-19,1,"Smells Horrible, very Disappointed ‚ò?Ô?è Purchased based on the reviews, I Love Lavender and was so excited once received. To my disappointment, the candle smells horrible. I had to blow it out, wasted money ?üò¢"
5,19-Dec-18,5,Classy I like the soft color on this glass and also that it‚Äôs fairly thick.  No flimsy plastic materials.
5,10-Sep-20,2,Disappointed I can barely smell the scent when I burn the candle.
5,9-Jul-20,5,i love it! i love this candle(: its really cute packaging and it smells super good. its really calming and it makes me feel like im in a yoga studio (in the best way)
5,12-Jun-18,3,Not much aroma These are pretty and nice packaging but not much aroma.  Would not reorder for that reason.
5,21-Nov-19,5,Great aroma from a long-lasting candle I buy a lot of different candles on amazon and this one just became my regular brand. Smell lasts long and is great! Not overpowering but just enough to fill a room.
5,15-Apr-20,5,Smell‚Äôs good These are nice little candles.  Smells good. Good price.
5,17-Jan-20,4,A little bit expensive but smells great! A little bit pricey but I Love the smell of this candle.
5,1-Jun-19,1,"Barely Any Smell Disappointed as the reviews were good. I love candles but this barely has a scent or smell, even after burning over two hours and placing in my bedroom to see if it would be stronger in a smaller room. Not worth the price!"
5,29-May-19,5,Smells wonderful! I loved the scent. It was very refreshing and always made my room smell more pleasant. It lasted me 2 or so months so it was totally worth it. Such a fantastic gift basket item!
5,7-Apr-19,1,They smell and not in a good way. Dislike the smell. They stink. My teens can't stand the smell and I have to agree. Do not care for the scents at all.
5,19-Feb-20,4,ok air freshener
5,13-Oct-20,4,Excellent for Gifting This makes for a beautiful gift and has a calming fragrance unlit (this is for a gift). The price is excellent!
5,14-Jul-20,4,So-so scent Nothing spectacular
5,7-Feb-20,5,"My favorite Candle LOVE this candle scent and price! I have purchased this candle numerous times and the quality and scent is just as great every time. If you need a scent to help you relax or cleanse your environment, this is a great choice. I usually recommend this candle to friends who want a long lasting candle that is reasonably priced."
5,27-Dec-19,3,"Chemicals in wick leave a residue on everything It was a good buy,Smokey burn that leaves residue."
5,15-Jun-20,1,Used Product The product arrived used with the shipping  label stuck to it. The candle also comes out of the jar if you turn it upside down. It smells good though.
5,30-Sep-19,5,Nice Nice
5,10-Jan-20,5,"Beautiful scent The smell is great! Also, the candle burns cleanly."
5,20-Mar-19,3,They‚Äôre good! Good candle. Burns quick though.
5,10-Jan-20,5,Great value!!! Best brand ever. Have been burning my candle for about 20 hours and have only used almost half of it. GREAT VALUE FOR YOUR MONEY!!
5,11-Apr-19,5,Smells wonderful I love the smell and no sooty smoke. Just wish they were a little less expensive.
5,26-Feb-20,1,Fire hazard Everytime you re-light this candle it will shoot little pieces of hot black wick about a foot in every direction! For the price I would‚Äôve got a yankee if I knew... ignore the good reviews.
5,31-Oct-19,5,"Smells amazing! Smells incredible and is a very strong scent, so you can make it last for a long time!"
5,12-May-20,5,Smells great I wish it was less pricey but it was worth it. Smells great except this allergy season is not helping
5,16-Oct-20,5,Cute and efficient Love the frosted glass. Lovely faint smell. I use it daily for hours and it's still going. Good value
5,23-May-19,5,"Solid product. Smells lovely. Great product that lasts as long as a candle should. Stop being candle critics, this is koala-t. Smells nice and looks sleek. Great gift tool"
5,29-Oct-20,5,Soothing Great for relaxing
5,2-Jan-20,5,HIGHLY RECOMMEND! Absolutely love these candles! I always keep a couple in my room!
5,12-Jul-20,5,lovely Very nice
5,1-May-19,5,"Loved this candle!!! My favorite so far!!! Just a beautiful, elegant, soothing and sophisticated smell that puts me at peace.  I absolutely love it!!!"
5,8-Apr-20,1,No scent :( This cancel has no scent so disappointed. :(
5,9-Mar-20,4,Mellow lemongrass Lemongrass scent does not pop. More mellow than expected. Burn time was good.
5,27-May-20,5,Smells good Everyone loves a good candle
5,18-Feb-19,5,Great Fragrance There is nothing I didn't like about this product.
5,5-Mar-20,3,Ok Doesn't have much scent when it burns.
5,20-Feb-20,1,Poor quality.  Bad wick.  No scent! Very poor quality!
5,9-Aug-20,1,"Smells like cheap men's aftershave I found the scent of this candle off-putting, even while it was still in two layers of boxes. It has a repulsive odor, similar to cheap men's aftershave or perhaps Axe body spray. I certainly don't want my house to smell like this... :-/"
5,4-Sep-20,5,"Great Gift I got this for my girlfriend, and she loved it!"
5,19-May-20,2,Too expensive for such little scent Very little scent.
5,4-Oct-18,4,"Great smell, not so great packaging methods. The smell is amazing, however I bought two of them and only 1 came intact. The other one was shipped on it's side and melted into the packaging. I was able to salvage the wax and make it work, but it was quite annoying. After about 20 minutesor so of melting the wax back into the candle it uncovered the wicks and worked."
5,12-Mar-19,5,Best scent ever I love this scent so much. I bought it for my mom for Christmas and ended up buying myself one. So calming and relaxing to have in the air.
5,28-Jan-20,5,Great Candle Smells great
5,2-May-20,5,smelled lovely perfect gift for the mother in-law
5,16-Apr-19,1,"Candle Fraud ? This candle smells like nothing. I put my nose next to it and still nothing. No Jasmine. no cashmere in peace and tranquility. I bought balance + harmony and it had a strong scent. The candle I bought wasn't weak, it was non-existent. Candle looks good though."
5,16-Nov-20,5,"Great Candle Bought candle because it smells like my boyfriend who deployed. Unfortunately, he broke it off with me part way through, so now I'm left with a really long lasting candle that smells like exactly like my ex. Super nostalgic scent, which is why I bought it, but not like this."
5,14-Oct-20,5,Lightly scented candle Lightly scented candle. Is great if that is what you like. Not over powering with fake lavender smell. I like it and would buy it again.
5,8-Jan-20,1,Expectations The scent of this candle didn't live up to expectations. The jar and wooden top are nice.
5,9-May-20,2,Arrived leaking and the scent does not fill the room I was so excited to receive this. I knew that I was looking for something with a lower price point and thought that this would be a great option. The box arrived leaking and the scent does not even fill the room.
5,27-Sep-20,5,Candle Home fragrance
5,20-Jan-20,5,‚ù§Ô?è Love these candles & they burn for at least 2 days
5,6-Oct-19,5,Great product The scent is definitely distinguishable but not overpowering. I have one in my living room and bathroom and love it
5,1-Apr-19,5,"gently scented, looks good These are great candles for a reasonable price. They burn evenly, are gently-scented, and the jars are pretty."
5,24-Sep-20,3,Scent just ok Not a fan of scent
5,12-Feb-19,4,"Good looks n light smell Looks good n classy holder, smell is very light. Good for a gift"
5,20-Feb-20,5,‚ù§Ô?è‚ù§Ô?è Love the smelll
5,10-Jan-19,3,Not as Fragrant I purchased a much smaller candle and immediately fell in love with the scent. The smaller candle did not last very long so I immediately searched a bigger candle of the same fragrance. I was very disappointed that my purchase of the bigger candle was not as fragrant as the smaller container.
5,1-Jun-19,5,Great as a gift Nice scent
5,11-Aug-19,5,Great scent I love the smell of this candle!
5,10-Jun-20,3,"Rose water has no smell Very beautiful appealing candle. Perfect for a gift. Big however is the smell isn‚Äôt strong, it‚Äôs barely there at all"
5,29-Jan-19,5,Not an over powering scent I'm so happy I stumbled upon this candle on Amazon. It smells great and I honestly do feel calmer while it's burning.
5,10-Feb-20,1,No smell whatsoever... I bought this hoping it'd be a good candle and it sucks. I bought another one from bed bath and beyond and when I light that one you can actually smell it. This one doesn't even reach 2 feet away for a scent...
5,30-Mar-20,5,"Very pleased! I really like this candle! It‚Äôs alway a tough call with shopping online for candles, but this one is a true winner! Really pretty looking, simple pretty color. The smell is nice and soothing and makes the whole room smell nice!"
5,14-Feb-20,1,Sorry candle Low to no smell at all.very disappointed.never buy again
5,12-Oct-20,1,Does not burn evenly I just lit the candle for the first time today. The wick burns through the center of the candle (instead of burning evenly throughout the candle) creating a gorge around the wick and then the wick burns out and you can't light the candle again. Do not buy the large size!
5,10-Aug-19,5,"Perfect blend Do you ever feel a little unbalanced? Perhaps in need of a little more harmony? If so, then I highly recommend this candle. It is the perfect blend of balance and harmony wrapped into one unique candle. 5/5 would purchase again if ever feeling unbalanced."
5,7-May-20,2,Too strong scent! Very very strong scent! Not for home! Maybe bathroom!
5,3-Jun-19,3,Strange smell The scent is a little reminiscent of walking into a public bathroom - it‚Äôs not super pleasant but it‚Äôs not terrible
5,8-Aug-20,3,Clean burning wick Scent not strongLiked clean burning wick
5,2-Sep-19,3,Not my favorite Overall it was okay. The scent was not my favorite. I am more fond of their other scents.
5,14-Jul-20,5,"Love the scent! Super relaxing scent. I love it. I've bought it in 3 different sizes, would highly recommend the coffee table size. The other's don't last long."
5,10-Jan-20,5,Smells nice and good throw Nice scent. Buying a second one!
5,4-May-19,5,Great scent! Great scent and it looks great in my office.
5,31-Dec-19,5,Smells great! Very pretty! Smells great! Very pretty!
5,25-Jun-19,2,"Doesn‚Äôt gives off a scent Doesn‚Äôt work, it‚Äôs more decoration than anything."
5,7-Jun-19,5,The scent is sooo wonderful?üòä Love this candle!
5,24-Aug-19,5,"Pleasant scent Thank you, a great pleasant refreshing scent."
5,23-Oct-19,5,Great gift Great gift
5,7-Oct-19,5,Amazing I love these candles! These are my go to candles. They have strong smell that isn‚Äôt over powering but will fill the room. They are my favorite and I love the little messages on the outside.
5,12-Jul-19,5,The scent They smell divine and last and last !
5,7-Jan-19,3,"Annoyed by lack of refills I love our diffuser, it smells great, and it looks nice, but I'm very annoyed that there is no way to refill it."
5,17-Feb-19,5,Looks and smells great! I like the way this product looks and smells. The scent is nice and not too strong. I will order this again soon.
5,9-Aug-19,5,Gift Gift
5,8-Jun-20,5,Nice Candle Looks great and smells great! I like that it comes with a lid.
5,31-Dec-18,5,Fresh scent Very nice candle...the scent is very clean and fresh! Will order 6 more!
5,21-Sep-20,5,Love the scent Great Candles
5,16-Apr-20,1,Mad I spent $10 ?ü§¨ This candle was horrible...the waxed burned right down the middle in less that 10 minutes...defective
5,21-Jan-19,5,Purchased as gift Receiver was happy
5,19-Mar-20,5,Perfection Love this candle! It smells amazing and has lasted me over a week now. Highly recommended!!
5,29-Mar-19,3,"Spend more, Get more... These look nice but don‚Äôt have much scent. ‚ÄúNest‚Äù candles spoiled me."
5,19-Feb-20,5,Wonderful Love
5,14-Sep-20,5,nice scent burns well I received this as a gift and I love it! The smell isn't overbearing its nice and just strong enough. The glass container is pretty lavender color. It does have natural bubbles in the wax so occasionally you will hear a 'pop' as the wax heats/ melts.
5,31-May-19,5,Sweetness Aroma I got this as a valentines gift for someone. It smells suppper gooood. It is a super sweeet scent so if that isn‚Äôt your thing it is not for you but if you love a sweet scent this is amazing. Every time I smell it I‚Äôm just ‚Äòahhhhh‚Äô ‚Äòemmm‚Äô
5,2-Jul-20,5,Great price. Especially the pack of two candles This is one of the best candles I have purchased.I would give it as a gift.The scent is very light and calming
5,2-Apr-20,5,Love it Got this for my moms birthday and I liked it so much I got one for myself!
5,6-Oct-19,5,Lovely 3 pack! My guests loved these candles.  They were given in a gift basket and were enjoyed!
5,15-Oct-19,5,Amazing smell! Love love love the smell of this candle! Perfect for an everyday smell to lighten the room. My boyfriend also loves it and he‚Äôs not a huge ‚Äúscent‚Äù guy!
5,18-Jan-19,5,Great smell Smelled really good. Gave it as a gift and receiver really enjoyed it.
5,11-Apr-19,2,"Smell what? Fairly worthless candle. It burned all the way through well enough, but the scent was hardly distinguishable."
5,17-Jan-20,3,Not A Buy Can't smell this candle.  If anything smells like wax.
5,3-Apr-19,5,Delightful fragrance Loved the fragrance and it burned much longer than I anticipated.
5,30-Oct-18,3,Okay !!! I like it  but I thought I would  be able to smell the scent much better then I can
5,16-Aug-19,4,Great candle Really like as it lasts a long time and isn‚Äôt a pretty jar. Not my favorite scent but still a great candle.
5,22-May-19,5,Smells great Freash
5,19-Jul-19,3,Does this look right to you? I received the candle and it appears to be missing a lot of wax. Did anyone else experience this?
5,19-Feb-20,4,Burns! Smell is tolerable
5,27-Apr-20,5,Good Highly recommend
5,25-May-19,4,"Off-center wick Stillness + Purity (Rose Water) has a great scent that's very calming, but the one I got has a very off-center wick.  It must be about an entire centimeter off-center, leaving one side un-melted even when burned for a whole 4 hours."
5,18-Feb-20,1,the jar is broken... the jar is broken while using...
5,5-Oct-20,4,I will purchase more Like the container and smell
5,23-Jun-19,4,"It's a candle It burned, it smelled nice."
5,11-Mar-20,5,Strong scent Fresh summery scent
5,16-Feb-20,5,"Great find I have been buying candles from BBW and Yankee which are expensive, these candles are not and smell and burn way better than those other brands. I will be be purchasing many more of these in the future!"
5,31-May-20,4,"So enjoyable / relaxing ‚ù£Ô?è I lite this candle went to shower, when I came back to the bedroom. Aww did it smell. A soft gentle smell. I love it. Definitely a buy again‚ù£Ô?è"
5,5-Jun-18,5,Five Stars Chesapeake Bay candles are rhe best and burn smoothly. I have purchased several and love them all.
5,24-Mar-19,3,nice candle scent is a little strong for me...I gifted it
5,14-Dec-19,5,My favorite candle Great candle. Smells amazing and lasts pretty long. Probably my favorite candle
5,3-Sep-19,5,Nice scent but candle burns quickly Nice scent but candle burns quickly
5,17-Jan-20,5,Relaxing Nice scent.
5,9-Mar-19,1,"Candle broke So I bought this candle based on the great reviews and cause it smelt so great. After being lit for a couple hours, I heard a large smash in my living room. When I turned around I saw that the candle had shattered all over my coffee table with hot wax spilled everywhere. I don‚Äôt have any pets nor was anyone in my house to break this. Never seen anything like this. Beware before you buy this candle."
5,19-Sep-20,2,"Pretty candles but can hardly smell The smell was to too faint. Burned 2 candles at the same time, hardly smelled anything."
5,27-Mar-20,5,Perfect. Great for the price. Smell is perfect not too loud.
5,24-Apr-19,5,Great candle! Slow burning and great scents Great candles! Smell yummy- never overpowering.  Glass lights up for a beautiful ambiance.  Slow burning as well.  I keep coming back and buying different scents- love them! And re-using the holder with pretty wood top ?üòä
5,13-Oct-19,3,Only lasted a month I ordered the lavender scent diffuser. The lavender was a nice fragrance but the oil only lasted A MONTH  Very disappointing!
5,18-Jan-19,5,3 wicked no soot. Bought for my daughter she loved the scent and it burned clean no soot.Perfect for the inside of the house
5,12-Jan-19,5,Great buy This is so nice

5,22-Oct-20,5,"Great scent Smells really good, also very giftable."
5,19-Aug-20,3,"Nice scent, but can‚Äôt smell it Great scent for a guy, but does not fill the room whatsoever. I have this in my medium sized master bedroom and compared to my last reed diffuser you can‚Äôt hardly smell it."
5,20-Sep-19,3,Not worth the money It doesn‚Äôt give off much of a smell when you light it. ‚ò?Ô?è I‚Äôve spent $5 on candles from Walmart that give off more of a smell than this one!
5,5-Feb-19,5,Smells amazing Smells so good
5,7-May-20,3,"Smells great and shipping was fast. I'll say this much... the candle smells amazing and the shipping was great with this pandemic going on. But, there was no wick! I had to dig out the wax around the wick ( which was buired) to light it and keep it lit."
5,3-Mar-19,5,"So great !!! So great ! Nice glass very well made, pretty and candle smells really nice . Will buy again ! ?üòç"

5,11-May-20,1,"Smelled good but arrived broken I was disappointed to find the glass broken when this candle arrived and when I tried to just pull the candle out, the wick stayed anchored to the glass. I don't have a way of returning so it went into the garbage. Disappointed."
5,28-Apr-20,2,"BROKEN don't get me wrong, the scent is AMAZING, however. it came completely BROKEN!! it was shattered so much that i almost couldn't even but the scented oil in. I don't know if you can choose in shipping instructions to be extra  careful but i highly recommend it."
5,21-Oct-19,5,Love the smell. Haven't lit it up yet.
5,19-Dec-19,3,"Great but not long lasting... I bought these candles as a gift for my wife, who loves them.  I liked their look and scents but the longevity seems a little brief..."
5,22-Dec-19,5,"Lovely smell Smells soooo good, came in in one piece."

5,16-Dec-19,5,Great scent Great for gifts
5,20-Jun-18,3,Three Stars It doesn't emit a decent amount of scent.
5,14-Aug-19,5,"Enjoyable all day, every day. I love this scent. Can't wait to buy more but I'll have to wait until it gets a little cooler here in AZ. In general I'm a fruity/flower scented person, so this really hits the spot."
5,8-Dec-19,5,Great gift! Great gift my mom will love it!!!
5,29-Jan-20,3,The quality... The quality of this product is getting worse. I used to love this candle sooooo much but now I‚Äôm questioning their quality. I still like the scent but as candle... hmmm
5,28-Sep-19,1,Broken products. I‚Äôve been sent two candles now. The first was broken. The second was a replacement for the first and it was also broken. Huge disappointment and a waste of my time and money. Don‚Äôt bother buying.
5,27-Feb-20,5,Long burn time Great smelling candle
5,13-Dec-19,5,"Nom Ok. So my favorite snack is frozen strawberries, pineapples, and peaches, you know, like those mixed bag ones.This candle smells like the syrup that‚Äôs left on the plate with a touch of flora.I was gifted one. Bought one. Gifted one.It is legit."
5,24-Nov-19,5,"Buy it. A good friend got this for my new apartment, everyone loves it. It's a manly scent as you would expect, quite nice to fire up when having people over or just lounging around on a cool evening."
5,20-Sep-19,5,Favorite Candle Ever! My favorite candle in the world‚Äî Such a wonderful smell and a great aesthetic for dinner parties. Worth every bit of the money!
5,7-May-19,5,Nice It lasted a few days of constant burning. Smelled very good. Sweet. Will buy again.
5,2-Aug-20,5,"Wonderful. Scent is great and present even when it isn‚Äôt lit. Gorgeous scent, great look, the frosted glass is very complimentary and not crazy when the candle burns. But it, it‚Äôs awesome. I could smell it through the box. I‚Äôve gotten three so far and they last a good while and make great gifts"
5,26-Jan-19,4,Love this candle Smells great!
5,9-May-19,5,love this LOVE IT smells heavenly
5,6-Aug-20,3,"Heavy, oily scent The candle is really pretty, but the scent is heavy and oily smelling. I haven‚Äôt burned it yet, but definitely keep the lid on."
5,16-Oct-20,5,"Candle Smell good, a little tiny for the price but I hope works."
5,29-Dec-18,5,"Great Smell Purchased as a gift . she loves it , thank you"
5,9-Aug-20,1,Where's the wick? The wick lasted for about 45 min then wouldn't burn. We dug out a bunch of wax to try to get it going but to no go.
5,7-Feb-19,5,"Great scent Very nice, even burn"
5,28-Jan-20,5,"A calming constant Ever since I first got this candle, I‚Äôve kept one burning while I work from home. I also got one for my boss for a holiday which she loved."
5,4-Nov-20,3,"Smells good! The scent is good, smells my whole room. It is like a fruity smell, not to overpowering. I would buy again."
5,13-Dec-19,5,Subtle and fresh My favorite scent from this brand it‚Äôs subtle and fresh
5,23-Jun-18,5,Will not disappoint! Other candles lose scent and just are not well made. This candle has an intoxicating scent each time. It is very soothing and stress relieving. I‚Äôm going to buy more of this brand for sure
5,6-Feb-20,5,Perfect match Bought it because of its color but love the scent
5,5-Jul-20,1,"Not worth the price It didn't work, i was only able to smell it if i had it in front of my nose. I asked everyone who comes into my living room if they smell anything they didn't from the first day!"
5,8-Dec-18,1,Wrong Scent The focus+patience is advertised as LAVENDER CLOVE. The actual scent is TOBACCO CEDAR...now my apartment smells like stale cigarettes
5,3-Nov-20,5,Love the Smell of this Candle Love this candle. Don‚Äôt order when hot outside. UPS put my box sideways in the heat of the day and I didn‚Äôt get home until later. Candle still did work and smelled great but was messy from being on it side.
5,20-May-19,5,Muy buen producto ?üëç?üëç?üëç
5,5-Mar-20,4,Good quality candle Great product would buy again
5,10-Oct-19,5,Love I am obsessed with this brand!! I buy so many of these! Rotate scents and each one is fantastic!!
5,5-Feb-19,5,Great smell that lasts Love it
5,17-Jul-19,5,Good Good
5,30-Jan-19,5,pretty Very nice gift
5,17-Aug-20,1,Wick burned down - can't use candle I love the scent of this candle and I have purchased it several times.  The last one I ordered had a defective wick that burned up immediately without actually melting the candle wax.  Very disappointing.
5,23-Oct-20,5,Lasts a long time Smells wonderful
5,15-Mar-19,4,"Soothing Candle Nice candle soothing, the smell is not over barring like some candles, I will definitely try the other scents they have."
5,9-Jan-20,5,Great gift! I love candles and recently got my best friend into loving candles. I bought this for her as one of her christmas gifts and she loved it!
5,21-Jun-19,4,Nice smell Burns great
5,16-Jul-18,5,"Fragrance & Appearance & Package, oh yes ! I enjoyed the fragrance and packaging, as both are excellent.  Endurance burn (Id say) is significantly better than most but have seen better."
5,10-Mar-20,2,"Scent not very noticeable in even a small space, however smelled lovely right under my nose Did not emit much of a smell unless you had the lit candle directly under your nose..."
5,1-Aug-18,5,"How strong the candle smells. The scent  lingers throughout the house, and I really like ?üëç the slow ?üêå burn ?üî•."
5,6-Oct-20,1,Not as expected. Worse. Scent is nothing like described. Smells like cheap Adidas cologne. Very potent and sharp. Sometimes you get strong wiffs. Un-returnable because it has ‚Äúalcohol in the liquid‚Äù.
5,27-Feb-20,5,My Favorite Candle! Love the scent as well as the wooden top which adds a nice touch!  It burns evenly and it‚Äôs soy!  Added bonus that it‚Äôs made in the USA!
5,8-Aug-18,5,Candle Great scent and burn time. Will purchase again
5,10-Feb-19,5,Good gift. Arrived as expected.
5,6-Jun-19,5,Worth the price Perfectly strong clean scent. I love it and will buy more.
5,5-Mar-19,5,smells like comfort! I love the way this smells. It is a very soft scent and the candle burns well. I will definitly order more candles from this company.
5,7-Feb-20,5,Love this scent! Great smell and quality
5,16-Dec-18,3,"Great stocking stuffer, unfortunately... Great company for candles, I'm not a fan of Yankee Candle anymore once I discovered this brand and DW home candles. The scent is crisp and clean and lasts a while. Unfortunately though, I ordered the Peace and Tranquility AND Balance and Harmony...and Amazon sent me two Balance and Harmony."
5,2-Jul-19,5,Good smell it does Smells good
5,4-Oct-20,5,Good The scent is amazing and the candle its self is pretty and good for decor.
5,3-Apr-20,2,Not worth the $ The reeds that came with this do not pull the scent to the top. The scent was gone in 3 days. I replaced the reeds and it works better.
5,4-Mar-20,5,Lasts a long time. Lasts a long time.
5,17-Feb-19,2,"They're ok The smell is great, however after the initial burn the wick will start to mushroom. Thought it might have been just that one particular candle but the other scent I ordered had the same issue. Produces an awful burning ash smell when put out."
5,10-Apr-19,5,Chill Time! Fantastic aroma! A plus to any room!
5,8-Aug-20,5,Love this I love this candle!! Most candles that smell this great are super expensive and don‚Äôt last long! Had to buy two more because my husband stared using them for his baths!
5,25-Apr-19,5,Great candles! Love the smell!!
5,9-Jul-19,5,Great scent and not overpowering. Love! Love! Love!Smells so good and doesn‚Äôt give me a headache.
5,17-Jul-20,5,Feel¬†good Good¬†things¬†worth¬†buying
5,16-Apr-19,2,Can't smell a thing.. I bought this candle because I love the smell of lavender. It was very disappointing that it smells like nothing.
5,21-Mar-20,5,Good value Great scent and lasted
5,25-Mar-19,5,Beautiful scent that is refreshing not overpowering I have ordered this candle before and will order again in the near future. I have a large house and this candle permeates with a beautiful scent without being overpowering. I highly recommend it.
5,24-Feb-20,5,Lovely scent Lovely scent.Keep on getting compliments on this scent.Will buy more
5,1-Feb-20,4,"Smaller than expected The candle is really nice and smells good, I got the love and passion but I expected a bigger candle."
5,22-Dec-19,5,"Love them! Love these, both for bedroom and office. Not too strong and smells clean."
5,12-Oct-19,5,Great Candle This is a quality candle. It has a great sent and very well made. I like the wood top also.
5,2-Jun-19,5,Great Love this scent
5,7-Jan-20,5,Smell is wonderful Love the clean fresh scent
5,11-May-19,2,smell I can barely smell the aroma of the candle. Not the best quality.
5,4-Jan-20,1,Arrived damaged Arrived melted all over the packaging
5,24-May-20,2,Oh hell no smell This candle doesn‚Äôt smell like anything. After burning it for the third time I finally smelled a hint of jasmine. That‚Äôs only because I was really close to candle. I‚Äôm disappointed I‚Äôve had dollar store candles that were better than this.
5,10-Jul-18,1,Quality Control needs work This candle is so badly melted I cannot see the wick.
5,7-Oct-19,5,"Smell Amazing! I honestly only bought these candles because I live in Florida and there was a hurricane coming! However, I am sooo glad I bought them! They smell sooooo amazing! After lighting them I feel like my house smells like a spa! Definitely recommend!"
5,24-Dec-19,5,You cant go rong with yankee candles i love yankee candles they last longer and smell so good a great gift year round
5,10-Jul-19,5,She liked it Perfect gift for wifey
5,30-Dec-19,3,Smells great but candle is weak Not a strong scent when burning
5,25-Oct-20,5,"Great smell im not a candle person, but i just ordered 2 more Large peace & tranquility candles. great smell"
5,9-Oct-19,3,Not recommended It doesn‚Äôt have much  smell.
5,16-Feb-19,5,They don‚Äôt smoke when they are lit. Love theses candles! They don‚Äôt smoke at all.
5,12-Jul-19,4,It doesnt last long loved the scent but it lasted 2 days in my apartment
5,27-Apr-20,4,GREAT SMELL! Great smell! Not overwhelming. Go large size. Small and mediums are not enough.
5,16-Nov-20,3,"Man smell. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs a really nice candle but it‚Äôs definitely dude scented and not just oak moss and amber. It might have said that somewhere, but if not, it‚Äôs being said now :) it‚Äôll make a great gift for my boyfriend."
5,17-Mar-20,3,Faint Scent I typically love this brand of candle however this variety was did not throw the fragrance well at all. Not the same as previous experiences.
5,18-Feb-19,5,Relaxing Smells Great! Great gift!!
5,4-Nov-19,5,Doesn‚Äôt last long Doesn‚Äôt burn as long as they say. But wonderful smell
5,21-Jul-20,1,Only Nice to Look At Do not waste your money if you are looking for a candle that gives off a wonderful scent. This one does not give off any I am so disappointed in this candle. Bath & Body Works and Febreeze candles smells better than this candle and is worth every penny.
5,10-Nov-18,3,"Can‚Äôt even gift this to someone like I intended to... Although it still smells good, it‚Äôs pretty obvious the candle old. The wicks are all messed up and the candle is completely separated from glass."
5,2-Sep-18,2,Not made for each other I actually had to give this away.  Not a pleasant scent at all.
5,11-Jan-19,5,Nice giftable item Lavender smelled great. Gifted to my niece and she loved it. Candle had a nice look to it with the frosted glass.
5,26-Jun-19,5,Good for price Smell fo the candle could be stronger but the candle burns well. Important to use a Wyck cutter.
5,28-Sep-20,2,Nice Pineapple one smells like bathroom spray. Made me think my apartment had poop somewhere.
5,25-Dec-18,4,It‚Äôs a candle Thought it was the taller one
5,3-Apr-19,5,Quite lovely Quite lovely
5,15-Oct-18,5,"Awesome buy - smells amazing! I would repurchase these candles again, without a doubt! They smell amazing, reach a wide range when burning, and are very nicely designed. I love the wooden lids and the scents are great! Buy these!"
5,24-Dec-18,5,It did come in a separate box that could be easily wrapped Awesome candle. It smells good too. A soft smell not overwhelming. Chesapeake Bay is my new favorite. Can't wait to try the other fragrances.
5,20-Mar-20,5,Slow burn so it‚Äôs lasting well. Great candle with fresh nice scent.
5,5-Jan-20,5,Beautiful scent One of my favorite candles
5,15-Oct-20,3,"More of a decorator accessory than fragrances air Lovely color blue and nice neutral fragrance, unfortunately the formula is not potent enough to enjoy when you walk into the room it's being used in. Tried various size rooms and only a small bathroom is affected by the oil."
5,28-Oct-20,1,Came SHATTERED & CAN NOT BE RETURNED Very upset!
5,14-Feb-19,5,Love These candles smell aaaammaaaaaazzing.
5,10-Jun-20,5,Love Love
5,5-Nov-20,5,"Was bad the first time it was lit Just after it was lit, im so disappointed that this happened.  Terrible, I have never had this happen with a candle."
5,14-Aug-20,4,Hurry up and re stock Love them but they are never in stock
5,27-Jan-20,5,"Amazing scent, my fave candle MY FAVORITE CANDLE. got as a gift once and have been in love ever since. the only thing i dislike is that if you burn candles often like me, it seems as if this one burns quickly."
5,21-Mar-19,2,Cheap but not great I have never noticed the smell of this candle. It was a great price though.
5,20-Mar-19,1,"Disappointed in the product. Smell, burn time and value a big disappointment."
5,12-May-19,3,Okay Okay
5,6-May-20,1,Disappointed with purchase The wick won‚Äôt burn. The scent is also very light as if maybe someone altered the candle. I bought it used.
5,13-Jan-20,5,Smells great! Perfect gift! I love candles and this smells amazing
5,19-Feb-20,1,"No scent I really thought I‚Äôd enjoy this candle because of the scent notes however once you light it, there is no smell at all. The sleekness of the jar is nice and all but there is literally no dent from the candle what so ever. I‚Äôm disappointed."
5,1-May-19,1,"The smell burns my nose This candle smells terrible... it's a sort of acrid, soapy smell. Disappointing."
5,11-Aug-19,5,Candles Really like it
5,23-Dec-19,3,Disappointed We were disappointed because these wore purchased for gifted and one arrived broken which resulted in going to the store and purchasing another candle.
5,22-Apr-19,5,Nice clean smell Burns well
5,15-Dec-18,4,Nice! Works well
5,12-Oct-20,3,Broken glass I generally LOVE your products but this item was broken when I opened the package . I am disappointed. I saw that I can't return the item.
5,15-Mar-19,5,Smells pretty Perfect
5,14-Apr-20,5,Candle is soothinf Smells nice. Letting me focus on my study.
5,16-Jun-18,3,"Ok This candle is very soft-scented which I prefer, though burns quickly and is pricey for what you get ."
5,29-Jul-19,5,"Beautiful Scent, The candle smells amazing. Smells like I am at the spa.  Plan to buy a few more."
5,18-Jan-19,5,"Smells good Smells good, gave it to my boss"
5,10-Mar-19,5,"Love it I‚Äôm super picky about what scents I like, most candles and perfumes are too overpowering for me. This candle smells AMAZING. It‚Äôs perfectly light and clean."
5,20-Apr-19,5,I would buy again Nice scent
5,19-Jul-18,2,"Sent the wrong Scent :/ Was sent the wrong scent (Balance & Harmony); didnt notice soon enough. It smells cheap...maybe good for a bathroom during a party. Scent is sharp and artificial. I'm sure there are better scents. The packaging is nice, with the wooden top."
5,26-Oct-20,1,"Never buy I would not recommend this candle to anyone or gift it. There is practically no scent when it is lit. I bought it for its calm description but there is no smell at all, even in small spaces."
5,27-Sep-19,5,"Not bad, but not my favorite Not mad at it, just thought it would be more lofty smelling. But they last a long time!"
5,28-Feb-20,5,Smells so good Wonderful candle.
5,30-Aug-20,5,Nice scent Very calming scent! Will buy them again.
5,24-Jun-19,5,Smells amazinggg This candle smells amazing! Perfect for the coffee table. Will be purchasing again.
5,22-Sep-18,5,A great aromatherapy scent that helps relieve pain I did order these aromatherapy candles to relaxation and meditation to deal with pain and anxiety. I am gifting two of them and two for me.
5,19-Jun-20,5,"Great candle, great value! I LOVE THIS CANDLE! Would highly recommend the Love + Passion scent - it‚Äôs a dupe for the Jonathan Adler soul cycle candle for a fraction of the price. Very pleased!"
5,23-Aug-19,1,Will not buy again I bought the serenity + calm candle and it doesn‚Äôt smell like anything. Does not give off any hint of a lavender or thyme scents. Will not be purchasing again or recommending.
5,29-Sep-20,5,"This Candle has the BEST smell for any place in your Home!! This candle is awesome, smells wonderful.  Not too strong, very refreshing.  I was Happy to find this candle on Amazon I could not find in any stores.  I would actually like to order these candles in bulk one of my favorites. Enjoy!!!"
5,6-Mar-19,5,LONG lasting essence and soft I love candles I love the nice essences and this one is REALLY good and you can smell it but it‚Äôs not strong small very very good one !
5,7-Apr-20,1,"No wick At first the candle lit, having gone round to it the second time the wick (of which there was about 0.5 cm) burnout  and I was left with wax....no use to me now."
5,8-Apr-19,4,Maybe a bad batch It does not smell as strong as others I have purchased from a store.
5,3-Jan-20,5,Arrives on time great packaging I bought 3 to give as gifts
5,1-Mar-20,4,"Trim Wick Great smell, burns fast so make sure to trim wick often!"
5,7-May-20,5,Exactly as shown! Thrilled got get my candle so quickly and exactly as show- no scent problems or product defects! Thrilled to get exactly what I hoped and expected!

5,28-Jun-19,5,Love them.  Fills the house! Great
5,3-Jan-19,5,Amazing Scents I love these candles for our home.
5,30-Mar-17,4,The smokey colored glass jar blends into my decor very easily. I would highly recommend this product I purchased Focus and Patience - one of the new fragrances.  The fragrance is light and very pleasant.  The smokey colored glass jar blends into my decor very easily.  I would highly recommend this product.
5,8-Dec-18,5,"Long Lasting! Not only are the smells amazing for these candles, but they look elegant and the burn time is so long compared to most candles I've bought. I have actually bought several more as Christmas gifts because they are fantastic candles."
5,24-Dec-18,5,Love this candle! I Love the mild but soothing scent
5,21-Mar-20,3,"Candle lasted, scent did now Was a nice candle, lasted pretty long but omg but the scent wasn‚Äôt very strong and didn‚Äôt smell great"
5,21-Dec-19,4,"Good Balance and harmony candle smells amazing, little poorly made candle/product but not bad for price"
5,19-Dec-18,5,love it smell is good and the design is great! I will get it again
5,24-Apr-19,1,Candle does not have a scent Super disappointed with this candle. It smells like nothing. I honestly think I got a bad candle.
5,11-Jul-19,5,Great Love it
5,7-Sep-18,5,"nice product nice quality, nice scent"
5,9-Dec-19,5,Smells amazing Love this candle want to buy other scents. Does not give off a harsh sent and is very pleasant and relaxing.
5,15-Nov-20,3,"Meh This does not smell anything like lavender or thyme. The scent is ok, just not what it say it is."
5,13-Dec-19,5,Very nice scent Good candles. Good price.
5,8-May-19,4,"Last long, not very potent This scent is awesome and burns long, but I am one of those people who likes the scent to fill the room and this candle does not do that for me. The candle is great, but I wish I could smell it as soon I walk into the room and I can't."
5,30-Sep-20,4,"Soild The overall quality is pretty good. The scent didn't seem to travel very far which was a bit disappointing, maybe about a 5 foot radius around. With the price that its listed at I completely recommend giving this product a chance."
5,19-Mar-19,1,"Wasteful Candles I usually burn PartyLite candles, so I know about wick trimming and all.  But no matter how well I took care of this candle at the end there was a lot of left over wax in the bottom which I find wasteful!  I'm glad I used my points to get these as I'd hate to have paid full price and not get full use of the candle, ya know?"
5,3-Dec-18,5,5stars Good quality candle.Balance and Harmony aroma is just right
5,18-Jul-18,4,Maybe wait for cooler months Doesn‚Äôt seem like the best product to buy in the summer. I put it in the oven and it leveled out. I think I lost a good bit of wax though.
5,2-Feb-19,4,Affordable and not overpowering The smell is faint. I do like the overall packaging but I wish the scent was a little stronger. It‚Äôs good for people who don‚Äôt like strong scented candles.
5,29-May-19,5,"Great Scent I really like these candles. For me, the citrus scent is the best. However, my last order two of the candles came smashed to pieces. Just wasn‚Äôt worth the hassle to pick up all the glass, repackage, and send back."
5,7-Feb-20,5,"Love this scent!! Scent is beautiful, not overpowering."
5,16-Dec-18,5,Amazing Amazing candle for a amazing price
5,1-Aug-19,5,The scent The smaller candles didn‚Äôt last as long . The smell was nice
5,27-Apr-20,3,Strong perfume scent Definitely doesn't smell like rose. Do not order if you are looking for a simple rose smell as this smells more like an intense perfume scent.
5,21-Jan-19,5,good good
5,29-Sep-19,2,"Cheap, unusable, good only for decoration The candles are overall fine if you just want them for decoration. The scents arent pleasant, and they dont smell when lit. The wax doesnt burn over the whole candle, and the wick dies almost immediately. One candle came scratched. I'm extremely disappointed."
5,20-Nov-19,5,Amazing scent. One of my favorite scents. I always had it lit. Gives the whole room a lovely aroma.
5,4-Jun-20,1,"Don‚Äôt buy it I don‚Äôt understand why the reviews of this candle are so good. I light this thing up and I can‚Äôt even smell it. The scent is very poor, do yourself a favor and don‚Äôt buy this."
5,24-Nov-20,5,Smells good Good cute looking budget candleSmells good
5,30-Mar-20,4,Calming scent Smells really nice
5,16-Jan-20,5,Nice Smells so good
5,12-Feb-19,5,"diffusers I liked the fact that its about as natural as you can get. Since  I am extremely chemically sensitive I need to be very careful of what I bring into my house, these smell good and don't bother my environment."
5,9-Sep-18,5,I love having Chesapeake Bay candles in my apartment I love having Chesapeake Bay candles in my apartment
5,30-Jul-19,2,"Like the scent, but no refill option I like this and would keep buying it, however they don't sell a refill option. It's incredibly wasteful to keep buying the full set. The scent is a little overpowering at first, but it works well for my cubicle."
5,17-Oct-20,5,lovely soft smell This candle has a lovely soft smell that feels cleaning.  I use it to give my home a pleasant atmosphere
5,20-Dec-18,5,Perfect gift Smells soooo good.
5,28-May-19,2,No smell... Bought 3 different kinds of these candles. They barely smell at all unless I am directly sniffing the candle with it a few inches from my face. This has been consistent across all 3 candles. Very disappointing.
5,28-Apr-19,5,Recommend Great soy candle
5,18-Oct-18,5,Smells wonderful! Love this candle. It smells wonderful!
5,10-Dec-19,5,Pleasing scent small gift type candle It smells really good kind of small for the price.
5,4-Mar-20,1,Cheaply made The candle arrived with the whole wax mold falling out of the container. I can‚Äôt even use it. Great scent but so dissatisfied.
5,12-Sep-20,5,"AMAZING SMELL! But burns kinda fast! One of the best candles I‚Äôve gotten from amazon! The only problem I had with it was that it burned quickly, lasted me about a whole week burning only over night and being put out in the morning."
5,31-Aug-19,3,"Gaps Smells great! However there are gaps in the candle itself. Looks like I‚Äôll have to keep it for myself instead of giving to the intended recipient and see if I can find one locally, without gaps."
5,10-Feb-20,5,Best scent ever! This is probably the best smelling candle I ever bought.  Bought three for Christmas gifts and bought one for myself.
5,2-Nov-20,1,No scent whatsoever This candle has absolutely no scent whatsoever. None. Waste of money don't buy if looking for scented.
5,7-Dec-18,5,Smells amazing Loved it
5,31-Jul-20,1,"The wood top is nice.... and that‚Äôs about it. There‚Äôs very little scent, and the pour inside the glass is scattered with several large gaps of air."
5,1-Mar-20,1,No wick for half of the candle!! Waste! There was no wick for half of this candle.  Was left with half of the candle being unusable.  Candle was great while it lasted but not worth the price.
5,3-Feb-20,5,scent This candle has a great scent- I have been happy with all their products!
5,9-Feb-20,5,Great smell Great smell
5,10-Apr-19,5,"Gift Gifted the item, but it did smell and look good when it came in"
5,1-Feb-20,5,Came back for more !! So good i bought em twice !!!
5,7-Aug-20,3,Good candle but scent isn‚Äôt for me I didn‚Äôt care for the smell. The sweet scent was lovely at first but it has an off putting scent when it burns. Once closed up the after scent is more enjoyable. Good candle but the smell isn‚Äôt for me.

5,9-Sep-20,1,"Poorly packaged. I'm extremely disappointed with the product that came. There was a leak and only half of the product made it into the diffuser holder. It smells great, but I paid for half the product."
5,24-Jul-19,2,"Not worth the $ It's a long lasting candle, and I like the packaging, but my main reason for buying this candle was for the scent.  I barely smell it. . .even when I get up close.  Super disappointed."

5,8-Sep-20,5,"Overall Great Scent for my tiny apartment. I love lighting it while studying, praying, and watching church. My first candel was delivered perfectly and no damage. Hopefully the second one will be delivered that way.?üòç?üòç?üòç"

5,12-Aug-18,1,Do not buy Product arrive melted and messy and after one burn it only burned down the center with a small diameter wasting so much of the wax. After a 3 hour burn it was melted halfway to the bottom. I should be refunded. This is a waste to buy

5,27-Jul-19,5,Great buy Awesome long lasting

5,30-Dec-19,5,Good value I love the smell of this candle. It‚Äôs decently priced and lasts awhile.
5,18-Aug-19,2,"Not much balance here I don‚Äôt understand the positive reviews. While it does cover up any unpleasant odors, it also replaces them with a sooty scent. No amount of trimming the wick eliminates this problem. Would not buy again."
5,23-May-19,2,"Looks nice. Smells bad. Reed diffuser looks beautiful. However, the liquid smells horrible - very strong perfume scent. I was expecting more of an essential oils scent."

The blue one is very nice and spa-ish, and smells like there is a handsome sexy man hiding somewhere in the room. I will probably order it again too. ;) The green is my least favorite. It pretty much just smells like a leaf. Not even a spa-ish leaf, just a leaf, like.... on a tree. In fact, it reminds me of the one time I ate a leaf as a kid. (Don‚Äôt ask. Kids are weird.) I definitely will not be buying it again.That being said, I‚Äôve become unable to throw the jars away because they‚Äôre just too pretty. So I will let it burn down so that I can keep the pretty green glass jar. ;)Enjoy!"
5,24-May-19,5,Peaceful and lovely Very nice smelling. Lasted a good while.
5,30-Apr-20,4,Good Smell. Short Lifespan Smells great. Doesn‚Äôt last too long. Better off going with a $5 candle.
5,20-May-20,5,"Definitely buy this candle I love this candle! It is amazing, it is a clean, fresh and inviting scent!!"
5,14-Jan-20,5,Fabulous Loved everything about this candle
5,10-Dec-19,5,Nice Smells amazing
5,29-Jan-20,2,Where‚Äôs the scent? Not very smelly. I buy candles to make my house smell good and this candle is lacking on scent
5,27-Dec-18,5,"Great quality! Love it, great gift! This is great, it smells amazing and the candle and wooden top are top notch quality."
5,20-Jun-18,5,This really relaxes you if you have a bad day. The scent is mild and not too ... This really relaxes you if you have a bad day. The scent is mild and not too strong. Try this candle.
5,1-Aug-18,4,"Scent of the candle is great, but I did notice that the wick would ... Scent of the candle is great, but I did notice that the wick would burn and pop, leaving black ash residue in the wax. Doesn't look super clean from the top down, but that's not really the main purpose of the candle so I don't mind it."
5,18-Aug-20,5,Scented Candle! Very Fast Shipping! This candle by far exceeds my expectations! The jar is very pretty and the smell is Heavonly! Love it! I will buy more!!!
5,16-Sep-19,5,Calming ‚ù§Ô?è So calming

5,21-Nov-20,3,Not that great of a fragrance There wasn't much of a fragrance and the candle runs out too fast. Would recommend but might be other candles out there with much better longevity and a better smell to it :)
5,11-Jun-17,2,"Had to get rid of it Not good. I purchased Reflection+Clarity, and couldn't detect a single one of the listed scent notes. Instead, I got an overwheming blast of nauseating artificial vanilla.  It was like having a Yankee Candle store in my house.  2 stars for the very attractive container, which I'll reuse with a higher quality scent."
5,30-Jun-19,5,Great scent and color Can‚Äôt go wrong!
5,20-May-20,5,"i love this scent so much Joy+Laughter scent is my fav. I usually buy at target, but they didn't have any in stock so I bought some off amazon. Perfect condition :)"

5,12-Jan-20,5,Great candle Smells great
5,26-Jun-19,2,Disappointed Barely any scent
5,15-Sep-19,4,Scent is nice but not strong The candle smells good. The scent is not strong. Barely enough to fill up a small room. I have the peace and tranquillity one. Used in my dorm. Smell is present and nice but not prominent.
5,11-Sep-20,1,"Lavender order is horrible Maybe it's just me, but it's the worst lavender order I have ever experienced.. It smells very artificial and strong."
5,27-Jul-17,2,"Disappointed Quite disappointed with this product. I bought 2 of them but 1 comes without wick. After careful examination, I found out that the wick was stuck at the bottom of the cup and there's no way to put it back in the middle. Can't use it. The other was fine."
5,2-Sep-19,5,Manly but nice The smell is great for my teen son‚Äôs room!
5,13-Jan-20,1,Don‚Äôt get if you are looking for fragrance when lit Candle does not burn evenly. Burns slowly and does not give off a fragrance. Pretty disappointed. Smelled good before burning. Do not recommend.
5,24-Jan-20,5,True to description Very quality. Pleasant scent

5,26-Feb-20,5,"Best gift of the year Every one I‚Äôve gifted these candles to, love ‚ù§Ô?è love ‚ù§Ô?è love ‚ù§Ô?è them."
5,7-Dec-18,4,"Great restful scent Really helped my sleep, I didn't even have to light it yet I just set it on my nightstand and took the top off and it was pungent enough to help me combat my insomnia and get more rest."
5,17-Jul-20,3,"Don‚Äôt care for the smell It‚Äôs a pretty candle but the smell is too perfume strong, not a relaxing scent.  It gave me a headache."
5,25-Jan-19,5,"Best candle I have had! Forget every other candle you have ever owned. I bought one candle, lit it and moved it from room to room and it filled the room with the wonderful smell within minutes. Best candle ever!"
5,19-Aug-20,1,Barely Scented If you are looking for a candle that you don't have to hold right under your nose to smell the scent then don't pick this one! Very disappointed in this one!
5,24-Apr-20,2,"Scent is minimal! I never write reviews, but I do look carefully at others.  Many reviews voted this as a great smelling candle.  I was very disappointed in the lack of scent."
5,7-Jan-20,4,Clean fresh smell Nice fresh smell..will order again...lasted about 4 days
5,4-Oct-20,1,Completely unscented This candle has absolutely no scent at all.

5,19-Jan-20,5,Aromatherapy Smell is amazing and not to strong.
5,18-Aug-20,1,"AWFUL DO NOT BUY!! The candle does not burn properly. It only burns in the center, creating a small hole and after about 20 minutes the candle went out because the wick is underneath the wax."
5,2-May-18,5,Great candle Love the scent - it's a beautiful candle.
5,5-Apr-18,4,Four Stars good smell
5,12-Mar-19,5,Long burner Great
5,18-Nov-18,1,The candle‚Äôs  scent is virtually undetectable. The aroma of the candle is undetectable beyond 5 feet away.
5,18-Jul-20,1,Nice but burns wuickly Great but does not last long at all!! Too expensive for longevity
5,13-Dec-18,1,Smells good but of bad quality/make Candle came without a wick and all melty/damaged. I don't even dare light the candle if there is a wick attached. This candle is made in China!!! Not made in USA as mentioned above.
5,20-Nov-20,1,Terrible Terrible
5,20-Jan-19,5,Love these candles! Smells great and burns evenly!
5,11-Jun-18,4,Four Stars Smell is a bit faint but is pleasing

5,10-Aug-20,5,"Great smell, relaxing Smells very good, my gf loves it when she first saw the candle. The scent is very relaxing. Great for relaxation after a long day! Will recommend this to anyone."

5,20-Feb-20,5,Great smell I love the smell and the glasd holder it comes in. I just wish it had more burn time.
5,11-Jun-19,1,Dangerous Be careful. This candle exploded while burning and destroyed my table. I contacted the seller and asked for at least a refund but never heard back. The candle is dangerous and should not be sold.
5,22-Mar-20,5,Great Smells great.
5,3-Aug-18,3,Cabdle5 Not as fragrant as I had hoped for
5,31-Jul-19,2,Not all scents are created equal. The scent of lemongrass/eucalyptus was a bad scent. Smelled like cheap hair product.  I he Eucalyptus/Fir scent was nice.  Be careful with your choice.
5,23-Apr-20,5,"La fragancia est?° deliciosa La fragancia est?° deliciosa!!! Simplemente lo mejor q he comprado en velas arom?°ticas1,000 %recomendado ME ENCANTO!!!"
5,2-Apr-17,4,Great candle. I left it burning all day and ... Great candle. I left it burning all day and it barely put a dent in what's left. The scent smells nice and clean but is not over whelming.

5,2-May-19,1,Do not like. I do not either of the scents I purchased. Too strong.

5,10-Jul-19,5,Just right I love when you come in the room and the scent is just right and smells natural.  This product is for you if you agree.
5,28-Oct-20,1,Very unhappy The candle looks old like it belonged to someone else. The top and the jar is worn. I purchase this item as a gift for someone. I will be returning this item for a full refund.

5,14-May-19,5,Smells good It's a candle and I liked it. Not sure what else to say about it.
5,11-Sep-19,1,Unacceptable item. and Dangerous. Broken Glass. And Black Smoke. Did not like it one bit. Overpriced. Dark visible smoke. Short lasting. And one of the candles had broken when lit.

5,17-Nov-19,2,Can't feel the scent at all. This Cashmere Jasmine scent is very gentle/light. You won't fill it much. I will get a different fragrance from them next time.
5,7-Dec-18,1,Frustrated. It came all scraped up Came damaged and don‚Äôt have time to wait for replacement

5,12-May-19,5,Perfect Smells so good!
5,8-Jan-19,4,"Long Lasting This candle is really long lasting and looks really elegant sitting on the table. However, the scent wasn't as strong as I would have liked. I couldn't really smell it unless I was sitting really close to the candle. The wick would also bunch up with continued use."

5,6-Feb-20,5,"Great scent and I love the looks! I bought Love +Passion, I love it! Great scent and looks. Definitely buy more for other guest bathrooms ‚ù§Ô?èIts too sweet for mine so I‚Äôll try Other scent....hopefully it‚Äôs good too."

5,14-Nov-17,5,"Beautiful candle! Love the look of these candles! The colored, frosted jar looks nice, and the wood cover makes it look fancy, rather than like a cheap candle :) Scent is nice, and it‚Äôs great that there‚Äôs 3 wicks to burn evenly. Product shipped and arrived quickly!"

5,26-Aug-18,4,"Shifted wax due to packaging I reoorder these every month. However, this time the candle was tilted in the packaging. Which led the wax to shift on one side and cover the wick. I had to drain the wax by heating it over the stove and then light this candle."
5,27-Mar-17,4,"... past year or so and I am always very pleased with the overall appearance I have purchased several Chesapeake Bay candles over the past year or so and I am always very pleased with the overall appearance. This candle is not any different!  The frosted glass and wood cover really give it an expensive look. Unfortunately, I am disappointed in the amount of fragrance the candle gives off.  The ""peace and tranquility"" scent is quite pleasant, but unless I am sitting right next to the candle it is really difficult to smell it."
5,28-May-19,5,Gifted to mom and mother-in-law. Great scent and they loved it. Great scent - nice gift - looks attractive as well.

5,6-Jan-19,5,Nice Product Scented but not to strong. Very relaxing.
5,18-Dec-18,2,"Didn't receive what was ordered These were purchased as office gifts along with 5 of the balance and harmony. What I received was all balance and harmony.

5,23-Mar-19,1,Not worth it Very disappointed.  The scent is barely noticeable
5,15-Aug-17,1,"It smells amazing when you pop the top off I purchased a Chesapeake Bay candle in the Peace and Tranquility scent at a local store.  The smell was very relaxing.  When my candle was all finished, the local store no longer carried it so I searched online.  Found it here on Amazon and bought it.  Did the formula change?  Did I get an old candle?  It smells amazing when you pop the top off, but after you light it...it doesn't fill the room (a medium size bedroom) with the amazing fragrance like the previous candle did.  Disappointed."
5,10-Jan-19,5,Will buy again Smells great
5,5-Nov-20,5,Nice scent Like the scent but wish the lid closed around the bottle.
5,30-May-18,5,Tremendous value I am so glad that I purchased both of these candles. The name attracted me. Living on Delmarva. I love anything Chesapeake. Gone are the days of looking for yankee candles. Instantly the room smelled tremendous.

5,11-May-20,3,It came broken It‚Äôs one of my favorite scents. I was just upset that one of them came broken
5,27-Apr-18,1,"Highly disappointed after doing much research Highly disappointed after doing much research.  This is not all ""Soy.""  It has a good amount of paraffin in it, to include in the wick.  After lighting and letting it burn several times, when blown out, lots of black smoke, the wick turned black as well as the jar.  Soy by itself as a candle is toxic.  Paraffin is added to reduce the toxins.  If it's not good for humans to breath this stuff, then I'm sure it's just as bad for my 3 cats.  I will never buy this expensive candle again.  Beeswax is healthier and better for you.  I'm going to make my own."

5,18-Apr-18,2,"Wick frays and makes a small flame Jar is nice.  Scent is too.  But the wick is terrible quality.  It frays and creates a blob of cotton at the tip that dampens the flame.  The next time you go to light it, you have to trim off the blob of wick.  Now half way burned, there are dozens of black blobs in the wax from when the wick casted off it frayed tip.  Hard to describe, but these are cheaply made candles.  I won't be buying again.  Too bad, I'd hoped I'd found a dependable candle to keep buying over the years."

5,12-Jul-18,1,One Star This candle will not stay lit the wick is too short and poorly made.

5,8-Nov-18,2,Could barley smell the scent I was disappointed in the lack of scent coming from the candle.
5,4-Feb-19,1,poorly made The wick was too small and wouldn't light
5,24-Mar-18,5,Five Stars Smells great
5,3-Jul-18,3,"Sweet smell that is VERY mild These candles are just 'okay.' The teakwood incense smells great, but you have to have your nostrils right up by the flame to be able to smell it. Buyers, be cautious: the fragrance is really, really mild. I have the candle on a table right next to my desk and I can't smell it at all. It's definitely disappointing, since I've had candles that cost way less that were considerably more fragrant."
5,12-May-18,2,Two Stars This candle has no scent.
5,9-Oct-18,1,Candles arrived melted The candles arrived in a complete mess in the box. Half of the wax was melted and the candles were not usable

5,18-May-18,5,Five Stars Smells amazing!
5,4-Jul-19,5,Love! Love
5,17-Jun-17,1,"Great if you're within a foot of it Mind & Body: Maybe they've watered down the oil, or maybe I just got a bad one, but I honestly cannot smell this from more than a foot away. All the oil is in, I tried turning the sticks - nothing. It's been 4 days. It looks nice though, I guess."
5,12-Jan-18,3,"Smells like a boys locker room after an axe body spray ... Got the ""Confidence + Freedom"" scent (aka oak moss amber). Smells like a boys locker room after an axe body spray fight. Candle looks nice though."
5,27-Jun-18,5,Five Stars Love this scent!
5,2-Jan-18,5,Five Stars Love it!!!
5,8-Mar-18,5,Five Stars Smells amazing and fills up the room

5,11-Jun-19,1,Broken when arrived Came shattered.
5,4-Jan-18,5,Five Stars Smells so good and is bigger than expected!
5,23-Feb-19,2,"Missing wick? Smells good, would be nice to burn it."
5,14-Sep-18,2,"One of the few and rare items that good review was NOT HELPFUL. I was impressed by the great reviews. usually this is the most important factor when I look for a value and quality item.  I purchased a few of the Chesapeake Bay Candles.  There is none or faint smell. its just a nice glowing candle.  its useless, unless you have no electricity in your home and need a candle.  what a rare disappointment  for me.  save your money and buy something else."
5,29-Oct-18,1,Broken !!!!! It came broken!!!!!
5,17-May-18,2,"Intense, unpleasant laundry detergent smell I buy scented candles quite often and I was curious about these since they are quite reasonably priced. I suppose you get what you pay for - these are nicely packaged and look high quality but both emit such a strong laundry detergent smell, its really unpleasant. I bought 'balance + harmony' (green) which is a little sweeter but still has a strong detergent smell and 'confidence + freedom' which honestly smells like a cross between cheap men's deodorant and laundry detergent. Both very pungent. I might try one of the fruitier scents to see if its any better but these are both unusable."
5,14-Feb-19,5,Good! Good!
5,9-Aug-18,1,broken! i would not buy this again.
5,11-Feb-18,4,"Great burn time, and really nice scent. Bought this to have a nice smelling candle in the house. It isn't overpowering, which is nice, and has a great burn time. It lasted quite a while. I'll probably buy another one of these when this one burns down. I have some really strong scented candles that I don't burn often because they can get overpowering. This I can burn for hours and it doesn't bother me, but is strong enough to be pleasant."
5,5-Sep-17,2,Arrived Broken I would give it 5 stars but it arrived broken.  I like the idea of a cover to keep the dust out and I like the smell.  It is a pretty candle if it wasn't broken.
5,17-Aug-18,3,"Lovely scent just not strong enough While I liked the scent Peace and Tranquility, the throw is terrible.i can hardly smell it when it's been burning and I'm sitting right near it"
5,16-Sep-17,3,"I don't think the scent is great. It's not enough to fill a small room I don't think the scent is great. It's not enough to fill a small room, in my experience. It's pretty but if you want it for anything other than a pretty candle, I didn't find it useful."
5,30-Jun-18,1,"Burns wayyyyyy too fast I buy lots of candles with these listed ingredients and they usually stick around a while. I burned this for three days, maybe three hours at a time (movie length usually) and it‚Äôs basically gone. What the heck."
5,18-Oct-18,3,"Not bad but not great Smell is great , just too weak , unless you are close to it you won‚Äôt smell it. I suspect it could be the reeds , haven‚Äôt tried different ones. I bought 3 of them to put in diff rooms and it‚Äôs still not enough and at 20 a pop that‚Äôs just too expensive to replace 3 at a time."
5,30-Aug-16,5,"Great smell that lasts! This diffuser lasts longer than the ones of the past. I had given up on these, due to their quickly fading smell. However, this one is still making my bathroom smell fantastic nearly a month after being opened! I ordered another for my Mom's birthday.Shipping was quick and packaging was great!"
5,12-Dec-17,5,"I've used it many times and left it lit for hours and as you can see from the pics it dried up evenly and still looks great. The soft smell is soothing The candle burned evenly and clean. I have a big office, the smell is light and not overwhelming. The smell sticks around for a long time after blowing out the candle. I've used it many times and left  it lit for hours and as you can see from the pics it dried up evenly and still looks great. The soft smell is soothing. All the customers that came in enjoyed it very much."
5,12-Mar-18,2,"Good smell but small radius It has a great smell, however, only if you're within a range of 3 feet from the candle.  I have a one bedroom apartment and thought it would at least have the main room smell.  Perhaps it's a dud.  I'll use it on the coffee table to keep it within range of the couch."
5,29-Jan-18,5,"Can't Go Wrong with this Candle! I've been using this brand of candle now for a few years. They are a fantastic item to have in your home.  The glass/jar it comes in is classy, pretty and just doesn't look cheep.  The colors you can choose from are great also.  Of course the smells Chesapeake Bay Candles offer are fenominal and don't dissapoint."
5,2-Jan-18,2,"Where's the Patchouli or any other thing from nature? You know that smell when you walk into the Sephora and open every tester of perfume and spill them on yourself and then get into a time machine to the early aughts to walk by Abercrombie, Hollister, and Pac Sun at the old Mall anchored by Macy's next to the Sports Authority? Well that's pretty much what this candle smells like. #blessed."
5,15-Oct-18,1,"Poor quality wick This is a pretty candle. Like other reviewers, I agree that it's fragrance doesn't reach beyond it's immediate area. It looks high quality to me until I noticed there is a wire in the wick. Big disappointment and a nonstarter for me. I recommend looking for Paddywax Apothecary candles instead. Sea Salt and Sage is wonderful."
5,4-Mar-18,2,Beautiful candle vase but disappointing no fragrance. Bought it because of the high ratings... pretty disappointed.. inside the candle the scent is beautiful however once lit there's nothing to smell. I let it on for two whole days and nothing . Glade candles acutely put out better scents in the room than this.
5,7-Apr-17,5,"Awesome scent, durable glass jar! A win win! Refreshing scent, beautiful glass jar with awesome wood cover! I accidentally dropped it upon pulling it from the Amazon box and to my amazement, IT DIDNT BREAK! Overall, I love these candles!!"
5,8-Apr-18,1,Not a wooden wick candle I bought this thinking it was a wooden wick candle when I opened it I was very disappointed to see it had a regular wick. Amazon should not have this candle listed with the wooden wick candles. I feel I paid way too much money for a regular candle.
5,31-Oct-17,3,Wickless.. Candle smells wonderful but for about $15 i expected a dang wick to be inside of it ready to burn.. in short bad seller good smelling product.
5,6-Sep-18,2,"Pretty and good scent, but not strong enough! Looks pretty but scent is almost nonexistent. I tried flipping the reeds and that helped for a couple minutes but not much longer. If you want the scent to fill a room bigger than a small bathroom, this is not your diffuser."
5,15-Oct-18,2,Nope Nice size for the price. This scent smells way too much like those automatic air fresheners in grungy gas stations you stop to pee in when you're having to drive through Alabama on your way home from a beach trip.
5,3-Nov-17,2,Smells great / not gift worthy Ordered for a gift but had to return. Candle looks second hand as half the label was missing :( smells good otherwise if you don‚Äôt mind the awkward printing fail.
5,14-Sep-18,3,"QUALIFY IS JOB ONE 3 candles came paper wrapped around bubble wrap in individual sealed Protectively marked boxes as would be expected dealing with fragile glass & wax contents; however shockingly the 4th candle half bubble WRAPPED loosely dropped in among other things bounced around, melted all OVER ITSELF AND THE OTHER CONTENTS.. MAKING IT HALF OF LESS ITS SIZE, NOT ITS WORTH, CREATED A MESS ON EVERYTHING ELSE... COMPLETELY DISAPPOINTED ME IN THE PROFESSIONALISM OF YOUR COMPANY.. I WOULD LIKE A PROPER REPLACEMENT CANDLE GIVING YOU A 2ND CHANCE."
5,29-Mar-18,2,"Nice scent, weak strength I love these candles, but this one came only lightly scented and that was kind of disappointing. It is a wonderful light smell, but the candle wasn't strong enough to fill my apartment."
5,3-Aug-18,1,No Mas Beware of purchase in heat especially heatwaves the wax was melted I was really looking forward to the purchase so extra disappointing this review says it all
5,17-Sep-18,2,"Reeds don't work The oil holder looks very nice and feels heavy so I hope it will last. And the oil itself smells great. Unfortunately the reeds do not soak up any of the oil! I have had them in the oil over a week and can't smell anything even with my nose right up to the reeds, and I've flipped them a few times. Very disappointed as I'm now going to have to pay AGAIN to get reeds that work."
5,5-Aug-18,1,Can't smell it unless you're 6 inches away Looks fine smells good have to be super close to smell it disappointed thought it would fill the room and it doesn't would not buy this again
5,30-Oct-17,5,"Beautiful candle This is my 3rd Chesapeake candle, first time with this scent. These candles are the prettiest around-frosted glass with a wood top. The other two candles have a very powerful smell-one that keeps going hours after you blow it out. This scent is very mild, which is what I would expect from a scent called ‚Äúpeace and tranquility‚Äù.  Would definitely purchase this candle again!"
5,11-Jan-18,1,One Star The confidence & freedom scent smells like mens cologne
5,1-Dec-17,1,"Broke during shipping. Good smell. Nice appearance, wish it didn't break."
5,3-Jul-17,1,Plastic. Not real. This is plastic
5,3-May-18,5,"Great smell This and two other things in the box werent ripped, broken or leaking"
5,25-Aug-18,2,Disappointed Love the scent but wick mushrooms
5,30-Nov-17,3,"Expensive and Short Lived This candle is much smaller than expected. For the price, expected something larger and that would last longer.  Fragrance and design are nice."
5,20-Jun-17,2,Two Stars Smells like cheap shampoo
5,30-Aug-17,5,Smells nice Smells so good I had to buy another one for my son.
5,16-Apr-18,5,Five Stars Finally a candle that actually fills the room with a very pleasant scent. Will definitely order again!
5,13-May-18,1,One Star There was absolutely no scent. But the wick worlds. So. I guess that‚Äôs a plus.
5,25-Dec-17,1,One Star Nasty scent. Returned item
5,20-Feb-18,1,"Not worth it Low quality wick, essentially unscented, nice jar, not made in Maryland."
5,21-May-17,1,Not that impressed Focus and Patience smells exactly the same as Axe deodorant :-/
5,14-Jul-18,1,"2nd & Last time purchasing.. I ordered this product for a friend, and ordered it with same day shipping. Opened it up and saw that the candle had already been burned & a bit of wax had dripped onto the side. I understand that there's a certain amount of rush that comes along with same day shipping but to send a customer a product that has already been used is ridiculous. Disappointed because these are great candles."
5,22-Nov-17,1,I would like to have a replacement I received this candle today and it was defected. There is no wick and it looked used. I would like to have a replacement.
5,13-Dec-17,1,One Star Came smashed to pieces
5,7-Mar-19,5,"Best candle I‚Äôve ever bought.. seriously LET ME JUST TELL YALL ABOUT THIS CANDLE?üëè?üèª?üëè?üèª?üëè?üèª I ordered the ‚ÄúJoy + Laughter‚Äù scent and was like okay wth does joy & laughter smell like but ordered it and when it arrived, I could literally smell it through the BOX. like... this candle smells SO GOOD. I‚Äôm so tired of buying Bath&Bodywork candles, Yankee Candles, using messy wax melts, when all they do is make a certain small area smell decent. THIS CANDLE HAS GOT MY WHOLE HOUSE SMELLING LIKE JOY + LAUGHTER. never buying another candle that‚Äôs not this brand, this was such a mind blowing purchase?üòÇ and it lasts FOREVER!?üôå?üôå 10/10 would recommend?üëå?üèª"
5,14-Apr-20,5,"Compassionate Candle If you want to show compassion to another human being, give them this candle or alert them of its presence. It is in my self-case arsenal and I highly suggest it be in yours too. There are a wide variety of scents to choose from so go forth and create your own little oasis. I have sensitive skin and sensory disturbance issues. I find these candles do not trigger me or my significant other who has migraines occasionally. The thing to keep in mind is to burn little, slow and not often with a fan going and proper air circulation throughout your unit. You are creating smoke. It is good to keep these things in mind for the sake of the environment and your own body.I was not compensated in any way for this review. I like to give open, honest and transparent feedback on products I like to try. I hope you found this review to be helpful. If so, please click the 'Helpful' button to let myself and others know that it has helped you."
5,7-Jun-20,2,"Not my Favorite I've tried other candles in this line before, but the ""love + passion"" scent is a little too strong and a little too chemical-ly for my taste. It smells like fermented grapefruit and mango perfume.  The candle lid also says there is no added formaldehyde, which leads me to believe there may already be some in the wax. Definitely will not be a repeat purchase."
5,3-Nov-17,5,"Teakwood is the best! My favorite scent is the Courage + Wisdom (Teakwood scent). These are my favorite for many reasons. Long lasting, strong and this is a GREAT hippie woodsy fall, clove scented candle. I love they‚Äôre made with real essential oils and soy. I originally discovered this at Target. Then, Target quit selling it. Target sells half of the original scents still though just not this one. I‚Äôll be buying them on here I guess now. ?üôÇ I smelled every Chesapeake Bay candle Target carried and this was my favorite. This particular line of theirs is FAR superior to their normal scented candles. Love the package design. Minimal label and wood lid; I‚Äôm a design major I notice these things and they bother me. ?üòÖ"
5,31-Jul-20,5,Unexpected Gift from the HEART ‚ù§Ô?è I received the Awaken + Invigorate scent as a unexpected gift from my Beautiful Niece yesterday. The scent reminds me  of a eucalyptus candle  I purchased serveral times before because I Truly Love the scent. I have this candle on a Table as you enter and exit to my outdoor patio . The scent is so relaxing and inviting along with the warm summer breeze in California today OMG!!The candle was securely packed in a beautiful royal blue with gold in a large gift pouch..Unexpected Gifts come from the HEART ‚ù§Ô?èThank you JaM and Amazon!
5,8-Apr-19,1,"Smells like nothing, scent profiles make no sense I love the scent of jasmine, so I thought I'd try this as jasmine appears to be a dominant note even though cashmere as a scent makes no sense (I have no idea what it even is? I think it's made up of many other scents?).  Anyway, this candle smells like nothing even if cashmere isn't a fictional scent. I was burning it (medium size) in a 500 sq foot room and thought maybe the room is too big, so I moved it to my tiny  bathroom but it still smells like nothing. I've let it burn for an hour, enter the room and couldn't tell you anything was burning. Waste of money."
5,28-May-20,1,"Do not recommend Tried giving this product a shot, but does not deserve a positive recommendation. The candle barley has any scent. I am not an individual of a strong scent finder but a decent sensible scent that you can pick up easily - this candle was not the case of a medium scent. It has a very low scent that you need to stick around for a while to try and find. Glad I bought the small jar to try out first. Best of luck purchasing this candle!"
5,29-Aug-19,4,Exceptional value!! Great throw! Any experienced candle user knows a candle is only as good as how well it ‚Äú throws‚Äù scent or makes the environment smell. These Chesapeake candles are awesome and a great value. These candles are affordable here or even better when on clearance at TARGET. Hard to believe they compete with the fancy schmancy candles we get that cost up to 5 times as much!!  Head my advice and don‚Äôt vacillate.. get them. You‚Äôll love them and  so will anyone who comes to your home.
5,3-May-17,5,"Great smelling candle This is the first candle I have tried by Chesapeake Bay Candle. Other brands I have tried are Village Candle, Bath and Body Works, and Yankee Candle.  I've used the Chesapeake Bay candle for short and long amounts of time to test the scent and wick.  This Chesapeake Bay candle smells really good and burns very well. What I mean by that is some wicks blow out on their own after a certain amount of time burning.  The wick of this candle stays burning for hours without using as much of the wax as one would expect.  The smell is consistent and just the right amount, not too overpowering, and not seemingly nonexistent. I tried the Love and Passion.  So what does love and passion smell like?  It's a nice floral scent without being too flowery. Their size large is like Yankee Candle medium in a cylindrical jar.  Its a good deal at $20. I will definitely buy more."
5,13-Dec-19,5,"DO NOT LET YOUR CANDLES BURN LOW I bought these candles from Yankee and I absolutely love them! My favorite is the tobacco and cedar but Yankee considered it an under performer and stopped selling it and thankfully it's sold on amazon! These candles have a great smell!I keep seeing reviews saying their candle exploded. Please read the warnings on your candles, ALL candle manufacturers advise from burning your candle once it gets so close to the bottom because it will shatter the glass. So please be watchful of how low your candles are when you are burning them."
5,9-Dec-18,3,"Make sure you receive the right one. Although these candles smell lovely, the reliability of which one you get is not so awesome. I sent one to my elderly mother  and specifically chose the cashmere jasmine as this is her favorite smell and reminds her of better times (she is sick and struggling). Come to find out after she received it that they sent her the wrong candle. My mother is elderly, not all there anymore, and lives in a rural part of the country that makes returning it for the proper candle a difficult task that she doesn‚Äôt feel comfortable undertaking. Although she is grateful for the gift, it is disappointing that the entire point of it was lost. Especially when the first gift I sent her never arrived because it was lost in transit. These little things mean a lot to an old woman."
5,11-Jun-19,5,Great Candle An amazing smelling candle that burns extraordinarily long. The smell is more welcoming than the heavy perfumes in other name brand candles. Highly recommend and will definitely be buying again when this one burns out.
5,18-Nov-18,5,"My Fav Candle Ever The ""Balance + Harmony"" and ""Stillness + Purity"" candles by Chesapeake Bay smell AMAZING! They are my all time favorite candles. They are so clean, fresh, and calming. The smell is so light, and pure. B+H smells like lily, while S+P smells like roses, they really live up to the feelings that they are named after."
5,22-Feb-20,4,"Smells wonderful! I can't speak to the other scents, but I received the ""Balance & Harmony"" scented candle in my Christmas stocking and I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. It is not smoky as many soy based candles are and the the scent fills up the entire house. I will definitely buy another after this runs out."
5,22-Feb-19,5,"I love this candle it smells A1 I saw this candle at barnes and noble but got lazy to go back and buy it and I found it on amazon and bought the little jar! I then I burnt it all out and then bought taller one! it smells like soft berry but has a warm scent to it as well, it is not super over powering so it is good I recommend!"
5,24-Mar-19,3,"Maybe I should get a stronger scent? My expectations were off. I was hoping this candle would make a room smell just by keeping it open. The scent is nearly invisible. In order to smell the candle you have to be a couple feet close by and even then you have to make an effort. Maybe I need a stronger scent than medium? However, the scent that can be smelled is nice."
5,12-Jan-19,5,Wonderful!! Totally worth it. I absolutely love this candle and will continue to reorder. It lasts a long time!! Most candles I buy at target or Wal-Mart don't last as long as this one did and it's got a strong but peaceful smell.
5,10-Feb-20,5,"A peaceful and wonderful scent This was my first purchase of Cheasapeske Bay Candle, and it smell so good! I ordered two more. The scent is so calming. It is not overpowering, and filled the room with such a peaceful tranquility feeling."
5,19-Apr-17,5,"Love + Passion smells amazing, lasts forever This candle looks very luxe and smells amazing.  Love + Passion reminds me of an oil I used to purchase from The Body Shop 15 years ago but I don't remember what it was called.  The scent is quite strong and can be smelled throughout my entire first level while burning.  Even my husband who normally only likes the firewood/leather/man type scents really enjoys this candle.  Lovely, fresh spring/summer scent!"
5,10-Feb-19,2,"Not for Beginners!! I actually loved the candle itself but I guess it‚Äôs just not for ‚Äúbeginners‚Äù. I was unaware that there were specific guidelines to burning candles. I did not trim the wick, but I also didn‚Äôt let it burn for 4+ hours. Just kind of scary that this could happen! Just actually know what you‚Äôre dealing with and tell people if you gift them a candle - always trim the wick!! Apparently that is a universal rule in the candle world."
5,7-May-20,5,"Great Candle I bought this for my mother-in-law for Christmas, and she liked it a lot. It was a lot bigger than I thought it would be, so that's also a plus."
5,1-Mar-18,5,"I received this candle for Mother's Day from my sweet Niece. Once I lit it I received this candle for Mother's Day from my sweet Niece.  Once I lit it, I fell in love with it!  Some candles burn for hours and you smell nothing. This candle is somewhat citrus and smooth!  I'm so happy I found it on Amazon, I will order several!  Love it!"
5,17-Oct-20,5,LOVE IT! relaxes mind and a great stress reliever In love with this candle! it relaxes my mind and keeps my home peaceful! it‚Äôs very refreshing and love the scent!
5,28-Nov-18,5,"Different smells, different friends. So. My candle wouldnt burn for more than an hour. Whats the deal with that? So i was burning your candle and i had friends over, and they thought it smelled weird? Why, i asked myself? Based on my reviews i thought i could swoon my guest and have a lovely evening. But no. I now need new friends and candles to replace those i lost. I hope that im not the only one who has lost friends due to your candles! To all those seeking help and friendhip! I thought these candles would help but i was wrong! Alas if youre looking for friends these candles are not for you!"
5,25-Apr-17,4,"Worthwhile Single Wick Candle After arriving home from vacation my home had an unpleasant odor. I lit this candle to mask rhe smell. It worked great for the bedroom. The aroma was smooth without being cloying.  I have high ceilings in my living area and the candle aroma did not permate the area at all. It is a long lasting candle, for the few hours it burned it hardly made a dent in the wax."
5,24-Aug-20,5,"Very happy with this candle. This was a gift for my sister. She absolutely loved it, especially the smell.She thought it was absolutely lovely."
5,19-Aug-20,2,"Disappointed I wasted my money -- can't smell it at all. I've burned it for several hours over the last few days to give it a chance, but I can't smell anything at all from this candle. Very disappointed because I was excited about the scent and expected more for the price/company reputation. Not sure if this is limited to just the serenity + calm, but doesn't make me want to give other scents a chance."
5,5-Dec-17,5,Lovely scent This has such a pleasant scent with notes of citrus. I like the look of the jar and the wooden lid really does add a nice touch. You can tell right away that this is a quality candle and it will sit well in the bedroom. The candle itself is a soy/wax blend and burns well with a trimmed wick.
5,22-Jan-20,5,"Solid choice! I love the scent, very clean! The blue jar and wooden top add serenity to the flame! I‚Äôm a one wick fan so this is just right for me!"
5,29-Oct-18,5,Great gift I've ordered several of these - different scents for different people and all packages have gotten to the recipients unharmed!
5,15-Jul-19,4,"Good smell, off-center wick Love + Passion smells great and fits the description of grapefruit mango. The medium is a little smaller than I was expecting but I know for the future to go larger. Only complaint is my particular candle's wick was not placed in the center so it did not burn straight down and tunneled along the side."
5,7-Jul-19,5,"Makes a lovely gift! I bought this as a gift for a secret Santa and they absolutely LOVED it. They loved the smell, it lasts forever. Great for aromatherapy, really helps to unwind."
5,27-Apr-20,5,Clean & Freshing Scent Purchased this for a friend who is undergoing chemo to help with relaxing. She has informed me that the scent is very refreshing and relaxing and that she would purchase it again in the near future.
5,30-Mar-17,5,"Chesapeake Bay Candle Mind & Body... This is a very classy looking candle with its columnar shape and wooden lid.  It is 6.2 inches tall by 3.20 dia.The ‚Äúlove& passion ‚Äúscent is a very warm, peachy scent. The flame burns clean and last a long time.I usually buy Yankee candles but I think this is going to be my new favorite."
5,4-Jun-19,4,They‚Äôre a nice gift The candles are lovely. They do not have much scent once lit. I ordered them as gifts with a message included in each of 4 but no messages were enclosed. Now I must goBuy cards.
5,11-Aug-20,5,Best candle EVER! Best candle for scent and price. Very difficult to find!
5,8-Dec-19,5,Great gift! This was a gift for my nephew. And he loved it!
5,8-Apr-20,5,Great for a gift! I bought it for a friend and she loved it!
5,1-Aug-19,5,"Best scented candles, slow steady burn with equal diffusion. Better than any other brand! The scent is mild yet infuses the entire immediate area with a long lasting and pleasant burn. Highly recommended"
5,24-Feb-18,5,My new favorite smell! Seriously the best smelling candle I've ever had. Slow burn so it lasts a long time too. I leave mine on the kitchen table and it makes the entire kitchen and living room smell glorious.
5,22-Jan-20,1,"NO FRAGRANCE! I ordered the 12.5 oz. Of Peace + tranquility candle. I was very excited to see the beautiful frosted glass it cam in. However there is absolutely NO fragrance smell at all. For the price I paid, would of thought there would be a very nice fragrance. NONE AT ALL.Not happy with the fragrance at all! ?üôÑ"
5,12-May-19,5,Great gift Got compliments from the receiver. Loved the smell. Good sized for price. Well packaged and well made container.
5,20-Jun-17,5,Smells Great! This looks great in the jar (the wooden lid is a nice touch) but smells even better. We ran this overnight the first night to get the wick and the wax broken in and loved the smell. I love that the smell comes from essential oils. I've heard about chemicals damaging and making people sick.
5,20-Aug-20,5,Sent it to my friend she liked it Sent it to my friend she liked it
5,29-Aug-19,5,"Awesome Candles! Gave a couple of these to my cousin for her birthday & she loved them! There was an issue where they arrived broken but Amazon sent out a replacement super quickly. Overall, happy with the customer service and the product!"
5,30-Mar-20,3,Scents your home for a few days This candle scented up my entire living room the first two days it was burned. After that the smell didn‚Äôt project well in the room at all.
5,30-May-19,5,Medium candle much bigger opening smelled great big one scent seems to get stuck small opening I got the middle size 3 wicks for mother‚Äôs day I love the scent. So I ordered the large one barely any smell candle is like a big glass think the middle size has big opening doesn‚Äôt get trapped. Definitely ordering the 2 pack of the middle size loved that one
5,22-Nov-20,5,Definitely Suggest! Love this candle. The scent is fresh and clean. Comes packaged very well for gifting. Love it!
5,28-Jul-20,2,Merchandise was broken Bought the double candle bundle for a friend & they received it cracked. It's unfortunate there's no way to receive a replacement w/o sending it back. Do you really want a cracked candle back? They said it smelled good.
5,21-Mar-19,5,Nice candle Got one for my mom. She loved it!
5,26-Apr-17,5,A Favorite! I originally purchased this product from Target and was disappointed when they discontinued it. The fragrance is lovely... thanks!!!
5,17-Feb-19,5,p u This smells of Loves Baby Soft from the 70s. So sickly sweet. Yikes.
5,17-Jul-20,1,No scent when lit Received as a gift. The actual candle smells amazing so I was excited. I lit the candle and no scent came From it. Very disappointing. I was expecting a lot from this candle and it was basically like a $1 unscented candle when it is lit.
5,8-Dec-19,5,Great Great
5,30-May-19,4,Nice smell - more of a bathroom smell to me Smells good in the bathroom - not so much for me in the bedroom or living room/den
5,4-Dec-19,5,Pleasant perfect Awesome! It burns just like any other glass candle but it's aromoma is so nice it goes too fast. Get it? Buy it.
5,11-Apr-17,4,"Smells great Love & Passion:Very attractive container.  Smells fantastic, both idle and burning, not overpowering, just a sweet subtle fruit.  Price is a bit hard to choke down, but very nice candle and the jar will certainly be reused."
5,29-Jan-18,4,"Four Stars I ordered ""Reflection and Clarity"" and has a nice fresh smell."
5,23-Oct-19,5,Very giftable! Used this for a GET WELL gift and she loved it.
5,6-May-20,5,Love it I got one of these for Christmas and omg. It‚Äôs the best candle ever. I had it lit in my living room and it made my whole 6 rooms apt smell good.

5,5-Aug-19,5,Nice gift idea Bought as a gift... beautiful candle
5,12-Sep-19,5,Smells great Wife loves it
5,17-Jul-20,1,Item was sent back in April Now I got charged again for it. This item was sent back months ago and now I am being told I am being charged for it it was defective because the wick was not in the candle.  It was unusable and now I am being charged for a candle I dont have and can't use.
5,1-Oct-20,5,"great candle, great gift! nice item!"
5,19-Jul-20,5,Best candle ever This is the best smelling candle I have ever had. I love it. ‚ù§Ô?è
5,13-Apr-19,1,Do Not Buy fire danger! Glass breaks under heat Candle glass broke from the heat of the candle. Very very very dangerous!!!
5,10-Nov-20,1,NOT PURE SOY THIS CANDLE IS NOT PURE SOY  i.e.  IT BURNS DIRTY  LIKE YANKEE CANDLE PRODUCTSWHICH IS 20 FROM MY HOME  NEW ENGLAND
5,26-Jun-20,5,"Such a shame it's gone I LOVED this candle.  I got a couple extras, but now I'm afraid to burn them.  It's a soothing, not-overpowering scent that really does help me focus.  I wish they would bring it back."
5,10-Oct-20,5,Nice candle. This was a gift for my daughter.  She loves the scent of the candle.
5,16-Aug-19,5,Wonderful Love this candle it smells wonderful
5,15-Dec-19,3,"Walgreens has it cheaper! Weird smell The product is ok but the smell is a little too much for me, I received a few scents and didn‚Äôt care too much for them. My main issue with this is that it can be found in Walgreens for at least half the price it‚Äôs listed on here."
5,13-Feb-19,5,Calming and Inviting Received as a Christmas gift and I love this candle. Such a calming scent that's lasts for the price.
5,17-Dec-18,5,Thank you Great quality and fast delivery
5,18-Mar-19,5,Smells AMAZING I love this candle and definitely be buying more from here.
5,6-Apr-18,4,"Nice color and smell Light fresh, clean scent. Would purchase again"
5,9-Aug-17,3,"Scent doesn't fill a room. This candle has a very crisp, clean scent. Unfortunately, it's not very powerful. It smells strong when you sniff it unlit, but when burning, it doesn't fill the room with fragrance at all. It's very light. I would expect the smell to spread further lit than unlit, but that isn't what's happening here.This is a pretty candle that can be displayed well with most decor. The peach colored frosted glass container is heavy and well made and the wooden lid is a snazzy touch."
5,12-Oct-20,1,Damaged product This was a gift I purchased for a friend. The candle glass was shattered. Waiting for a replacement.
5,24-May-20,5,This candle makes me happy The scent is clean and calming. It is subtle but radiates throughout my home. I bought the coffee table size as a bit of a lift during my time at home and it is!
5,27-Jan-20,5,Nice Nice candle
5,22-Jan-20,5,It gets rid of the new apartment smells Give this a try! It works out very well and the smell isn't too overpowering. It goes well with glade scents too.
5,11-Feb-18,4,"Good Product Shuttle aroma, very pleasing for any room. Would order again."
5,17-Apr-20,5,Reccommend! Love this candle! Packaged nicely and secured.  Smells great!
5,26-Oct-18,5,"Great scent Christmas gift, by request."
5,26-Jun-18,5,"Best Candle That I Ever Bought I am not one to review things, this is actually my first review on here ever. This was the best candle that I ever had. We have two dogs that can really smell up the house, but this candle masked the smell greatly. Also, it smelled incredible! Bery halpy with the product!"
5,4-Mar-19,5,"Confidence and freedom! I bought this candle in the scent ""confidence and freedom"" on a whim, and holy hell does it pack a punch. The small candle was able to fill nearly my entire house. It smells very nice and earthy, kind of like men's cologne but better! Highly recommend!"
5,27-Aug-20,5,"Great! Calming and relaxing scent. I like that it's not your typical smelling candle, it's different. And I'm really sensitive to lots of smells, but this candle is the bomb."
5,5-Oct-20,5,"Great smell I love this candle, it's my favorite one so far."
5,31-Dec-19,5,Love this candle! Smells amazing! Great size. Love the wooden lid. Would recommend to anybody looking for a great candle.

5,2-Aug-20,1,"Product Arrived Cracked and Quality is Questionable I received this order and it was cracked when it arrived. In addition, the top of the diffuser container doesn't seem to fit properly."
5,22-Feb-19,3,"Scent is not very strong Scent is not very strong, had to put it in my bathroom and since I leave the door open most of the time it‚Äôs not very noticeable."

5,3-Jan-19,5,"Best candle ever, for real. This was gifted to me for christmas. I have a serious fear of fire and never light candles. Got rid of all of them.  I tried this once and now I'm hooked. It is an amazing scent!!"
5,5-Nov-18,2,Not a strong scent Got the Serenity and Calm (lavender thyme) candle and the scent is not very strong. I've been burning it for hours and I can barely smell it. Kind of disappointing :(
5,13-Sep-20,5,"Loved it! This smells amazing, the scent is strong without been overwhelming. Absolutely loved it!"
5,14-Apr-20,1,"No scent Please don't buy or gift this candle, it barely has any smell and with just one wick, it doesn't burn evenly too."
5,20-Mar-19,1,Why spend extra for a non scented candle? I was so disappointed with this buy No scent. Boo!!

5,31-May-17,5,Five Stars Smelled wonderful. Gave it as a birthday gift and they were more than pleased.
5,13-May-18,5,"Buy it. Guys. I don‚Äôt know what ‚Äòpeace and tranquility‚Äô or cashmere are supposed to smell like but somehow they NAILED it. It somehow smells like a luscious white velvet, fancy and relaxing like a ridiculously luxurious spa but without any hint of business, money, or time. This was my second experience buying a candle online without smelling it first and I went with the same brand as my other one was a success as well. I do actually think the scent is worth the price (and I‚Äôm a pretty frugal person) because somehow it relaxes my place while raising how classy it is. It really is tranquil and is an enjoyable candle to have lit while cleaning, snuggling, having guests, taking a bath, etc. I could pretty much have it going 24/7 but don‚Äôt want to use it up too quickly!"
5,12-Mar-18,5,"Level of fragrance really depends on the type of candle you choose! Have ordered 2 of these candles - the Peace + Tranquility (white) and the Reflection + Clarity (light blue).  Both were excellent, but the Peace + Tranquility definitely had a lighter aroma / more subtle than the Reflection + Clarity.  Saw several reviews stating they couldn't smell the candle.  There are 2 likely reasons - 1: if you have a large room/house that you want to smell the candle in, I highly recommend the coffee table jar, which has 3 wicks and smells much stronger than the single wick candles.  However, since it has three wicks, it does burn through faster.  I light mine every night for a couple of hours after dinner while I clean the kitchen and they each lasted about 2-3 weeks with nightly use.  Secondly, it definitely seems to vary with the the fragrance type you use.  The Peace + Tranquility is very light and fresh smelling, but not at all strong.  The Reflection + Clarity is very strong and pleasant, it kind of smells like laundry detergent though (this can be a good or bad thing depending on how you feel about your laundry detergent!).  I have a large house with high ceilings and you can smell the Reflection + Clarity everywhere after being lit 30 minutes or so.  I like to use the R+C type of I make a very strong-smelling dinner (with lots of garlic or onions) where I want to refresh the house.  I use the P+T when I just want a nice calm scent.  I will definitely order again, but will probably try another couple of types since they seem to vary quite a bit..."
5,8-Jun-18,1,"Dangerous Product: Buyer Beware Last night, the glass cracked in apparent heat from the open flame. Glass shards burst all over my floor and nearby bed, and a few cut me. Very disappointed.The company should use a better glass (so that the flame can't crack it). Buyer beware."
5,15-Jan-18,4,"Upper Class Candle A pretty good candle! I was Curious to try out a candle from Chesapeake Bay and I am impressed. I normally go with Yankee Candles but trying out this candle leaves me anxious to try out more options from Chesapeake Bay or at least I expect I will order another ""Reflection + Clarity"" in future times.The scent from this one contains a fare amount of Sage, Very Clean Scent, Upper Class Home?!. Strength is just right, would say about a 70% compared to the strongest candles I have ever experienced.A strong recommendation from me to try this candle."
5,19-Apr-17,4,"Very nice candle Great candle with a smooth scent. I'm sensitive to overpowering, fake scents & this doesn't bother me at all. Beautiful container so I feel comfortable leaving it in place even when not burning. Burns evenly & clean."
5,10-Feb-19,1,"Chesapeake Bay Candle Mind & Body Collection I can't believe I fell for the reviews while chained in Plato's cave! Sunlight, as soon as I lit the wick, my throat became irritated(sore), and the alleged essential oils smelled like a chemical perfumy drugstore bathroom spray. Me, I eat organically and subscribe to Amazon purchased, ""Plant Therapy Essential oils"" folks, this ain't it! Do your due diligence to uncover deceptively advertising, for example, ""WAX BLEND"" translated at least 50% paraffin wax!It has been claimed that paraffin wax releases toxic fumes when burnt, which has contributed to its fall out of favor. In 2009, a study by South Carolina State University found that burning paraffin wax candles give off harmful fumes (toluene and benzene) which is linked to asthma and lung cancer."
5,16-Aug-18,5,"Soft, Mellow Scent I'm normally very picky about candle smells and this is my first candle bought on Amazon, but the smell is NICE. It's very light and clean. Smells almost soapy/floral because of the lily ingredient. I wish I would have known about the coffee table version because the Large size only smells an area radius of about 3 feet from the candle. I might try other scents and sizes just to see how it compares.I would also rebuy the candle because I'm sensitive to candle oils and some cheaper candles with harmful ingredients give me terrible hives and rashes within 5 minutes of burning. With this candle, I can burn it for an hour with no side effect. So that's how I know the candle is worth the price!"
5,9-Feb-18,1,"Might burn your house down The glass is defective., It is a fire & personal safety hazard. When the flame got down to the bottom, the entire glass holding the candle shattered & the flame continued to burn. When I purchase candles, it is an unspoken expectation that the glass is not subject to crack into half a dozen pieces, when near an open flame."
5,23-Sep-18,5,"Amazing candle. I bought the Mind and Body, Balance + Harmony (water lily Pear) candle and it smells amazing! Its not too strong where it  overpowers everything but it is strong enough that you smell it and it gives off such a nice enjoyable smell! I will be buying again for sure, I will also be checking out more Candles from this company. I also want to mention since I see a lot of people asking, the candle arrived inside a box of its own (within the regular amazon delivery box), wrapped in thick packaging paper so unless some one was literally beating your box with a bat the candle wont break, I live in south Florida and the candle was not melted when arrived."
5,19-Aug-18,5,"Great price and smell Was trying out less expensive candles so I really didn‚Äôt have a high bar set- knowing you typically need to spend around 25 for a decent one. Far surpassed my expectations. My family love the way this one smells. I‚Äôve burnt it for about 3-4 days now and it‚Äôs half way thru. Great smell, long lasting and like the modern holder, def will continue to buy!"
5,24-Jul-19,2,"smells like sunshine Smells sublime, burns around 40-50 hours (the last half inch of wax won't burn), remember to trim the wick. Good value -- not the greatest, but arguably it smells better than its competitors, although I'd say it's significantly smokier than the jar candles sold at the grocery (Yankee candle and the like)Edit: decreasing by 2 stars for annoyance factor. I've bought maybe nine of these candles this year (mostly confidence+freedom, although Amazon won't let me rate that one individually), and I'd been mysteriously sneezing, I actually have an appointment to see an allergist in a month, but last week I switched back to a grocery store variety (for no reason other than convenience) and I'm sneezing noticeably less. Now that I'm burning a different candle (brand is Village something) I'm startled by how much less smoke and soot normal candles make. The ash from the Chesapeake Bay Candles actually drifted onto my rug and left black smudges, but I still did not make the connection until I burned something else"
5,27-Mar-20,4,"For the price, I am impressed (4.5 stars)... 4.5 Stars...It doesn't get much worse than a cheap candle. The best part about a cheap candle is that they burn quickly so you don't have to suffer for very long. I had very low expectations for this candle, none really. We needed something to get us through until we were able to get our normal candle and we gave this a go.Excellent all around. The smell wasn't that gross fake scent that you sometimes find, it was pleasant and didn't saturate the entire room. The Peace & Tranquility was light and pleasant, a bit powdery but not overly feminine. Would work for any gender.It lasted for quite some time and burned down evenly. The frosted glass didn't get all sooty and black which drives me nuts.Great candle for the price point. I will be trying other scents."
5,11-Jan-18,5,LOVE IT! I love these candles.  I buy a lot of candles and this is one of my favorites.  Wish it were more readily available.  It's has a clean sweet scent.  Very pleasant.  I walk out of the room and when I walk back in you can smell it right away.  Definitely a favorite and very aromatic.
5,8-Sep-19,1,"Not As Fragrant As I‚Äôd Hoped & Formaldehyde??? I initially thought it may contain Formaldehyde because the white sticker under the wooden lid said 2 compliant for Formaldehyde. I thought that meant there were 2 complaints. It could mean it‚Äôs compliant. Just mentioning Formaldehyde & saying there‚Äôs none ADDED has me feeling uneasy. I‚Äôll skip this one in the future. Just because they haven‚Äôt added it, doesn‚Äôt make me comfortable there‚Äôs none in there to begin with. Why is Formaldehyde even mentioned? I checked. Most scented candles contain limonene, which when burned releases Formaldehyde into the air. Look for candles without this, open a window & there are even certain houseplants that suck the Formaldehyde out of the air. Many, if not all, Air Fresheners contain this as well. Do some research. It‚Äôs important. Be well."
5,10-Aug-20,1,"No Scent Whatsoever! The frosted jar and wooden cap are very appealing.  The candle, not so much.  There isn't any fragrance or scent whatsoever.  Very disappointing as this was to be a birthday present.  I would be embarrassed to give this to anyone, especially when you know the person will lift the lid and breathe in the aroma . . . in this there would be none.  I wish Newell Brands who makes Chesapeake Bay would have been forthcoming and state this candle has a VERY light scent (that's being polite) that should be used in a small room or bathroom.  The tons of positive ratings is what made me try this company and candle but I was duped.  Good news is the Coco Benjamin Honeysuckle and Jasmine soy candle gave off a delightful and fragrant scent.  See, something good did come out of this."
5,18-Nov-20,4,Great smell but one big issue This candle smelt fantastic however!!! ONE GIANT ISSUE** our dog had an allergic reaction to candle eyes swelling etc so we passed it on to another household figuring our little guy just was sensitive.. they lit the candle today and their dog also had an allergic reaction to the Candle. Chiweenie and a German shepard so very different dogs. Just be careful who you buy these for because it may be anballergy trigger for someone who has dogs. Candle had a wonderful scent though so its a shame.
5,22-Mar-19,1,"Waste of money Somehow I missed in the product description this coffee table candle was a 3-wick candle (which I dislike immensely: had I known that, I would not have purchased it), but even with 3 wicks burning for exactly one hour as of this writing, I can't smell it at all - not in any room and definitely not in the kitchen where it is sitting on my stove (for safety reasons being the first time I've used this product/brand). I placed it on my stove in my extremely tiny kitchen and I am standing right next to the stove hand washing dishes in the sink and there is absolutely no scent-throw (Courage and Wisdom). It smelled wonderful when I removed the wooden lid, but I can't walk around sniffing a candle I'm carrying around with me all day. Extremely disappointed after reading so many amazing reviews. I won't buy again, I won't recommend it, and I won't let it finish burning for the second hour of burn time. (Tiny writing on the bottom label cautions a burn time of only 2 hours at a time, which is another detail I must have missed in the description). Complete waste of money. So happy I didn't buy it as a gift for someone: I'd be extremely embarrassed."
5,4-Dec-19,5,"A little sniff of happy in every whiff! This candle smells amazing! As a mom with two children under 2 and 3 dogs, the fresh, clean smell of this candle goes a very long way! I purchased the medium candle in the peace and tranquility scent. And although nothing could bring peace and tranquillity to my household when everyone is home, the smell of this candle sure does make me happy!Pros: I love the smell. The candle doesn‚Äôt tunnel at all. I‚Äôve burned it at least 3 times from anywhere from 1-10 hours and there‚Äôs no tunneling. The candle also looks practically new, so I can tell it‚Äôs going to last a long time. It also just has a classic, clean look to it so you can add it to any type of decor.This candle would make a great gift for someone and I will definitely be purchasing more.Cons: So far nothing! I will update if I can think of anything."
5,15-Sep-20,1,"I'm so confused- I smell nothing. I am wildly confused. So many reviews say these smell so good. I have the pineapple coconut one, and it's been burning for 2 hours 5 feet from me. I smell nothing. I legit wondered if my sense of smell is gone or something. I go in and spray some glade spray into the air, I smell it immediately. I smell cologne I spray into the air. With this candle, unless it's a bad one (how would that be possible?), I smell absolutely nothing at all. I was waiting for pineapple and coconut to fill the room, but nothing.It looks like it would burn a long time, as it's fairly tall and filled to near the top, but it's pointless without any smell. Pretty disappointed. I tried the glade candles and they smell like nothing as well. Figured these being more expensive and from Yankee Candle they had to be better. Nope."
5,12-Jan-20,4,"Frosted Glass is Nice I bought the white/cream 'peace & tranquility"" in the medium size with a coupon for just under $10. It has a light smell to me, which is a little flowery. Glad to have them (bought 4) on hand during the possible snow storm this week. They're kind of burning fast, Im using two at a time. So I'll probably go through them all this week. I was interested in the frosted glass feature after having a ""beautiful home"" candle from Target which also had like cream wax and a white jar and the light/flame got to showing through the jar and looked nice. Which there were more frosted glass candle options on the market! You might consider this a nice gift option."
5,25-Dec-18,2,"Nice candle. The scent of the pineapple coconut is nice but not strong. I have purchased multiple scents from this company and have been very happy with all, but scent was not as strong as the ""water lily pear"" or the ""lemongrass eucalyptus"". Also, candle says to not burn more than two hours and to keep wick trimmed... not sure if this is why people's candles are breaking."
5,27-May-19,5,"Fills the room with a very appealing and not overpowering aroma I‚Äôve never purchased a candle where so many  guests ask me where they can buy  one. It burns cleanly, the aroma is distinct yet not distracting and it fills a room with a subtle yet still noticeable scent. It‚Äôs my favorite summer candle.. We can eat a meal in the same room  and not be overpowered by a scent so strong  that it affects our  enjoyment of the food ( ( unlike cinnamon or spice scented candles). This is a light summery scent, evoking images- at least to me- of  warm  breezes, newly mown grass  ( although it doesn‚Äôt smell grassy) , and days spent lolling outside, reading a book or dining on the porch , patio, or deck with friends.Peace and tranquility are apt descriptions. This review was not solicited and I purchased this candle at full price. I have no connection to this company ."
5,21-Oct-20,5,"Great smell and I normally dislike candles I usually dislike the intense and fake smells that candles put off, but these smell very nice. I bought them as a gift and they were very well received. The container is a nice solid smoked glass and the top is a nice wood. They smell pretty great for candles and don't give off a smokey smell like other candles do. They are quite hefty and I think they will last a long time. They make a great gift!"
5,9-Dec-19,3,"Very unhappy to receive this candle in a Yankee Candle box. I have no idea if the candle is good or not...bought as a gift for my daughter who loves candles & has had many brands...like Yankee Candle etc.  I thought the description & look of this candle was very appealing & something different that she would like.  When it arrived in a Yankee Candle box I thought it was a mistake, but no....inside the good sized Yankee Candle box was the smaller, sad & lonely looking  Chesapeake  Bay candle.  I can only imagine her confused look if I had used this labeled Yankee Candle to wrap her gift.  Very very poor presentation  & not sure who is responsible. I buy a lot from Amazon, & cannot remember ever getting  any order marked with anything than Amazon."
5,29-Mar-19,5,"Chesapeake Bay's Best Scent: Balance & Harmony Balance & Harmony is the best scent by far. I have smelled other candles at Target and the scent really lives up to its name. I first gifted the same scent as a candle to my mom and this diffuser for a friend, and I have received compliments from both. The packaging is beautiful, the scent is refreshing, and if you work in an office space or something similar where open flames are not an option, the diffuser works well. You can somewhat control how strong you want the scent to be by how many reeds you use and how often you flip the reeds (the most often, the stronger the scent). It looks great in any setting and I'm thinking of getting one for myself as well!"
5,9-Aug-19,4,"Slow burn! Scent is ok. The candles are nice. I got a large and a medium...orange and blue (I can't remember the scents). They burn slowly... LOVE THAT. I spend quite a bit on candles. So with the price and slow burn, this candle wins ?üëç.  The only thing I'm not super stoked about is they don't throw the scent. You've got to be standing pretty close to smell it. Although the room I've got it sitting in, is a very large room. But the large candle can't cover much of it. I'll be buying again, tho.The scents are also pleasant, but not my style. I like perfumy stuff and these are more natural scents. Can't beat the price for a slow burn. They small good."
5,10-Mar-20,3,"Why can't I purchase an oil refill?!?!! I love this product and hate that I have to do this but I'm giving it 3 stars instead of 5 because of how pathetic it is that they do not sell the specific oil fragrances as standalone refills. First of all, this forces customers to spend an excessive amount of money if they want to continue to use the product and buy the whole glass and reeds (both of which are very nice by the way). Second of all it is a waste of product and terrible for the environment! I hope to see the oils being offered soon so I can change this to a 5 star review and happily continue to enjoy the reed diffuser."
5,20-Oct-20,5,"Very well package I love scented candles. I usually buy from bath and bodyworks, but they're sale was over when it was time for a replacement candle. B&B candles on sale is $15 for the 3 wick candles but $25 non-sale price. So I searched Amazon and found this candle by chesapeake. I purchased the cashmere & jasmine. It smells amazing! Also read a few reviews about customers candles being poorly package, but me order was package very well. Couldn't be happier, I will definitely be buying more. Not sure how accurate the burn time is. 3 wick 24hrs they say, but we'll see"
5,3-Feb-20,4,"Pretty piece, smells nice This is a pretty piece and I would love to give it 5 stars but the top comes off extremely easily.  If it were knocked over the top would come off and spill over the whole countertop.  Because of this, I only filled it up an inch.  The smell is nice, not my favorite but it's a chance when you buy a scented item online.  I personally wouldn't give it as a gift simply because I would feel terrible should it spill but it's pretty enough that it would make a lovely gift.  I also like that the sticks are a dark color, it gives it a classier look."
5,25-Feb-18,5,"I was very pleased to find them on amazon Originally purchased candles at Target. I went back for more several times. After 4th purchase, Target had them on clearance w/no future purchases. I was very pleased to find them on amazon. The fragrance is very mild (I suffer w/allergies) and tranquil. I like the fact that these candles burn completely w/little to no wax left over. I've purchased other brands (more expensive than this brand) and had alot of wax left after the wick burned out."
5,15-Aug-19,3,"Nice clean candle, disappointing scent. I buy candles to have ‚Äúaroma therapy‚Äù. When it arrived I thought the scent was nice. Unfortunately after I lit it, I no longer could detect any scent. I like to burn a candle in my bedroom at night and so far it has burned 2 nights. It has a nice clean, even flame, and the candle has aready burned a long time with over half the candle. If you only want a good candle to burn it‚Äôs great, but I purchased it for the nonexistent scent. So the poor review."
5,20-Dec-18,3,"Nice Fragrance About the Awaken and Invigorate --I like the scent. I don't love it, but it's good. Smells rather soapy to me.About  the Confidence and Freedom candle-- It is quite lovely. Great smell. This one I highly recommend."
5,16-May-20,5,"If you like lavender and a string scent you will love this camdle!!!!! This is probably one of the strongest lavender candles I have ever bought. It is amazing!! Worked through out all 3 levels of my house. I tried one of the other scents from this company, but the lavender was the only one that worked for me. It is a wonderful scent and as I mentioned earlier, it is strong! Which is exactly what I wanted. I would buy more, but the 3 wick lavender keeps selling out. LOL!  Next time, I will be stocking up.Try it...if you like lavender and strong scented candles...you will love it!"
5,14-Oct-20,4,"Scent not as strong.. Love theses candles.. Haven‚Äôt bought in awhile but notice the serenity +calm(lavender thyme) was on sale so I ordered 3, 2 for Birthday presents & one for me. The price was nearly half.. Got candles but couldn‚Äôt really smell?!?! I lit it has a hint of smell. Don‚Äôt remember in the past this happening?? I had also ordered reflection + clarity which I could smell really good..Maybe that‚Äôs why the serenity+calmon sale??I will keep buying this brand  but maybe not this flavor which I‚Äôve loved in the past.."
5,5-Oct-20,1,"Disappointed I had such high hopes of these candles. I read the reviews over and over to find a scent that I believe would be to my liking. I live in Jamaica West Indies so it took a few days to get to me, so you can imagine my excitement when it finally arrived. I got the items at work and without hesitation I ""Bust"" the box open to get my scented candles. When I opened the candles, you could barely smell anything..being a candle amateur, I thought that maybe I had to light the candles to smell it. As soon as I got home, I lit the candle, NOTHING. So I put it into a smaller bedroom still NOTHING, so I put it into a smaller bathroom still NOTHING. I'm so DISAPPOINTED cause to get it to Jamaica I had to pay an additional fee.. I may try it again though in a different scent.. MAYBE"
5,17-Nov-19,5,Really nice subtle smell I am not a big candle person but I now work in a school and know that middle schoolers aren't always the best smelling people on Earth (smelly gym socks anyone?). I got this to see if I could add a nice but not overpowering scent to my office. When the candle came in I actually ended up gifting this to a parent (a wonderful parent BTW) and we opened it before she left. It had a nice subtle scent and the packaging was really nice. Made her happy. And isn't that what life is all about?
5,22-Nov-17,5,Chesapeake Bay Reflection and Clarity Candle We really enjoy Chesapeake Bay candles. They easily fill the room but are not overpowering. The wooden lid makes the candle look nice when not in use. The reflection and clarify scent is a smooth and calming scent.
5,3-Sep-20,4,"Better than I expected! I am a Yankee Candle fan...I rarely deviate from the candle.  I was trying to find the Vanilla scented candle and  this product popped up ...it was reasonably priced and it was a local company in MD.Upon arriving,  I could smell the candle from outside the box And I thought it would be too overpowering.Actually, It is a beautiful candle - beautifully made And you can tell by the design that a lot of care was taken in making this product.The smell is subtle  - its fragrance is sweet and refreshing -not over powering or too perfumed.I was and am pleasantly pleased."
5,21-Apr-20,1,"No scent whatsoever. I‚Äôm into aromatherapy, and the effect a particular fragrance can have on ones well~being.  Looking to duplicate the tranquillity of a spa experience, I decided from its description to give this candle a try.  When I say you couldn‚Äôt smell anything at all, whether straight out of its box or lit, that would be completely accurate (the box is so pretty it comes in I had high expectations for its contents).  I had no option but to return it.  Perhaps it was just a bad batch, but I wasn‚Äôt willing to make a second purchase."
5,16-Jun-20,2,"Great...if you can get it in one piece I love the product...but it is near impossible to get it delivered in one piece. I ordered one, got it, loved it. I have tried two times to get another one and both times it showed up broken. If you can, I would suggest buying in person and skip the hassle of having to return/re-order multiple times"
5,23-Sep-19,4,"Smells great! I purchased Mediterranean Citrus and it smells lovely. Sweet but fresh, like a just-peeled mandarin orange. The jar comes empty with a plastic bottle of oil that is capped so it won't leak in transit. I only filled the jar halfway and used 4 of the included reeds, since I am using it in a small bathroom, and it's working well. It will last longer that way, too. The blue container is lovely and I intend to refill it with my own oil mixtures once I run out."
5,26-Nov-17,5,"Wonderful smell This company has certainly become my favorite candle company. I even prefer it over Yankee (which I absolutely loved), these candles burn evenly. I love the glass jars they come in over the tin. The wooden top I use as the holder while the candle is burning to still give it a great style, I have a candle burning in every room. The mind & body collection is a great collection, I love the fragrances of the collection and they can make a couple of my rooms smell heavenly. I"
5,17-Jun-20,1,Don't buy Smells terrible
5,18-Mar-19,4,"Clean and Slow Burning The white one smells pretty soapy, not what I'd call tranquil and kind of off-putting after a an hour or 2 of burning. The pink one smells fruity and soft. I prefer the scent of the pink one. Both are slow burning and clean (no black soot/smoke). I will order more because the quality is good.  I would like to sample the other scents."
5,3-Sep-18,5,OMG such a wonderful scent and long-lasting! You can't beat this price for such long-lasting wonderful smelling candle!  I've tried 4 different scents so far and they are just delicious!  Highly recommend if you love keeping your house smelling heavenly :)
5,30-Dec-18,5,"Perfectly, long-lasting scent This candle was initially given as a gift and I was immediately in love that I searched and purchased it. The scent is not overpowering and it sends an evenly smooth aroma throughout the apartment.  Considering how sensitive I am to scents due to my allergies,  this was a great candle to come across."
5,16-Oct-20,5,"LOVE IT Bought this for my gf and quickly found me being the one who is always lighting it up to smell the awesome scent. I love this thing! She loves it to. The scent is not overpowering. It is very subtle and calming but invigorating at the same time. Hope that makes sense. lol. Needless to say, me and my girl are HUGE fans and I now am going to buy the large one. Definitely have no problem recommending."
5,8-May-20,3,"My Item Came Broken, but It Smells Amazing! Bought this product before everything really got intense with Covid-19. My product arrived broken, and by then Amazon was in full Covid-19 mode and could not respond to my customer service request. I ended up using another type of container for the liquid and diffuser sticks and it smells very good. It‚Äôs not over powering. It was the perfect thing for my water closet that doesn‚Äôt have any outlets for wax melts (which probably would have been too overpowering anyway). I think I will purchase this again because it smells that good. I‚Äôll just assume the glass bottle will come broken. Because of this, I would not recommend this item as a gift."
5,9-Nov-17,5,"Mint + Basil = Lovely!! Very much enjoying the Chesapeake Bay Candle Mind & Body Collection Coffee Table Jar Scented Candle, Simplicity + Hope.  The scent is Mint + Basil.  I've burned two times now.  The first time I burned the candle I didn't notice a scent - UNTIL I left the room and returned.  I LOVE IT!  The scent was filled the room without being overwhelming.  The jar is attractive, too.  I am going to be looking into buying some holiday scents."
5,10-Mar-19,2,"Great smell, short lasting Listen, the smell is subtle and you do feel a nice sense of calm. It burns a long time, the container is super cute and possibly reusable... But... In order to get the smell you have to be within 3 feet of the candle. I have a small office area I use it for and the smell does NOT last! I'm not sure if it's the same with all candle sizes or if I just got an outlier. I'm willing to try the largest size to see if it makes a difference or not and will update my review then."
5,7-Jun-19,5,"Mother‚Äôs Day I made my mom a gift basket for Mother‚Äôs Day this year & decided to include this candle for it. At first I was wary of doing it because my mom is SUPER picky about scents. She‚Äôs sensitive to strong scents & will frequently get headaches if it‚Äôs too strong. On top of that, she doesn‚Äôt like very many scents. So I bought this candle based on reviews & what it should smell like, hoping for the best. I‚Äôm glad I did - she absolutely loves it! So now I‚Äôm thinking about getting one for myself!!"
5,14-Dec-19,4,"Fantastic scent This is the best candle I‚Äôve ever bought, scent-wise. I don‚Äôt know if it is because the wax is soy, but you smell the scent, not the wax. (Unlike yankee candle, who incidentally, bought this company and brand, too.)My only complaint is that the candles burn very quickly. They only last for about 5 hours. Still, at $14, they are a better value than yankee candle and if you want a delicious fresh softly fruity scent, this is for you."
5,22-Dec-19,5,"Great Craftsmanship! I really love these candles, they were a substitute for the White Barn candles I usually buy. I was skeptical at first but the craftsmanship is fantastic, the scent is nice and strong but not overpowering. The life of the wick is quite long and the scent perfectly perfumes my bedroom. And it's costs the same as a White Barn candle but is bigger so that's a great bargain too!"
5,31-May-20,2,"Disappointed by strength of the scent I bought this for my bedroom which is about 11x11'. Even after leaving the candle burning for several hours there is barely any scent in the room. I have bought many candles in the past, usually just random brands from Target, and their scent is generally much stronger than this. The candle is lasting a long time, which is about the only positive so far. The scent I bought was confidence+freedom."
5,18-Oct-20,5,"So Far So Good Ordered two candles and they were very, very well packaged.  Can smell them without even taking the lid off.  Will wait for them to reach room temp before burning them.  They are very attractive and not cutesy - just elegant looking.  The price was outstanding.  So, will see how they burn, but right now I am totally sold on this brand and the wonderful fragrance selection."
5,1-Apr-19,1,"I thought this was all natural? Not what I expected I bought this thinking it was 100% natural.  Maybe I missed something in the description?  I have asthma. Artificial-toxic fragrances cause me to have an asthma attack. This candle sends me into an asthma attack and I can‚Äôt  use it.  Even if it didn‚Äôt cause an asthma attack, the fragrance is terrible, It‚Äôs very strong and harsh. It‚Äôs a complete fail in my book."
5,3-Sep-20,3,Smells absolutely wonderful but doesn't last long. My balance and harmony candle arrived earlier than expected and was in perfect condition. The smell is amazing! However this candle didn't even last a week burning only a couple hours a day. I got a medium size and thought it would last at least a couple weeks but it only lasted 6 days... I'm pretty disappointed about the life of the candle but it smells great while it lasts.
5,9-Jun-19,5,"Hubby asked for this again and again. In the small guest bathroom that we originally used this, the scent was just so inviting.  My husband really enjoyed it and asked for it to be used in our larger master bathroom.  The scent wasn't quite as strong so will do better in smaller rooms.  The only real downside that I cannot understand is why they don't make a refill oil available instead of asking their customers to repurchase this purple glass container each and every time the scent needs refilling."
5,11-May-20,5,"Very syrupy sweet scent These are long lasting and good quality candles- I‚Äôve purchased them in a few different scents. I love the other scents but was not a fan of this one. To me, it‚Äôs a little sickeningly sweet/fruity. A friend took it home with her when we burned it one night and she loves it so it just wasn‚Äôt the right scent for me. If you like sugary sweet smell, you‚Äôll love it."
5,1-Aug-20,1,Don't Buy This Extremely upset.  Order 4 of these ( two different scents) and got the first two.  The container that holds the liquid cracked and apparently you can't request any type of return (I understand that because of flammable liquid) or replacements.  Which I don't understand why.  Paid a lot of money for a broken merchandise.  I love their candles but not giving them any more of my money after this.
5,26-Apr-20,2,"To be fair, it's not a bad item at all The problem with this item is it made my pets sick.  I have an adult pug and we couldn't figure out what was making him so sick, then we finally put two and two together, it started when we added this diffuser.  We got rid of it and the problems resolved almost instantly.The scent and longevity of these is actually not bad.  It's definitely giftable, I just can't give it a higher rating because it made my dog sick."
5,13-Aug-20,2,"Don‚Äôt buy unless you like lemongrass cleaning products The scent started nice, like a minty, lemongrass, eucalyptus smell you would find in a nice spa or gym. After a few hours it became an overpowering lemongrass scent that smelled like cleaning products. Moved it from one room to another and now in the garage. I figured it could cover some pet odors (which I realized as I was carrying it to throw it away). Don‚Äôt buy."
5,5-Feb-19,5,Smells delicious! It‚Äôs hard to buy a candle without smelling it first but I know that this brand is highly rated and I heard that Yankee Candle is acquiring the company so that gave me the confidence to go ahead and place my order. I just received it and it was well wrapped and I lit it almost immediately (after trimming the wick as recommended).This scent ‚ÄúLove + Passion‚Äù was exactly what I was hoping for. It‚Äôs fruity and clean without any overwhelming floral notes. I hope to burn it daily and will likely purchase a couple more!
5,26-Sep-18,3,"Good, not great I‚Äôm not impressed. When the candle arrived, the wax was very uneven. Now the candle is burning unevenly. The smell isn‚Äôt too strong-which I like but it‚Äôs a little too leathery for my taste. I don‚Äôt love the smell but my boyfriend does. I also expected the candle to be a lot bigger than it actually was."
5,10-May-20,4,(Updated) Can barely smell it. ***UPDATE*** I have been using this in my small study and have to say it is much more noticeable in small spaces. It would be nice for people who are sensitive to strong scents. Also nice for yoga or meditation in small spaces. Updating to 4 stars but would be still preferred something more noticeable.I can barely smell anything when it's lit. It's a big scent when you hold your nose to the unlit candle but barely a thing when lit. Very sad.
5,25-Aug-20,5,"Nice clean scent, not overpowering, not flowery. My favorite candle scent. I don't have a ton of candle buying experience, but my wife and I both like this one. It has a clean scent that isn't heavy and it reminds me of the beach a bit. I like the large size with the single wick vs. the coffee table size with three wicks because the scent isn't as strong. It also lasts quite a long time."
5,19-Jan-20,3,Nice candle but lacks fragrance punch Purchased this candle as the scent was noted as similar to Capri Blue however does not pack the same punch in that it really doesn‚Äôt smell very strong.  I like to be able to light one candle and the smell is present throughout the house.  Not the case with this one.  It does have a clean citrus smell similar to Capri blue or Sun Washed Citrus at B&B but was disappointing in it‚Äôs potency.
5,20-Jan-20,2,"Glass imperfection I like Chesapeake Bay candles, this scent in particular, but I usually buy them from target.  My product came dirty, and there is some sort of debris embedded in the glass with a bump in the glass around it. I tried to remove it but it just made the frosted glass look bad. I don‚Äôt feel like going through the hassle of returning, but I expect more for $20 and would not recommend buying this here"
5,31-Aug-18,5,I love this candle! This is my absolute favorite scent from Chesapeake Bay however it burns pretty quickly and is not as strong as i would like for a big area. But it works well in my bedroom and that's a decent size too so it works.
5,31-Jan-19,4,Not my cup of tea but great customer service Ordering candles over the internet can be a crap shoot.  Unfortunately I was expecting something Cedar-ish smelling but this is more of a cologne smell and very strong.  The jar and lid are very attractive though and the seller issued a refund without requiring me to return the product.  Maybe I can find something else from their shop that is more my speed.Thanks!
5,12-Aug-19,5,Not over-powering Fragrance engulfs the entire office at work. Everyone loves the scent. The candle burns evenly and will last a long time. Make sure you trim the wick each time before use.
5,29-Mar-19,4,"Great value for the amount of usage hours, very light scent I burn this candle just about everyday for at least 30min a day (up to several hours). It's gorgeous looking, and you get a LOT of burn time for only $10ish dollars. I bought this at least 6 months ago after I finished off a bath and body works candle and I'm only halfway through it.I took off one star because the smell is way too light. I like heavier-smelling candles that smell natural or fruity and this one is a bit too light even to fill a 10?ó9 room."
5,24-Jun-19,1,"Not sure what the big deal with these are...or why all the good reviews.... BUT, I'm not happy at all with these.  The scent is barely noticeable, unless you stick you face up to them and breathe it in.  The burn is so/so.. but not as even as described.  I will say the longevity is there....but I don't burn it much since I'm fairly disappointed in it.  I haven't tried the second one yet;  For the money,  i'd try something else."
5,17-Feb-19,4,"Very Strong, Masculine Scent Giving this 4 stars as the scent is incredibly masculine, and based on the description I expected something more gender-neutral. It‚Äôs very pretty in my office at work, though I do recommend removing about half of the reeds if you‚Äôre putting it in a small space. A good product, but I bought it because it looks nice - will refill with a less expensive and softer scent in the same vein."
5,24-Apr-20,5,"AHHHH I love candles and since I couldn't go out shopping for some I decided to try online.  Not my first choice, since I need to smell a candle to see if I like it.  But based on the reviews, I took a chance and oh my this is lovely.  It smells fresh vs floral.  Very happy about this and will definitely reorder when the time comes.Side note, I'm very frugal on how much money I spend on candles since it's like burning money.  Normally I wouldn't spend this much on a candle but I REALLY love to have pleasant scents floating about the house and this was absolutely worth it."
5,21-May-20,3,"Not what I was hoping for I bought this (scent un-smelled) based on the large number of positive reviews and because it was a best seller on Amazon. The description of a 'cranberry dahlia' scent (aka 'joy and laughter') had me hoping that it would be a light and pleasant scent. Not that it's exactly unpleasant, but it's much stronger and it is a lot sweeter smelling than I anticipated. Maybe it's just not for me. I prefer a lighter scent, and definitely not sweet."
5,29-Jan-20,5,"WOW! The Mediterranean Citrus smells good... Let me start off by saying that I am EXTREMELY picky with scents, and it's not often that I find one that I truly love. I took a risk on ordering this one for the bathroom, figuring that if I hated it, at least it was just in one small part of the house... but the minute I smelled it I was in love. The Mediterranean Citrus is so fresh and clean smelling without smelling like cheap bathroom cleaner or Lysol. It's so good! I have a small bathroom and it has no problem spreading around, but the smell is not overpowering (and I'm sensitive to smells). Anyway, give this one a shot!"
5,31-Jul-20,5,"Superior to all others Being a candle snob, I was skeptical about this candle for such a reasonable price. When I received it, Candle Nirvana!!  The smell is divine , the jar is just lovely, burns evenly , the price is crazy good. What more do you want???Buy this candle for you or a gift. It will help with COVID anxiety, I promise."
5,8-May-19,1,"Smells like cheap shampoo Peace & Tranquility smells nothing like the description upon opening it up and smelling it. (It might smell better when burned, but then I wouldn't be able to return it.) It smells sort of fruity. Florals are definitely not the main notes. I find it abrasive and overly sweet - pretty much the opposite of peace and tranquility."
5,16-Jun-18,5,"Quality candle at an affordable price This review is for the Balance + Harmony candle. The scent is quite subtle, which is nice. Unlike some candles (I‚Äôm looking at you, B&BW), one isn‚Äôt assaulted by the scent after burning it for a few hours. I‚Äôve used this candle in rooms ranging from the living room to the bathroom, just depending on if I‚Äôm hosting a party, cleaning, or just hanging about. I highly recommend this scent (I can‚Äôt speak for the others), especially considering the excellent value."
5,6-Jan-20,5,"Such a soft, soothing smell! Love love love this fragrance!  It's very easy to smell (not harsh or overly strong) and really was ""that calming scent"" I went looking for.  I ordered the two medium sizes, which are not idea for a larger living room space - but perfect for smaller area like a bathroom or bedroom.  Highly recommend."
5,3-Aug-19,1,"Not worth the price These candles have no smell.  I have been burning for over an hour and smell nothing.  Also, 2 of the three in the pack smell like men‚Äôs cologne. Do not waste your money so disappointing."
5,2-Mar-19,5,"Great Scent I bought this as a gift for someone, not knowing what it would smell like. When I received it I smelled to make sure I wanted to give it as a gift. The scent is so calming, smooth, and subtle. It smells like sweet blooming flowers and fresh air. The glass is very thick and the top feels like actual wood. It is a great candle to keep or give as gift!!"
5,25-Jan-18,5,"Candle Collection Delivered on time. Candle is heavier than expected, which is nice. The scent is amazing and lingers. I own the cranberry scent from this collection as well. A bit pricey but I do believe is worth it."
5,31-Jul-18,5,"wonderful! I was taking a total chance buying this without knowing the scent, and I am glad that I did. It smells amazing. Great product! Thank you!"
5,14-Oct-20,2,"Pass. Doesn‚Äôt scent up even a little bit. Super disappointing considering all of the great reviews. Unsure of whether quality is inconsistent between candles, but I ordered a smaller one that doesn‚Äôt work well either. Really pretty presentation but a waste of money if you want to smell anything."
5,11-Jun-19,5,"Chesapeake Bay Candle Scented Candle Balance + Harmony, a very beautiful calming scent, wishing only that the scent was just a little stronger. The Candle burn very well, very even as you can see by the photos, I do burn candle just about every night when watching TV, I most important is that you want to trim the wick each time before lighting, or you get the black smoke, as most candles. It comes in a frost like glass, very beautiful."
5,26-Oct-20,2,No discernable scent So when it's unlit and you smell it in the jar it smells good but when it's burning there is literally no fragrance.  I tried it on a candle warmer plate to see if that helped but it didn't.  It might as well just be an unscented candle because there is no scent profile when burned.
5,24-Aug-20,2,"Smells artificial and bothersome I have no idea what people are taking about. This is like one of my first candles. And I am disappointed. It smells artificial and bothersome. I moved it to the balconyI am used to using all kinds of oils in my diffuser including orange oil (which is used in this candle) and I generally love them. So, not sure what‚Äôs going on here"
5,6-Mar-19,4,"Beautifully made but very subtle scent I've ordered other scents from this candle brand before and what I like the most from these candles is their lingering scents that can fill a room. However, this particular scent (Water Lily Pear) is a lot more subtle which can be good if you have a sensitive nose and are looking for something comforting but lighter. I'll probably stick with the other scents but this is still a very good quality product."
5,4-Feb-19,1,"Buyer beware--No reeds in package I was encouraged by the good reviews of this diffuser. Unfortunately, when I opened the package today, there weren't any reeds inside (kind of an essential piece of the puzzle with this product)!! My 11-year-old  already had opened the oil and dumped it into the glass piece, or I'd be returning. Frustrating. I've learned my lesson-I'll stick to my usual brand of diffusers in the future."
5,8-Jun-20,1,"Great if you like the smell of gas I thought I was going to love this. It smells great unlit , however once you lit the wicks your room will fill full of a kerosene smell .  I thought at first, it would go away , maybe the wicks needed time to burn something off . Boy, was I was wrong . I just ended up nauseous and with a migraine."
5,3-Nov-18,4,"Smells AMAZING! Shattered at the end.... I burned this candle quite often because it smelled wonderful and the frosted glass gave a nice glow. I guess I burned it a bit too long though, as when it was out of wax it shattered. I've burned many candles down to the end but this was a first. It broke into about 3 or 4 pieces so it wasn't too terrible to clean up. I'm buying another, I'll just stop burning at a quarter inch left!"
5,6-Aug-20,1,"Disappointed The scent is so weak! Even sticking my face in the candle, the scent is so faint... Would‚Äôve expected way more from a Yankee, especially with the reviews."
5,17-Oct-17,4,"Love the scent, but so weak! I love love love the Peace & Tranquility scent, but all of the candles & diffusers are SO weak.  I want it to fill my house, or at least a medium-sized room, but I can only smell it if I'm within 10ft.  I'd just buy one large one for every room, but they are far too expensive."
5,30-May-20,1,"Hardly any scent at all. Nice packaging, but there's virtually no fragrance to this candle.  I previously tried the Lulu brand lemongrass candle which smelled amazing throughout my entire first floor, and I was hoping this cheaper brand would work too.  It doesn't - and I won't be rebuying.  You get what you pay for - I'll stick with Lulu brand."
5,12-Feb-20,4,"Good moderately scented candle I like this candle well enough. I was wanting something super strongly scented to burn in my kitchen to help cover food cooking smells. It‚Äôs ok, but not as strong as I‚Äôd hoped. I googled strongest scented home candles. This one came up so I tried it. A plus is that I burn a lot & it‚Äôs lasting awhile. It also burns evenly."
5,30-Aug-20,2,"No scent at all This candle smells like nothing. It has no scent and basically smell like a defective candle..maybe its old or expired but it doesn't have any scent.  Basically it smells like hot wax.I'm not saying don't buy it, but beware you may receive one that's defective."
5,14-May-19,2,"Doesnt smell like anything when lit Doesnt smell like anything when lit. I kept one and gifted another thinking they would be nice candles. They smell great when you put your nose up to them, but the didnt distribute ANY scent at all into my tiny bathroom. Buy something from a store you know Is legit. I just.dont think what I got is are real CB candles."
5,19-Dec-17,5,"Mildly scented - great for sensitive noses! I love these candles. Beautifully made with very good scents. I love that they are not overly scented, which allows them to be lit for a long time without annoyingly strong smells."
5,16-Jan-18,5,Five Stars Bloody thing smells great! If your a dude get it nice scent.
5,28-Jan-19,5,Secret Santa Gift `I purchased this as a gift for a secret Santa gift giving I was involved in. I never got to see the actual candle as I had Amazon send it out of state for the person who's name I chose. I hope she liked it as I decided on a Chesapeake Bay candle because I personally own several and love them!! Sorry I can't give more of a review but I will say they are one of the best candles you can purchase!
5,5-Sep-18,5,"Great scent, beautiful packaging! I have gotten both Peace and Tranquility, and Balance and Harmony. The teal is a fresh fruity scent, not too overpowering, and the white is a lovely clean and soothing scent. The wooden lid on the glass jar is so nice! Will definitely be buying again!"
5,11-Nov-20,2,"Burns nicely but little to no scent It's a pretty candle but it has almost zero throw- if you are looking for scent, this ain't it.Edited to add- I am burning it just for the light and now the wick has moved off center to such a degree that it will be impossible to burn evenly. Garbage."
5,29-Apr-20,1,"Nice look but you can barely smell the candle I purchased the candles because of the scent and the look.  I purchased a total of 4 with plans to gift them.  I lit one of them and placed in my office and could barely smell it. I closed the door and let it burn for hours and it barely had a scent. I like Yankee candles and have purchased them in the past because if the strong, warm and welcoming scent however, the casing is not always the best. This was a better casing but goodness no real scent to any of the four I purchased. Too bad I lit them or I would have asked for a refund or exchange."
5,16-Dec-19,5,"For a gift basket This year I recommended to my wife that we should build our own ladies' aromatherapy Christmas gift baskets. We included these lovely candles that were highly recommended by Amazon buyers. The assortment of scents and ""purpose"" creates a perfect theme basket."
5,11-Sep-20,1,"Zero lavender scent. Real waste of money. Currently have been burning it for an hour and zero scent in my small living room. Usually I make purchases based off of reviews, this time the good reviews were very misleading. Spend more money on a good candle, or you will spend this much for nothing."
5,4-Nov-20,1,Does not stay lit. The flame keeps on dying all the time and if its on its super small and does not even release any aroma.Wanted to return but who returns a candle that has been lit.Sad as I was really looking forward to this candle and money lost. Cest la vie ?üò¢
5,11-Apr-20,3,"I got multiple scents, some are better than others The water lily pear scent is amazing! however the other scents I got were not so great. the rose water scent smells like a dirty bathroom that someone just sprayed air freshener in. The cashmere jasmine scent is also unfortunately in the same category as the rose water scent."
5,7-Jun-19,5,"Can't wait to try the others! I love that these candles have a vibe to them. I received the Awaken and Rejuvenate candle, which is lemongrass eucalyptus scent. It wasn't overpowering, it was the right amount to keep the scent long lasting. The product itself looks beautiful as well. I will keep this company in mind when I want to gift a candle to someone. I can't wait to try the other ones!"
5,2-Jun-20,2,"UNscented The scent I purchased is called ""Joy & Laughter"". The fragrance is almost non-existent. I do like the decanter, but that's about it."
5,1-Aug-18,2,"very faint scent This candle is beautiful BUT when you let it burn you cant really smell anthing, i wanted to relax my mind so i lit it and let it burn long enough to realize there was not really a smell to it, where is the smell they talk about? Where? Very disapointed i was expecting my bedroom to fill up with this aroma , i say save your money up and buy a better qaulity candle that you can smell"
5,15-Aug-16,4,"Didn't take 24 hours to diffuse! This product says it takes 24 hours before it really starts to work...NOT IN MY HOUSE! I would say it only took about 2 hours before I could smell it throughout my house.  Now, mind you, it was very faint the further away you got from the diffuser, but I could still pick it out. The directions said to pour the whole container of oil into the diffuser and put all the reeds in...I think I am going to play around with the amount of oil in the container and reeds in the jar since I don't want to overwhelm my family with this scent."
5,18-Jul-19,5,"Great quality soy candle with wonderful scent I bought a few different scents. I hate candles were the candle melts unevenly, thus causing issues with the wick. I also hate candles where the scent is either to light or too strong. And finally, I hate candles that are great, but are gone in a short time. This was great. Lasts long, great scent, and is very nice quality."
5,24-Oct-20,5,Nice Candles are large with a strong and pleasant scent. Unfortunately 1 of the 2 that I ordered was broken.  Perhaps more or thicker bubble wrap would have protected it better. Did not want to go through the hassle of returning it since I was able to put the candle in an empty holder that I had and it works fine.
5,20-Oct-19,5,Scent that lingers for hours and beautiful aesthetic of its container! Make sure the wick is straight so it burns evenly on all sides. Other than that fantastic candle with great aesthetic. A transparent green go glow glass holder top by an insulated logo burnt wooden cap. Do not be fooled by the notes a ‚Äúwater Lilly and pear‚Äù as they are strong than one may think and will refresh a room shortly after lighting and lingers for hours.
5,8-Dec-19,5,"Great scent! Love the smell of this candle. I have orders it several times not. Not overpowering at all. So if you have a sensitivity to scent, this candle should be okay for you. I have had to return candles due to overpowering scents, but not this one. I would not recommend the largest tall size, as it gets hard to light as the candle shrinks in the glass container."
5,31-Aug-19,5,"Go-to gift item! I received this as a gift, and I have gifted it many times since!  It burns evenly and cleanly through the entire candle!  The 12.5oz size lasted me 8 months (and I burn multiple times/wk).  The scent is light and refreshing.  It fills my apartment (studio - 565sf), but doesn't smell perfumey.  Typically, candles give me a headache, but this one is perfect!"
5,1-Jul-19,5,Beauty with an Intoxicating Aroma at an Affordable Price Beautiful and pleasurable aroma...long burning and burns correctly!  One of my favorites!!!  Don‚Äôt waste money on cheap candles that lack the scent that lingers and don‚Äôt burn properly...these candles are cost efficient and give you quality for a reasonable price!  I highly recommend them and the glass is so pretty and accents any table arrangement‚ù§Ô?è
5,11-Oct-19,5,"Beautiful, smells great, great gift Beautiful glass container and the scent is great (water lily pear). The oil has lasted a long time but you do have to be diligent about flipping the reeds regularly to get a good dose of the scent in the room. Very attractive and would make a great gift."
5,6-Oct-19,5,The scent calms me This is the first scented candle that had the ability to literally calm and sooth me when anxiety sets in. I lite this candle when I‚Äôm feeling blue or just to give the air a fresh dose of serenity. It‚Äôs also great for removing food odors. Ordering more.
5,2-Sep-20,2,"Very disappointing The candle is big, don‚Äôt get me wrong...but the candle wick was completely buried under an avalanche of the candle wax. I had to dig around the wax to find the wick, and once I found the wick and lit it, it burned up super quick, making the candle unusable. Would not recommend"
5,25-Oct-19,5,"Peace & Tranquility I was skeptical when I purchased because it‚Äôs always a gamble when you don‚Äôt first smell the candle in person. I bought the duo package, gave one as a gift and kept the second one. The candle is attractive & smells wonderful. Not too strong of a scent, yet fills up the room. I highly recommend this product."
5,7-Jul-19,5,"Great clean scent! A refreshing spa-like scent. This scent is so clean and relaxing. I can smell this when I walk into my home. Perfect for summer and reminds me of the Cape Cod beaches where I grew up. Has a summery scent with hints of mint. Depending on where you sit in the room, the scent varies on the mint notes. Almost a sweet mint scent at times.  Love it."
5,17-Mar-20,5,Love+passion smells amazing great candle! Smells amazing and unlike most of the candles I‚Äôve bought this one actually scents the entire room. The scent is light not overpowering but fills the room perfectly. The candle itself is beautiful will be buying more and trying more scents!
5,20-Dec-17,5,"Nice calming scent I liked this candle so much I bought a second one as a gift. Scent is good without being""heavy"" or too perfume-y. You can tell they use quality oils as those who don't have a ""cheap"" smell when they are lit. Candle lasted for a long time, sorry didn't count the hours."
5,14-Apr-20,1,Terribly faint smell The scent I got was supposed to be a clean smell but was highly floral and just smelled like a cheap perfume.The worst part though was the range of the scent. Unless you are a foot away from this you can‚Äôt smell it at all.Don‚Äôt recommend buying this.
5,20-Sep-18,5,"Smells Amazing I bought three of these candles for gifts. Everyone of the ladies loved it. I kept hearing, smells, great, awesome and amazing. The jars are beautiful wish they were refillable. Such a shame to have to throw it away."
5,30-Jan-20,1,"No sent.  Not the Chesapeake Bay Candles that I remember. I know Chesapeake Bay was sold to another company and its apparent by the non smell of this candle.  Lit and kept in a 8x8 small room, burning for 6 hours, no smell occurred.  I bought many of the other colors, but the same goes for them - just not giving off much aroma."
5,7-Jul-20,1,Find something better elsewhere The wick might not be thick enough because it constantly burns itself out. Wax is very oily too so not sure if that is a factor. The candle is a lot smaller that I thought. I assumed coffee table size implies it‚Äôs a larger candle but it was not.
5,14-Nov-20,5,"light, delicate scent You never know what you're going to get when you buy a candle, even if it's expensive.  This one is perfect.  I can smell its scent in the house but it's not perfumy or overwhelming.  It has a light pear scent that's very pleasant."
5,4-Dec-18,1,"Arrived Broken I ordered the double gift set, and when I open the (undamaged) box, one of the candles had completely shattered, causing the other candle to be covered in glass splinters, generally causing in the end a whole wasted order. Not happy, not worth the money to send back or pursue."
5,13-Dec-19,2,"Big disappointment Can‚Äôt say anything about longevity, as it keeps going out! NO WICK above wax! Had to ‚Äúcarve out‚Äù wick and made a mess. Now wooden cover won‚Äôt close tightly. Bought four of these as gifts and wondering if friends will have same issues. Waste of $18. Don‚Äôt bother buying these. Wish I could get my money back."
5,22-Dec-18,3,"It's OK It's an OK candle. The glass is slightly frosted and pretty. It's not very strong smelling when unlit, but does well lit. It does remind me of a bathroom air freshener for some reason though. Not my favorite scent."
5,21-Jul-19,3,Fragrance doesn't go far. Couldn't really smell this candle while burning. It smells when when you get it and open to see if you like the fragrance. But after lighting it I wouldn't have known I was burning a candle if I hadn't lit it. Might be good in a very small room or bathroom.
5,8-Aug-17,5,"great candle! i got the medium size jar in the ""balance & harmony"" scent. beautiful jar and lovely,natural scent that is strong but not overpowering. and a fantastic price for this type of candle. i am now going to buy some of the other scents!"
5,7-Oct-19,4,Chesapeake Bay Wonderful Scented Candles! I love these candles they burn clean and without black soot.  Soy based is the best.  They have a long scent spread. Great essential oils used. Thank you Chesapeake Bay you did not disappoint me.  Will buy more this is my Second order!
5,5-Jan-19,1,"Just decoration Very subtle scent, so subtle it just smells like burning wax. Two stars for the attractive jar. Maybe a different scent would be better, but this one is just an expensive decoration.After using for a couple days, lowered to one star. Useless for aromatherapy."
5,16-Jan-18,5,Great candle This smells...WONDERFUL!
5,1-Jul-19,5,"One Of The Best Candles I‚Äôve Ever Bought Smells so good you‚Äôll wanna eat it! It burns well sending it‚Äôs incredible scent throughout the house. This candle lasts a long time & burns till there is nearly no wax left; gives you your moneys worth. I‚Äôve reordered 3 times now, excellent product. I‚Äôll be trying some of the brand‚Äôs other scents soon."
5,28-Aug-20,1,Nothing I put this in an itty bitty office.  After 2 days there is absolutely ZERO scent.  I can smell something very faint if I put the reeds almost up my nose.  these reed diffusers are always a hit or miss...but mostly a miss.
5,1-Apr-20,3,Aftersmell is awful The candle jar is pretty and high quality and the smell while lit is just okay. Seems to last a while. The aftersmell it leaves in the apartment is a cross between chemicals and cigarettes (I don't smoke). Would not buy again.
5,25-Feb-20,3,"it exploded I've purchased a few of these candles over the past few months and they've been great. All except this one, once it got down to the end it just cracked. I was watching TV and heard a pop and this is what it looked like. A little unnerving if you ask me."
5,4-Aug-20,3,chemical smell... so i put it in the bathroom it was very easy to set up and looks cute. i got it for my room thinking the rose water scent would be easy to work with but it smelled like chemicals or at least bathroom febreeze-like.. so i put it in the bathroom instead.
5,9-Sep-18,5,Better than expected. Well worth the buy can't wait to re-order the scent was long lasting and filled any room it was in even the largest main room of the house. Received lots of compliments my only complaint is I need a LARGER candle!
5,22-Aug-19,5,"SMELLS FOREVER & AMAZING Perfect for our ""water closet"" (think that's what it's called?? Our master bathroom has the smaller room with just a toilet) but there ofcourse are no outlets! Tried everything from gels, candles, scentsy portable, sachets... you name it I tried it. This was PERFECT! Will absolutely be buying again and again!"
5,24-Dec-19,5,"Quality This is gorgeous and the scent is energizing and passionate. This is part of a wedding gift that includes hot stones, massage oil, and snuggle blanket. I think they will love the scent and the pretty presentation jar."
5,11-Apr-19,5,The smell is so light and crisp it permeates your whole house from front to back I got this candle for my bathroom and have lit it about six times. If you leave it burning for a couple of hours the smell permeates your whole house and smells like crisp water lily and warm pears.  If you perform regular candle maintenance (trimming the wic etc.) the candle burns down beautifully. It's definitely a gift I'm going to get for family members on Mother's Day. 10/10 would buy again.
5,17-Apr-20,5,"Pretty bottle & nice scent I have to admit that I bought this because I liked the color of the container. It‚Äôs a very pretty bottle, but I love the scent, too. It is in a small bathroom, so I removed a couple of the reeds to lessen the scent. Very nice."
5,4-May-20,4,"Nice but not amazing The smell to these is not as nice as I had hoped. It is too sharp somehow. They are okay, but I won't buy this smell again. I was hoping for something light and airy but it smells too chemical-y for me - very synthetic."
5,1-Sep-20,5,"Worth it I always get my candles at TJ Maxx or Marshalls and I usually only get Yankee Candles. I'm not waiting on absurd lines and hoping there are candles on bare shelves these days. Look no further, these candles are good! They last long and smell great. They are smaller and a bit more expensive for what I usually pay, but for a quality product like this  and not having to go shopping. I'm sold."
5,25-Dec-17,5,"I can finally burn candles again! I did a lot of research in purchasing a candle bc I am very sensitive to artificial smells. Can not be around anyone wearing perfume or use scented laundry detergent, all other candles I used to love etc.. They will give me a migraine or have an asthma flare. I LOVE this candle. It's beautiful to look at and smells wonderful. The first time I burned it I was disappointed bc I couldn't smell anything at all. But I gave it a second chance and boy am I glad I did! It has a wonderful smell that will not knock you down but fills 3 adjoining rooms perfectly. I purchased the Simplicity and Hope. Will be trying other scents soon! So nice to be able to burn a candle after all these yrs!"
5,2-Oct-20,1,"Smells like nothing! The candle has no smell, it‚Äôs so weak that it‚Äôs disappointing..... will not buy again!"
5,7-Dec-18,3,"If you like the smell of shampoo... Candle looks good. The semi-transparent blue container and wood lid are the real reason I bought the candle the smell was secondary, but with water Lilly pear you couldn‚Äôt go wrong. Once I got it I lit it and low and behold after about 10 minutes my room smells like someone just got out of the shower and shampooed their hair, so good for cleansing the room of a smell but not really something I‚Äôd like to smell from a candle."
5,23-Dec-19,5,"These smell GREAT! I just love these...I've been buying them for several years.  They are classy, and a pleasant scent.  The frosted glass container is nice, and the real wood top is very earthy.  They also make a great gift."
5,26-Jan-19,5,"so refreshing this is a really wonderful year-round scent-- refreshing in the summertime, wonderfully clean cozy in winter! I'm still SO salty that target discontinued the simplicity and hope scent, so I'm really glad I can find it here for much cheaper! I bought a set of two and I'll definitely be purchasing more. The candle burns really evenly so I don't feel like there's wasted wax, and lasts a long time."
5,19-Apr-20,2,"Nope They‚Äôre pretty but they don‚Äôt smell like anything. I got two different ones... the white one and the harmony and balance. The later of the 2 smells a tad better but still, it‚Äôs been burning all night and I can‚Äôt even smell it when I walk into the room. Bath and body works, yankee candles, and scentsy are much much better."
5,28-Feb-19,5,"Really enjoy the scent I own a salon and use essential oils in diffusers.  I like this candle because is uses essential oils and really has a clean, and pleasant scent.  Most of all I like that my clients are not breathing in chemicals like they would if I were to use fragrance candles.  Plan to buy more.  And the candle lasts a long time too."
5,26-Mar-20,3,"I‚Äôll keep looking... Nice candle, not getting much scent from it.I got the ‚Äúpeace and tranquility‚Äù (cashmere and jasmine)Does not scent the room like I had hoped.I like that it‚Äôs soy.  And it does burn evenly."
5,30-Sep-19,5,"My Husband loves this My husband loves this scent, because it reminds him of his grandfather's pipe. I will say - it does smell like tobacco. So maybe don't light this right before you have sensitive guests over. But the smell doesn't linger too long, so it wont make your house smell forever."
5,3-Nov-20,4,"Smells really good and long-lasting, in a pretty container Smells really good, it's been several months since I've bought it and still going strong. Looks pretty on the shelf. The smell can be kind of strong sometimes but usually it's okay, and not chemically."
5,16-Jul-18,5,Five Stars smells clean and fresh. not over bearing.
5,8-Jan-20,5,"Very Pleasant Scent Chesapeake Bay Candle Reed Diffuser, Awaken + Invigorate (Lemongrass Eucalyptus) gives off a very pleasant scent.  It is a lighter scent as opposed to some others which just overpower everything.  Comes in a very nice package and I consider it a very nice gift to give someone."
5,16-May-20,4,"Lovely candle, just not my fav This is very pretty and burns a long time. However, the smell is just...ugh. Very strong and I generally put it up high in hopes of making it more subtle to our noses. Just not the fragrance for me."
5,1-Jun-19,1,Not worth it Reeds look like they are not effective or fake.  The liquid does not scent a small room and the liquid level does not move because it doesn't work .  The last one that worked was from somewhere else and was close to $40.  Investing in atomization machine instead.
5,16-May-18,4,Refreshing and clean It smells like clean laundry. I can't wait to burn it.
5,22-Nov-19,1,It tunnels in 1 inch diameter Disappointed in this product. Lovely smell but after burning for two hours it is tunneling in a one inch area leaving most of it untouched. I bought the medium candle. Can not recommend this product.
5,5-Jan-19,5,"Awesome I just got this candle.  I bought the cashmere and jasmine one. Omg the smell is so soft, like Heaven in a candle.  It‚Äôs a large pillar so I expect it will last.  Definitely worth the money spent and I will order more.  Arrived quickly and packaged well."
5,9-Jul-19,5,Simple great smelling candle This is a perfect gitable item. I bought it for my friend for Christmas. This winter was so brutal and I was looking for items that would make her home more cozy; since all we could do is stay inside. It smells great and it burns well. Great product for the price.
5,24-Feb-20,5,"Delicious smelling candle I initially bought this as a gift for my sister and I loved the scent so much that I bought one for myself! It smells soooo good. The scent wafts throughout the entire room and the candle burns evenly. And for the price, I highly recommend this candle!"
5,4-Jul-20,1,"Save your money The only way I can smell it is if I get close to it. I placed it in the guest bathroom, small enough to smell in there. Burns slow but what‚Äôs the use of it can barely be smelled? Would not purchase again."
5,5-Oct-19,3,Pretty candle Love the green glass it comes in. Lit both up today. Smell just wasn't my forte.  Very light smell. Thought maybe burning them would make the smell a little stronger but nope. Longevity I cannot answer.
5,9-May-20,5,"nice competition for the more expensive brands. I have bought 2 of the higher end diffusers and this one is right up there with them. Clear  and easily opened.This fragrance is fresh and clean.Not powdery or floral. so far, so good"
5,13-Dec-18,5,"This is something new I enjoy candles and such, but there's something really tranquil and designed well. Its like holding smooth seaglass, very comforting and smooth for a candle.  The scent sneaks up on you like a warm blanket.Wish I bought two, its very well built."
5,20-Jun-18,5,I like everything about it I like everything about it.  Some people say the smell is too strong while others say too weak...to each their own...I'm not a professional candle sniffer. All I know is its pretty and smells delightful to me.
5,3-Sep-19,2,"No scent I love candles. I put this one on my nightstand and I don't smell anything.  You get a hint of the scent when you light it and when you blow it out, nothing while it burns. I have bought $3 candles that smell up the entire house. I won't buy another one."
5,28-Feb-20,2,"No scent This candle had no scent.  I could have went to the dollar store and bought.  The presentation is nice it's pretty but I wanted a scented candle.  Returned.  Maybe it was old idk, was disappointed."
5,30-Dec-19,5,Love the scent! I have bought 5 of these candles. I love the calming scent. I feel like a lot of candles I buy have an overpowering scent then last only a few burns. These offer just the right fragrance and last me a month of constant burning. Fresh clean smell. Great gift for anyone.
5,6-Mar-19,3,"Not a Lot of Harmony and Balance This candle is wrapped in a beautifully light colored glass. It has a nice fragrance (before lighting).  Burns well without soot. Once the candle begins burning, the scent smells more like burning plain wax rather than water lily pear. There's a hint of the water lily in the air but not much. Maybe this is an old candle‚ò?‚ò?‚ò?"
5,25-Aug-19,1,No smell peace and tranquility Peace and tranquillity has no smell at all.  I am disappointed as I was looking forward to a nice smelling room tonight.
5,6-Jan-19,1,Does not meet expectations I was really looking forward to to enjoying this product unfortunately it fell very short of expectations. We could not smell any scent unless our noses were hovering over this candle. I wouldn't recommend this product.
5,28-Apr-19,5,"LOVE THE NEW YANKEE CANDLE STYLE AND SCENT.  FAN FOR LIFE! I absolutely love this new line of candles, this id currently my favorite candle in the Yankee Candle family.  The scent is so delicious it actually smells like a fresh pears. Another winner from the best candle company in the world!"
5,16-Apr-19,2,"For a Mouse's Nose This candle's scent is so subtle you have to keep it in a tiny room for it to have any effect at all. I have dubbed it a ""bathroom candle,"" for when you're taking a bath and want that pleasant ambiance. Don't rely on it to clear up any bad smells BY ANY MEANS! It also will not fill the home with a pleasant aroma, though the (extremely vague) scent is fine. I don't recommend this brand and would not purchase again."
5,11-Oct-20,5,"Nice, subtle scent Nice, subtle scent. I was worried it would be too strong but I really just catch little whiffs when I‚Äôm entering my bedroom (the diffuser is in the bathroom in my bedroom.) Smells clean."
5,4-Jul-19,4,Smells strong I purchased the refresh + rejuvenate for in my bathroom. The smell is strong and will travel to others rooms easily. I am not sure I like the Mediterranean citrus they were going for though. I also feel like it burns through really fast.I will try others scents maybe....
5,10-May-18,5,Five Stars Love the seaside sort of scent it has to it. Can't wait to use it.
5,15-May-19,5,Worth the buy! Love this scent as well as how much it fills the room. I have a master bedroom 14' by 16' and a bathroom connected. Fills both rooms while I leave the bathroom door open during the day. You can even smell it in the hallway leading to my bedroom. Definitely worth it!
5,3-Jun-19,2,"Disappointed Likes:Container is very pretty. Packaging is excellent, burns evenly. Dislike which is the reason I purchased...faint, undetectable scent. I cannot smell it;hence, 2 stars for packaging, appearance and even burning , no stars for scent."
5,20-Mar-20,3,"Nice, but more floral. Nice candle but not the scent I wanted.....was looking for more of a fruit smell..... pineapple/coconut.  This seems more floral instead of fruit.  Nice....just not what I hoped for."
5,9-Jul-18,5,Beautiful and extremely aromatic These candles are long lasting and supremely aromatic throughout the entire burn of the wick. I especially like the simplistic branding on the frosted glass so it can be decorative without being too loud in design.
5,29-Apr-18,5,sniff me and you'll love me great scent and good burn.  excellent product.
5,23-May-17,5,i bought the scents joy and laughter and balance and harmony and they both ... i bought the scents joy and laughter and balance and harmony and they both smell amazing. joy reminds me of fruity pebbles. the scent is very strong and you can smell it from a couple rooms away. the jar is also very nice and chic looking
5,30-Jul-19,1,Candle arrived in broken pieces!!!! My item arrived broken in pieces!!!! It was just thrown in the box.  I‚Äôm furious- it was very dangerous opening a box with broken glass and I was looking forward to this candle that I now cannot use!
5,7-Feb-18,5,Great candle!! Nice size and smells amazing.  I‚Äôve been using the candle since Christmas and it‚Äôs still going strong.
5,11-Aug-18,5,Great scent i was excited when this was a lightning deal because I saw them at yankee candle a few months ago. I love this scent and love these candles. I would buy again at full price
5,4-Jan-19,5,"A Lovely Backround Scent I like to think of this candle like the olfactory equivalent of those ten-hour lo-fi jazz playlists on Spotify. Catchy, not too crazy, and certainly not boring. It's... livable. Comfortable. Subtle. Really quite enjoyable. Focus & Patience is my go-to for long work sessions where I want to feel cozy."
5,9-Apr-18,5,I am very pleased with this Gifted this to a coworker and it never left the office. They lit it and left it lit until the candle was finished and then they were asking for more. I am very pleased with this purchase
5,24-May-20,5,"Great gift idea This candle brand is by far my favorite! It‚Äôs a light sent that freshens your house, and doesn‚Äôt give a heavy smokey smell when you blow it out. I‚Äôve given this candle many times as a gift, too."
5,6-Dec-19,5,A new favorite candle I will always have on hand now Got this to give as a present but I just ordered another one for myself immediately! This has the nicest clean scent. It‚Äôs not knock you down powerful but you don‚Äôt have to get right up on it to smell it either. It‚Äôs fantastic and the scent fragrances the room beautifully.
5,10-Sep-20,3,"Received item not as described. I ordered this, in this particular scent.  Received an entirely different scent.  And, candle is not as pictured.  It's very small:  width and height not as pictured.  Disappointed."
5,1-May-19,5,Simply Incredible This candle provides a lovely scent that lasts as long as the candle is burning. Additionally it has a decently long life if you are someone who likes to burn candles every day.
5,30-Jan-19,5,"My preferred brand, value for the money. This brand always burns all the wax and for the length of time for the amount of wax as expected. The smell is strong enough to cover my workshop smells like strong grease and adhesive smells. Really helps me stay focused too."
5,30-Aug-20,1,"FAKE CHESAPEAKE BAY CANDLE DON'T BUY Don't order this from here better idea to buy in store..this candles wick wasn't placed right and burned out after only 10 mins of use and wick is completely unusable now NEVER had a problem when I bought at Target, Meijers and Kohl's"
5,19-Mar-19,1,Not good I bought 2 candles and they have been burning for over an hour and I can barely smell them and what I do smell I don‚Äôt like lol so bummed!  This is the last time I buy a candle online without smelling it first.  My bad.
5,22-May-19,5,Smells so good! Smells great!  Whole house smells great!  Lit for hours and there‚Äôs barely a dent in it.  Will be ordering more.  Also nice looking candle and would make a great gift.
5,22-Jul-20,1,"Doesn't smell like rose at all This product is a huge disappointment. I was expecting a rose floral scent, and it actually smells like musty mothballs and is not at all floral. Terrible. If you expect a fresh rose scent, do NOT purchase this product. It's too bad I already opened it. Otherwise, would return it for sure."
5,25-Jun-20,5,Candle Excellent in my bathroom. Love the scent.
5,21-Feb-18,5,"Subtle yet relaxing! Subtle yet relaxing scent, great for the bedroom to put the mind at ease before falling asleep.  I would recommend you blow it out before you fall asleep, though!"
5,24-Jan-19,1,DONT BUY THIS! I would give this zero stars if I could. GLASS SHATTERED EVERYWHERE!!! DO NOT BURN TOO LONG/ TO THE END IF YOU DO BUY. Burns very quickly so doesn‚Äôt last long. I bought because this one was on sale. I definitely would never buy full price and now knowing how dangerous this candle is I will never buy again.
5,26-Dec-19,5,"Works really well After reading the reviews, I expected this to work nicely. What I didn't expect was that it would work so well, or so quickly! I highly recommend this reed diffuser!! I'm even considering buying a second one for another part of the house."
5,2-Nov-17,5,"Five Stars Great candle for the price. Burns evenly, and smells terrific!"
5,13-Aug-18,5,"Love The Fragrance The containers were packaged very well, glass jar-type candle holders were wrapped in lots of bubble wrap. No damage during shipping. The medium size is perfect for a table on our screened-in porch, and the fragrance is mild and very soothing. I hope they don't discontinue the Mind & Body Scented, Confidence + Freedom."
5,24-Nov-20,5,A Favorite! I absolutely love this candle! It can definitely spread through a large living room and burns so evenly it's amazing! I will be stocking up on these. Such a great find!
5,7-Mar-19,2,Old Lady Smell This smells like an old woman. I kept getting a whiff of 90s school secretary/funeral home and finally realized this was it. My roommates were shocked at the smell when they came home as well. It's like a very heavy floral perfume that you really smell once you've walked away and come back. It's not good.
5,14-Apr-20,5,"Smells great, lasts a long time I purchased this candle on a whim but I was not at all disappointed. The scent was clean and fresh. It burned beautifully and lasted a long time. I fully intend to buy several more in different scents to find my favorite!"
5,12-Jan-18,5,Five Stars One of my favorite candles. You can smell it both lit and unlit.
5,11-May-20,4,"Wick off center This was a gift from grandkids to mom on Mother's Day. Disappointed that the wick was off center. It's not like it's a dollar store candle! Otherwise, jar and cover are attractive."
5,24-Feb-19,5,Smells great. Fills house fast! I've paid top dollar for candles from other vendors and I can't smell them from three feet away. Within five minutes the scent from this one filled my entire room. Shortly thereafter my entire house. Smells like fresh clean soap. I'll definitely buy again and try out the other scents.
5,24-Sep-19,5,"Great purchase, but the glass was delivered in pieces. I do love the scent.  This is the second time I‚Äôve purchased this same item. This time when I opened the box, the glass was broken. I am keeping the rest of the product, but had to throw away the glass. I just wanted you to be aware."
5,11-Jul-19,5,"Smells Wonderful! I'm fairly picky about candle scents so I was taking a gamble purchasing one online, but the reviews looked great - and they were true! I got Peace + Tranquility and it's a beautiful scent!"
5,6-Jun-19,5,"Obsessed!!! I LOVE this candle and wish my whole life smelled like it. I always buy one when they're on sale in the store, but this was a few dollars less than in a store. Yankee Candles, if you're reading this, please make this scent available for ever and in different forms that just candles."
5,21-Sep-17,5,"A gift to keep giving I found it!  ""A great birthday gift for an adult who has everything."" Also, there is enough variety to keep giving for now and future birthdays/Christmases."
5,13-Oct-20,5,Love these Love these!! Normally buy yankee candle. These are just as good . Smell great burn well. Tunnel a bit in middle at first but if you burn a little longer evens out definitely recommend
5,15-May-18,5,"Lovely scent! I absolutely love the smell of this candle. It's not too strongly scented, but perfect. It burns nice and even, and fairly slowly. I'd recommend it to anyone who loves candles."
5,24-Feb-19,1,"Good size,burns well I detect no order at all and my sense of smell is working fine. Would not buy this or any other candle from these people again. Have purchased candles in the drug store and grocery store that are far better then this one."
5,4-Jan-20,5,I love this scent! This is the second time I have ordered this candle. This time I opted to get the larger one and it is definitely worth it. It smells so good! Would also consider this as a gift to my friends. Would buy again.
5,20-Feb-20,5,Smells nice We are candle people!This seems to be our go to nowSome are too strong/ this is perfect
5,30-Sep-19,5,"Best Candle ever! Beautiful jar, creamy wax that burns slowly, evenly.  Came extremely well packaged for shipping...no worries.  The scent builds and is lovely, not overpowering.  I'm buying more!"
5,18-Oct-19,5,Mother of all Candles This is by far the best candle I have purchased. I love the lemongrass eucalyptus scent.  I originally purchased it to repel mosquitoes and then read that it has so many other benefits.  The smell is fresh and invigorating.  I have already purchased two and will purchase more in the future!
5,4-Jul-20,5,Treat Yourself I have bought several of these different scents & they are all amazing & smell wonderful!! I highly recommend each of scents as they are relaxing & fantastic to the senses!!
5,12-Mar-20,5,Fantastic Scent and longevity I was skeptical about the scents but they are lovely.  The sea salt and sage does not smell like sage at all but still a nice smell.  The candles burn slow which I love because I usually go through candles quickly
5,29-Oct-20,1,"Rose Water = Gheri Curl Do not buy the Serenity + Purity (Rose water) candle. It smells like gheri curl activator hair products, no lie. I couldn‚Äôt return it fast enough."
5,31-Dec-18,3,"Just Okay They look really nice as a decorative piece and smell is pleasant, although, the scent isn't strong enough to really make a difference in the house. I've only lit these a couple hours a night for a few nights, and its half way gone, so the 50 hour burn estimate is definitely off. Wouldn't purchase again."
5,15-Dec-18,4,Light scent but I enjoy it If you're looking for a candle with a super strong scent then this is not it. It has a very light scent which is perfectly fine for me. I have 2 dogs and a cat and it masks the animal smell without being overbearing.
5,14-Oct-20,5,Happy customer The aroma is wonderful but the candle jar itself is absolutely gorgeous.  The fragrance spreads all around the first floor. I love this one
5,16-Jan-20,5,Great scented candles My mother loves scented candles and out of all the candles she has these candles have the best scent that actually fills the room.  Can‚Äôt go wrong with this product
5,22-Nov-18,5,Well worth the price! I love this company but this reed diffuser was better than I expected. The scent smells awesome and the oil is not as greasy and it doesn't stain my furniture if any of it gets on it. Great product I highly recommend
5,31-Mar-19,5,Really great candles All the Chesapeake Bay Candles I've seen have been very good quality with excellent scents. They're pricey for candles but they are some of the best candles I've seen.
5,12-Aug-20,5,Nice Scent These candles were well packaged good job on that. These candles are so pretty. Nice blue color. It has a lovely scent not overpowering.
5,21-Aug-20,5,Love the scent. This was the first Chesapeake candle I purchased and I love it !. I tried another scent which was too strong and ended up finding a friend to give it to and she has purchased another one through Amazon.The candle Tranquilly is a soft sweet scent that my husband an I enjoy very much.
5,26-Jun-18,5,"Favorite Candle in the World! Absolutely the best candle in the world. The smell is fresh and floral. Great quality, does not tunnel, enjoy every inch of this candle."
5,10-Dec-18,3,"I give it a 3 star because they are too expensive. They smell very nice and definitely smell nice while burning. However, they leave a black soot on the nice clear glass so they don't look pretty anymore and there are candles out there that smell nice but a better buy for your money."
5,21-Mar-20,4,Nice candle I like the scent but something about it smells a tad strong/overbearing at times. It is pleasant and calming tho so I would buy it again.
5,15-Dec-19,5,"Joy + Laughter I LOVE this Joy + Laughter candle by Chesapeake Bay. My favorite part is the name of it, but the scent is pretty awesome, too. The best thing is that my son even lights it without any prodding from me!"
5,2-Dec-19,5,"The large one is perfect size. I used it for the beautiful smell. Simply beautiful candle, I highly recommend this product. The products came a day early thank you driver."
5,6-Feb-19,5,"House warming gift Got this as a house warming gift for my sister who is seeking ""clarity & balance."" I didn't light it, but did smell the wax and it was very nice, mild and comforting. My sister says she loves it!"
5,23-Jul-19,1,"RIPOFF These candles are not worth what you pay for them, they  are so tiny and have hardly any fragrance unless you close the door you are burning them in, not worth 25 bucks for sure."
5,17-Dec-18,5,You get value for your money! This diffuser smell so so good. I'll definitely buy another one. I put it in my bathroom and I tell you it's great smelling. You can even smell out of the bathroom. I don't regret buying this product. I wish they sold the refill oil tho.
5,3-Jun-19,5,"Great candles!!! These candles are great!!! Smell is very relaxing, and it makes the room smell amazing without overpowering your lungs. I use them a lot and leave them burning a while, and I‚Äôm still only half way through 2 candles. Love love LOVE and will be purchasing more for me, family & friends."
5,5-Oct-20,1,"Steer clear of the ""Large"" size - all other sizes are wonderful. The wick got buried in the wax within hours of the first burn, rendering it useless. Waste of money."
5,9-Apr-20,5,"Amazing scent!!! Great candle!!!  Beautiful presentation.  Makes excellent gift to yourself or others.  I wish it were a little more affordable, and lasted longer."
5,11-Apr-20,2,No scent after 4-5 hrs burning The candle has been burning for 4-5 hrs now and I‚Äôm yet to smell the scent. It looked good with a wooden cap and nice label but no scent! Not happy at all.
5,21-Apr-18,4,Four Stars smells good and lasts a long time
5,14-Mar-20,2,"Weak Scent Pleasant soft calming scent, but it barely smells. You can smell it if you put it three inches from your nose. So not very practical unless you‚Äôre trying to burn your nose."
5,26-Feb-20,1,"Balance & Harmony (water lily pear) Seriously, smells like regular Tide laundry soap powder.  No more scented candles on line.  Glad to get this out of my house."
5,24-Oct-20,4,Quality The scent is light and soothing. Not too strong. Only thing is the wick burns so far the candle wax barely burns. Small flames
5,11-Jan-19,5,"Mmmm smells great! This candle smells so good... and I haven't smelled it while it's actually burning. I bought it as a Christmas gift for my daughter-in-law, but it smells so good, I might have to get one for myself."
5,8-Mar-20,3,smells great I love the scent of this candle and the three wicksUnfortunately as it burned the glass broke! I almost cut myself and it leaked wax on to my table
5,25-Jul-18,5,"this fragrance is simply beautiful.. Being the candle lover that I am this fragrance is simply beautiful.. Being the candle lover that I am, I totally advise you to try these...they are made in the USA too.. lovely, just lovely!!!"
5,4-Jul-19,5,"Nice set, looks great as decor piece I love this brand and scent.The wooden lid means you can leave out as decor piece and dust wont get on wax in candle."
5,25-May-19,5,"Smells good - lemongrass eucalyptus is the bomb!!! beautiful soft scent - love the smell, freshens up my room - the scent is so calming and travels across my rooms. the color is soothing green and the oils smells good - wish i could find the refill as i am going to run out of it soon! :)"
5,23-Aug-20,5,"LOVE THIS SCENT!  Long lasting also! This scent is AMAZING!!!  Love, love, love it!!  I have one in my half bath and one in my bedroom closet!  Will definitely repurchase this again!!  Wonderful Scent!!!"
5,27-May-19,5,"Makes your home smell like Heaven I first bought the Reflection & Clarity candle and the beach-like scent was incredible, so I got a diffuser in that scent for a 24/7 heavenly scent. Love it."
5,2-Jun-20,2,Scent too sweet Scent is too sweet. I prefer clean scents. I used less reed diffusers to see if it would help but the sweetness of this scent was overpowering.
5,20-Sep-20,5,beautiful These are a gift and are absolutely beautiful. The scent is wonderful and relaxing.  i know my friends will love them.
5,23-Sep-20,5,Love this candle smell and design! Great smell and very refreshing. I like the design of the glass container and the cap as well. Overall the smell is great and the candle quality is top notch!
5,14-Apr-20,1,No scent/used candle/ someone poured plain wax & junky wick into used Chesapeake Bay candle jar. This Candle looks & smells used. It smells like nothing as if somebody took an empty Chesapeake bay Candle jar and just filled up with unscented wax & a junky wick.
5,5-Feb-20,5,Nice Candle Gave this candle as a gift. Love the smell and look of the candle.
5,13-May-18,5,Five Stars Best smell ever !!! Buying again & again
5,13-Nov-20,5,Nice scent that creates a relaxing atmosphere I was pleasantly surprised by this candle. I bought it on a whim and have really enjoyed it. I would buy it again!
5,17-Sep-19,5,Smells Amazing The coffee table candle is perfect for filling a large room with a great aroma. Love it as well as the cranberry scent.
5,11-Apr-20,2,"2/5 At Best The scent, after about 5-10 minutes, is unbearable. It makes you long for fresh air. The candle is cool otherwise."
5,2-May-18,5,"I love it! A hint of wonserful, relaxing scent without being overpowering. I love it!"
5,26-Feb-18,5,Five Stars This Candle burns for two or three hours and it still near the top wow will buy it again.
5,7-Sep-19,5,"Loved it. Lovely scent, slow burning and it would fill out entire living room with beautiful aroma. highly recommend as a gift"
5,19-Apr-19,5,Absolutely lovely Love these candles! The scent permeates my whole apartment and is lovely. I've bought a second set and will reorder once they have been used up. Definitely recommend.
5,3-May-19,1,"Weak I love candles and buy them all the time. But this apparently is not my brand. The scent, though nice, can't be noticed unless the candle is right next to you."
5,21-Mar-20,1,"Fake? I am really under the impression that these are not really from Chesapeake Bay, but fakes. Quality is poor and when I opened the top of the candle their were wax pieces everywhere."
5,12-Oct-19,5,"Worth the money‚ô° Strongly scented, burned evenly and steadily. Beautiful glow from colored glass as well. Top is quality and seals well when closed."
5,30-May-20,5,Love these candles! I really like the smell of this candle Love + Passion. It‚Äôs not too strong and doesn‚Äôt have a perfume scent like the cashmere one.
5,20-Feb-19,5,My favorite I really enjoy the smell of this.  It‚Äôs not too powerful and I can burn it for about half hour and the smell lasts for awhile.  I will buy this again when this candle is done.
5,17-Apr-19,5,Nicely scented candles for when you want to relax These two were gifts for a coworker and she loved the scents. Not too strong nor too light. The lid is a nice touch as well.
5,8-Feb-20,5,Great candle for great price I'm impressed with the candle. Even burning and the scent continues throughout. Definitely will be purchasing again.
5,8-Jan-20,5,"Birthday Present Great candle at a reasonable price, this was a gift so I did not actually smell the candle but my brother was very pleased with his gift"
5,23-May-20,2,"Not the best Such high hopes for this candle because this is my favorite scent, but I can barely smell it even when I get close. Won‚Äôt order it again."
5,1-Feb-20,5,5 stars Purchased this for a friend and they said it smells wonderful! Will be buying one for myself isn‚Äôt he future.
5,21-Jun-19,3,"not so happy with it I've only used it a short time, but it doesn't seem as though it will burn to the end, scent is very mild."
5,13-Feb-19,5,"Perfect I love these candles.  I have gotten a few of them.  Some for me, and some for gifts.  They are always received well and smell so nice in the house as I burn my own."
5,17-Apr-19,5,Love! This is a very good candle! It smells amazing and permeates the room nicely. I just love it-in fact I recently just bought two more! Yeah for me :)
5,7-May-19,5,Great Candle This candle was more than I expected. Its lasted so long. The smell is amazing and the smell still is in the air of the room for HOURS after I blow it out. I LOVE it and will be buying more of these.
5,25-May-20,4,Powerful aroma Powerful aroma! It‚Äôs great but in small doses. Lit for too long gives me a headache. It does the job keeping my home smelling wonderful
5,1-May-20,5,"Lovely Smells delicious! It doesn‚Äôt last all that long, but was delightful while it did. Would purchase again!"
5,20-Jul-19,5,Lovely These candles smelled amazing! I wish they weren‚Äôt gifts so I could keep them for myself. I‚Äôm certain that my coworkers enjoyed these. This is my favorite brand for candles
5,6-Jul-18,5,"Nice candles They looked larger in the pictures when I ordered them, so they're a little pricey for their size, but they smell and look great.For some reason one came without a lid :/"
5,11-May-19,2,treatable smell for me The Pineapple Coconut scent was a treatable smell for me. I wish there was a way to sample these things. I will not buy scents online anymore.
5,15-Jan-20,4,Its a nice smelling candle Its a nice smelling candle. The scent is a little strong so I only turn it on a few minutes at a time.
5,15-Apr-18,1,"No scent, not worth the money This candle had a nice but light scent before lighting.  No scent when lit and after a few weeks all it does is give off light."
5,19-Oct-18,5,"Best-Smelling Candle Ever!!! This exact candle was gifted to me, and I liked it so much I bought the candle again! Best candle I‚Äôve ever smelled. Love it!"
5,8-Jun-20,3,"Left me wanting. The smell is pleasant, but it will only populate a small room, like a bathroom.  Scent is unnoticeable in a larger room."
5,18-Aug-19,5,Smells nice Smells nice and burns slowly. I burn for hours and still have a lot left. I loved this brand so much I bought more.
5,4-Mar-19,5,"Nice and light I bought the water lily pear.  Smells so good.  It‚Äôs nice and light, not over powering at all.  I live in a smaller one bedroom apt and it smells up the whole place."
5,11-Dec-19,2,Smelling good but product leaked This review is for the diffuser. It seemed to have leaked a bit in transport. Packaging was oily and the bottle was t completely full. A little disappointed.
5,28-Aug-20,5,Nice! I love this candle! Nice scent! It also lasts much longer than the little Glade candles I ordered.
5,30-Mar-19,3,"VERY subtle scent. Maybe too subtle. Honestly, I was a little disappointed. I know some of the reviews said the scent was subtle, I didn't realize they meant THAT subtle. I could barely smell anything."
5,29-Jan-18,4,Very nice look and smell Very nice look and smell.  They burn a bit messy but since the jar is tall there is no issue.  Highly recommend the product.
5,13-May-18,5,So pleasant. Received one for Christmas from a friend. A gentle smel and lasts quite a long time.  I'm ordering again.
5,30-Dec-19,4,Smells great! It smells good. Not overbearing. Refreshing! I‚Äôd definitely buy it again. The only pitfall I bought two and one of them arrived in pieces and it‚Äôs glass. Burns for hours.
5,2-Jan-20,5,Candle lk e I am a candle lover and this scent is both calming and slightly sweet. It's one of my new favorites.
5,18-Jul-19,5,Lavender smells amazing Love the scent. So far it burns well too. They sell this at Target but I found it a little cheaper on amazon.
5,23-May-20,2,"Average candle can't ever compliment anything,  either price goes way up or item no longer available. THIS candle is average and not worth waiting 2 months for"
5,8-Jan-19,5,"Perfect for a gift Calming, relaxing and affordable. I have this to my sister as a gift. She‚Äôs in college and needed the relaxing scent of the candle!"
5,15-Jan-19,5,"Great soy candles!  Soy is much better than paraffin!!! Soybean candles are the way to go these days. Even Yankee Candle Company still uses paraffin which dirties the walls,ceilings and wallpaper. These are great!"
5,9-Apr-19,4,"I need to buy it one more time to decide. I have purchased stronger scented EO candles else where, but this was okay.I will update after the second candle"
5,17-Apr-20,4,My favourite candle Received my first one as a gift and got addicted to the scent. It just does not last very long.
5,14-May-20,5,Nice gift Got this as a gift for my daughter in law. I was concerned the scent might be too much but she loved it.
5,21-Oct-20,5,Beautiful fragrance I have never burned a candle so quickly! Lightly sweet (not overwhelming) and soothing. Ordering again!
5,10-Oct-18,5,"Excellent, clean scent I love a good candle and this one does not disappointing. It is both long lasting and pleasing without being overbearing at all. I'd say its a fresh scent with a hint of sweetness."
5,22-Aug-20,1,Not worth it. I was so exited about this candle. Not worth it. It doesn‚Äôt even smell. Waste of money. Sorry.
5,27-Oct-20,1,No scent at all Not sure why the candle got high rating...I don‚Äôt smell anything at all. Total waste of money.
5,20-Sep-20,1,Waste of money Absolutely no noticeable scent from the diffuser in a 200 sq ft room. Complete waste of money.
5,7-Nov-19,4,It's lasting well and looks very nice! The scent was fairly week on this particular candle.  It's lasting well and looks very nice!
5,28-Jan-20,5,Heavenly! Look no further! The scent of water lily and pear was extremely refreshing and renewing. These Chesapeake Bay candles are fantastic. I've bought hundreds of candles and from now on I believe I will only order from this line. I have 8 candles in my cart awaiting payday.
5,5-Mar-20,5,"Very nice Got this for a friend for Christmas. She really liked it. Looks high quality, pretty color, smells nice."
5,13-Apr-19,2,"Very light scent... I put all the reeds in, put it in a small, enclosed space and waited two days. Very light scent so I waited another couple of days. Still a very-very light scent. First time using this kind of air freshener and I‚Äôm not impressed."
5,19-Jan-20,1,Candle does not burn Poor quality wick. It is impossible to get this candle to burn. I've missed the return window. I've not had problems with other candles purchased through Amazon.  I would not recommend this product.
5,4-Jan-20,5,"SCENTED CANDLE THIS CANDLE IS THE BEST THAT  I HAVE EVER USED, THE SENT FILLS YOUR SPACE,  IT'S SO NICE, A RELAXING, FEEL IT'S JUST THE BEST!!! SIMPLE, BUY IT!"
5,20-Oct-20,5,Beautiful! The scent is beautiful and will be the perfect gift for a friend‚Äôs newly decorated bedroom.
5,9-Jan-19,5,Amazing candle This candle is absolutely amazing. I didn‚Äôt know what to expect but the smell is awesome. I need to get more and the price was perfect.
5,27-Aug-17,5,"LOVE  IT, THANK YOU EXCELLENT OF COURSE......VERY MELLOW & SOFT"
5,18-Feb-20,5,Fantastic! This candle smells absolutely heavenly. I'm completely satisfied and plan to buy more soon.
5,14-Jan-20,5,Scent does not fade away The best candle I have ever bought. I just purchased another one because they are that good.
5,18-Sep-19,3,Faint Scent Smells good if you put your nose above the candle but really doesn't fill the room with a nice fragrance by any means.  Looks nice.  Seems to be lasting a long time.
5,2-Nov-19,4,Nice gift The blue candle scent was a little too masculine for my taste since I was gifting it to a woman for self care. Overall- good product.
5,3-Apr-20,1,Minimal scent I ordered the golden ‚ÄúStrength and Energy‚Äù. Save your money. Minimal scent. I can only smell it if I‚Äôm right by the candle. Disappointed.
5,30-Jan-18,5,Now that I live on the bay I wanted something ... Now that I live on the bay I wanted something close to home.  These candles have lasted forever and have a scent that is fresh without being overpowering.
5,29-Mar-17,5,"Awesome scent! Really love the look of this candle!  The gorgeous, frosted glass with a wooden top really make it stand out amongst my other candles.  I ordered the 'strength and energy' scent and have received numerous compliments from guests regarding the smell.  Though my home is not super large, I have found that the scent really fills up the space nicely."
5,26-May-19,5,"2for 1 Fabulous smells great. And when candle is done. Which is long lasting. You clean the jar out. Put cotton balls Qtips, bobby-pins comes with a nice wooden top.  Recycle"
5,1-Oct-19,1,"Poison. Nowhere in the description on Amazon does it mention formaldehyde. Absolutely disgusting, doesn't burn clean, smells like chemicals, nothing good about this candle."
5,11-Jul-19,5,"such a lovely candle This candle is just beautiful! The jar it comes in is pretty, the scent is lovely without being overpowering."
5,23-Dec-18,3,"Good candles no complaints Candles have a very sleek and elegant look to them. The scent is ok, but that‚Äôs because I usually like stronger scents when I light my candles."
5,24-Jun-20,5,"Love it Simply the best smelling candle, with the perfect light blue color, lasts long, and gives off great vibes."
5,13-Jan-20,5,Wonderful I am sensitive to smells and this candle has an amazing soft scent jazz. I got this as a gift and used it so much I bought myself one. It is awesome!
5,1-Apr-19,1,Meh I wouldn‚Äôt buy it again I like the candle holder itself however can‚Äôt say anything good about the scent....which there isn‚Äôt any. It‚Äôs just a candle. Very disappointing.
5,8-Dec-19,5,Amazing! Best smelling candle on the planet. Gorgeous presentation. Definitely a great product!
5,25-Jun-19,2,the lid does not fit very loose I am not sure if we just have a bad one but the wooden lid does not fit.  it is VERY loose and has tipped over and all oil spilled out.  Maybe if we had a different lid it might be better.  Seems it should fit a bit more snug. It is very pretty but we are worried about it spilling again.
5,28-Mar-20,3,item was damaged from seller The quality control was not there with this item. The glass was chipped. The scent was ok -
5,25-Aug-19,3,So small. These are way smaller than expected. The price was great when I thought they were double the size that they really are.The smell is good until lit. Then all you smell is fire. They melt away very quickly too. They are very giftable because they are small and cute.
5,18-Oct-20,5,Great Scent. Will buy again Love the scent.  I only burn candles in the evening while I'm watching TV.  Will buy again
5,6-Oct-20,5,Love This Candle Bought this for my granddaughter and she absolutely LOVES it!  The scent is amazing!
5,14-Jan-20,5,pleasant scent has a nice simple scent. I have not yet lit it but i can already smell it surrounding my room.
5,11-Mar-19,5,"Beautiful Scent Love this candle, no black soot and the scent is absolutely lovely. I will definitely be buying again."
5,24-Oct-18,2,"Not fragrant, too expensive I think these are too expensive this scent especially doesn‚Äôt fill a small room. The green ones are at least more fragrant, but not worth the cost."
5,13-May-19,4,Nice but not strong enough Smells great but scent is weak. You have to come really close to it to smell anything.
5,20-Oct-20,5,"Smells Wonderful I love this candle. It is a great size, smells fabulous and the quality is great."
5,2-Mar-20,5,Great This candle smelled great and lasted for a decent period. I would buy them again.
5,26-Jul-19,3,Ok but a little disappointed It was ok but after reading the reviews I thought I made a smart choice. I lit the candle the very day I received it but much to my dismay after 2 hrs of burn time you could hardly notice the scent in my tiny apartment. Oh well.
5,1-Nov-18,3,"Charming Description But Smells Like CK One Cologne Mind & Body: Confidence + Freedom (Oak Moss Amber)Sharp looking candle, just not for me. After the first whiff I imagined my place smelling ""office friendly"" or like a Shopping Mall. A bit disappointed, I returned Redwood Fig and Driftwood candles without even opening the box."
5,8-Sep-20,5,"Smells great! All around beautiful. Smells amazing, very relaxing but can help with happy energy as well. :)"
5,12-Jan-20,1,Don't get it as a gift The wax had areas where it was cracked or empty. It was supposed to be part of a gift but I ended up having to buy something else in a hurry for a secret Santa at work. I ended up keeping it. The scent said lavender but all I smelled was pungent thyme.
5,20-Oct-20,5,The scent is awesome. Bigger than expected and looks great! Beautiful candle. Smells great. Arrived on time and a great addition to my home.
5,3-Jan-19,4,"Definitely Worth It! I think this is definitely worth the ten dollars i paid for it. The only thing would be that the smell wasn‚Äôt as strong as i thought it would be. I do think if you‚Äôre looking for a nice gift to give a candle lover, then this one is perfect. The packaging of the candle is so pretty as well."
5,7-Oct-19,5,Love it I love it but I can only burn it for a few minutes at a time. Maybe my nose is too sensitive. The scent is too strong for me but I still love it.
5,21-Mar-19,5,Best candles ever! The best candles I have ever used! Instantly scents the room shortly after lighting it and keeps it smelling amazing awhile after its blown out. Will keep buying these for my home!
5,22-Apr-20,5,Great candle Has such an amazing calming smell. The color is beautiful and it lasts a long time
5,29-Jan-19,5,"Love , Love these candles Fragrant not too strong JUST perfect and very relaxing - I have purchase 8-10 and love them -also they burn much longer than any Yankee candle"
5,20-Aug-20,3,Meh It's fine - not great. Smell is a bit chemical-y. I had read reviews and expected it to be amazing. Not amazed.
5,9-Nov-20,5,Very pleased Smells amazing and packaged well to avoid damage. Great gift for my sister-in-law
5,20-Sep-19,5,"Great Buy, Will Buy Again! Bought this for a gift. It was a huge success and even had to get one for myself!"
5,8-Oct-19,5,"Great value These were a great gift and I enjoyed some for myself as well, will buy again"
5,23-Mar-19,1,Not sure why great reviews?! The Joy one did not really smell to me at all. I did like the glass and the lid is nice if you use the lid. I typically toss the lid.I felt the candle was .5 better than the grocery store cheap candles.
5,2-Feb-19,4,"Small but great scent This is a great candle to burn at work. It‚Äôs a little smaller than I expected, but the scent is AMAZING!"
5,13-Jan-19,5,"Soothing This is a great candle, especially at this price. Has a lot of scent - as much as some of my 3 wick candles - scent is soothing, not overpowering. Will buy these from now on."
5,10-Jan-19,5,"fresh scent The candle container goes well with my kitchen wall color - Sea Salt! Nice, fresh scent. Not overwhelming."
5,13-Mar-20,1,Smells like scent has gone bad Scent smells like vinegar. Just awful smelling. $20 literally down the drain
5,12-Nov-18,5,"Great natural scent; not overpowering Other reviewers were right: this candle smells great without being too strong. It's a very natural scent, not perfume-y, which I also like. Great purchase."
5,21-Dec-19,5,My favorite! I was really surprised with this candle!It smells lovely and lasts a long time
5,2-Jan-19,4,Nice Candles The cranberry one smells so good I had my hopes set too high for the cashmere jasmine. Still smells really good.
5,12-Sep-19,5,Great value candle These Chesapeake candles are the BEST! I bought several scents and each one is long lasting and smells wonderful. Great value in this brand.
5,17-Sep-18,5,"Heavenly smell Great find, exactly what I was looking for! This is my favorite item to give as a gift! It is always a winner! Incredible smell and it lasts for what seems like forever."
5,1-Nov-20,3,"Looks nice, but really doesn't smell of much at all! This is a very mild scent - nice packaging but nothing to write home about!"
5,14-Oct-20,5,Wonderful scent I have been using this candle about 2 weeks every morning. It has a light scent but strong enough to smell throughout the house. Will definitely buy again.
5,21-Nov-19,5,"Beautiful, delicious scent Beautiful candle perfect for gifts. Amazing smell, not artificial. Beautiful presentation."
5,13-Apr-18,3,"It's a nice size and smell It's a nice size and smell, but it doesn't throw enough scent to fill a larger room. I was looking for a cheaper alternative to bath and body works candles and unfortunately I'm going to have to keep looking."
5,4-Jan-20,5,Love the smell I bought this candle as a gift but it smells so good I want one for myself
5,1-Aug-20,5,Yummy!! Loved the smell - we put it in our bathroom at our cabin and it smells soooo good! Great purchase!
5,4-Jul-18,5,... given the cheap price that this would be a crappy candle. It's actually pretty good I thought given the cheap price that this would be a crappy candle. It's actually pretty good. Smells nice and lasts a relatively long time.
5,15-Jul-19,5,"Great but burn quickly Love these candles, I‚Äôve ordered them many times for my treatment room for work, they do burn really quickly though. They do smell amazing."
5,8-Mar-20,5,Smells great Absolutely loved this candle.  My husband have me two of them for Christmas and they are wonderful. The smell is great and last!
5,16-Aug-19,1,No reed sticks!! Reed diffuser set with no reed sticks included. Gave as a gift a month ago and the recipient just let me know. Not good!!
5,6-Mar-20,3,Smells like nothing when burning Smell isn‚Äôt strong and the wicks were buried in the wax brand new. Had to burn them out. How are they supposed to be calming you if you can‚Äôt even smell them. Rip offffffffff.
5,20-Mar-20,5,Favorite candles! Love these candles.  They burn clean with no black pitch--and smell great.
5,23-Jan-20,1,No smell This candle was smaller than I thought it would be. Has no scent. Don‚Äôt recommend.
5,12-Feb-19,5,"Surprised I really only chose the Awaken & Invigorate candle because it matches my kids bathroom, but I was pleasantly surprised! It smells wonderful. Similar to Bath and Body Works Stress Relief line. Love the jar and lid too!"
5,9-Apr-20,4,"Long Lasting and gentle fragrance. Not quite as strong as I like candles, but gives a gentle fragrance."
5,16-Dec-19,1,Buy a different brand Smells great but only if you get within 6-12 inches of it. Looks good but pointless if you want to smell it
5,17-Mar-20,5,"Gentle, Delicate Scented Candle It‚Äôs a delicate sweet gentle scented candle. I absolutely love this."
5,14-Nov-20,5,Nice for a gift! A very pretty looking and smelling candle! I'm giving it as a gift.
5,24-Feb-20,5,"Wonderful scent Awesome fragrance and quite beautiful..Liked it so much as a gift ,ordered me one."
5,8-Jun-19,1,"Smells rancid, nothing like previous orders I have now ordered two separate orders of the Focus + Patience scent. Both times the scent has been putrid and smells nothing like what its supposed to smell like."
5,27-Aug-19,5,"Very nice candles I love these candles! After about an hour of buring I can smell them through my entire house, which is 3 levels. They have a very peaceful almost therapeutic smell rather then other candles which can be more floral or perfume smelling."
5,4-Jun-19,3,Smells nice...from up close. It smells very nice. HOWEVER sadly the fragrance does not permeates the room like I would‚Äôve liked only when I stand a foot or two away.
5,18-Feb-20,3,"Joy and laughter, it‚Äôs ok Burns fast to me and just smells ok. Would not order again, But it does burn evenly. So that a plus"
5,13-Dec-19,5,"Great candle Great smell, lasts long. I cut the wick a little bit and it burned evenly"
5,12-Jul-19,5,Wonderful! Smelled my whole house Can't say enough about this candle and the scent is so soft and wonderful. Will buy again
5,30-Mar-19,5,Smells great! I love the smell of this candle. I have used it about 10 times for about an hour each time and it is still filled to the top. I would give this as a gift.
5,8-Mar-19,5,"Wonderful Candle I love this candle, it smells great and has lasted a long time.  I recommend this for anyone that wants a relaxing scent in their home."
5,10-Feb-19,5,SPA Omg!!! Got this just to try... it‚Äôs amazing and refreshing... feels like a SPA. I will also buy for gifts
5,2-Jan-19,5,Subtle scent Love this scent! I always buy two or more at a time because I love to keep them burning in the house whenever we are home
5,31-Dec-19,5,Awesome Same Day Delivery and Great Scent! Wow that was a fast same day delivery! It smells great and just what I wanted to give the serene feeling with a great scent.
5,27-Jul-20,3,Wrong scent but nice candle I am not a fan of the scent but it is a quality candle. Perfect gift and burns evenly
5,4-May-19,5,Good smell for guys This is the best scent for a guys apartment.  It‚Äôs not too floral and lasts a while

5,15-Aug-20,2,Not impressed. Not impressed.  Hardly any fragrance. Burned fast. Expensive.
5,12-Apr-20,4,"Sweet citrus similar to a perfume Not my favorite, but a pleasant scent. Long lasting with a great wick and the blue glass is very nice."
5,20-Dec-19,5,Good deal This fragrance is awesome. I use it at nighttime and it helps for relaxation.
5,12-Apr-19,4,Nice color and scent. I wanted a bigger candle for the price and to use with a candle warmer.  They were too small but still pretty.
5,18-Feb-20,2,Candle had a very low level of scent. I was dissappointed with it because the scent was too weak.

5,20-Feb-19,5,"Good Price to smell to longevity ratio I was pleased with the aroma and fill in my ~1000 Sq ft. apartment. Was not overbearing, but not absent either from the living room. Likely to repurchase in the future"

5,14-Sep-20,5,"Beautiful scent Best scent ever! I love it is much, I ordered another one"
5,15-Jul-19,2,"Not worth it. I regret buying. Scent is fine, but weak. Barely notice in the room. Burning twice as fast as described. Wick gets all clumped as it burns. Just not worth it. Looks good, but that's about all in my opinion."
5,24-Apr-20,5,I burned this so fast lol it smells so good! My God this smells amazing! I burned it in a few wks.!!!
5,11-Dec-19,5,FAVORITE ever! I love these! They smell SO GOOD! I have them everywhere!!
5,6-Nov-20,1,No scent. Had no scent. Maybe it was defective. Wouldn't buy again.
5,19-Aug-19,4,"Scent not exactly as described This candle is very attractive, and gives off a subtle scent of mango. Not sure what happened to the grapefruit!"
5,4-May-19,3,Won't buy again I love scented candles but this one had so little scent I won't bother to buy it again.
5,26-Feb-20,5,"Loving the redesign Love the design and the smell, definitely will reorder!"

5,28-Feb-20,5,Smells amazing Great qaulity candle. Love the smell. Would recommend.
5,7-Jul-19,5,Smells nice It's not a strong scent at all and I guess best smells like baby powered mixed with perfume. I wouldn't say it's a wood smell though.
5,19-Dec-18,5,Smells amazing This candle smells way better than I thought it would! The container is really nice as well.
5,10-Nov-20,5,"Soft and subtle scent Really nice scent. Not overpowering at all. You find yourself thinking hey what's that nice smell, and it's the candle. Really soft and subtle scent. I will buy more!"
5,3-Mar-20,5,Smells delicious I would buy this scent again. Seems to be non toxic.
5,29-Mar-19,5,It‚Äôs okay Good for the price but I think it could have been a little bigger
5,17-Dec-19,5,"Long lasting burn, would purchase again. You could smell the candle through the whole house,was so refreshing."
5,9-Feb-20,5,Nice gift I gave this as a gift at Christmas and she loved it! She even called me after she lit it to tell me how amazing it was!
5,3-Jun-19,1,"Stick with Yankee or Bath & Body Works This candle‚Äôs scent is extremely weak! I would never buy this brand again nor would I recommend it to others.As soon as I removed the candle from the box and opened the lid I knew I made the wrong choice.Compared to Bath & Body Works or Yankee candles, this brand sucks!The only positive thing I can say is the jar is pretty....."
5,15-Oct-20,1,Lavendar? lavendar what?  it smells like an unscenced candle.
5,26-Dec-19,5,Great Buy OMG...I am in love with this beautiful soft scent! I will definitely buy it again-and-again.

5,20-Dec-19,5,Great candles Great candle! Smells great and burns a long time
5,12-Aug-19,3,"Not strong enough Can't barely smell it. I like bath and body works candles, figured I'd give it a try. Maybe good for a small bathroom. Otherwise won't be buying it again"
5,5-Dec-18,5,"Amazing scent!! This is the best smelling candle ever, and I normally hate candles! Bought this as a gift and want to keep it for myself! :)"
5,12-Dec-19,5,Best Scent Ever! The scent is amazing! It has a clean and slightly masculine scent that smells so nice.  It definitely makes me breathe better.  Also it does a great job In homes with multiple animals.  Just wished it burned longer.
5,7-Jan-20,3,Smells great until lit The smell once you open it before you light it is AMAZING! But once you light it it STINKS! It is like night and day on this candle.
5,30-Aug-20,5,Lovely scent! Super good buy. Love the scent of this candle.
5,21-Jan-19,5,"Aroma therapy pure I have bought at least three of these and gave them away as a gift. Each time it was a great success. Especially the mind and body version is very pleasant and calming, this is real aroma therapy."
5,10-Aug-19,5,Deliciously scented candle I have had so many compliments on this scent that I have repurchased on several occasions for myself and to give as gifts
5,14-Jul-20,5,nice gift for candle lovers my daughter likes candles this is a good quality product
5,18-Feb-19,1,Wrong scent delivered This was a valentine's day gift and was opened on the day to discover the wrong scent was delivered. Very disappointed.
5,30-May-19,1,"SCENTED CANDLE WITH NO SCENT! The wax smells great, but emits hardly any scent whatsoever while burning. Sent it back."
5,30-Nov-18,5,"Fresh scent, quality candle Ordered Balance + Harmony for a gift and it's just perfect!  high quality look. Considering now to buy more for ourselves! Thanks."
5,30-Dec-19,5,Wonderfully scented Slippers! Lovely scent. Wish it were a bit stronger. Other than that love everything about it.
5,2-Jul-19,1,Doesn't even smell like anything! I burned this candle for two hours and my room smelled the same. You could only smell anything if you went up close to the candle and sniffed it. Waste of money.
5,12-Mar-19,5,"Great Gift My best friend was feeling down, so i mailed her a candle to lift her spirits. she loved it. said the smell was very calming."

5,18-Sep-20,3,Wish it was more potent but still a nice smell! Smell is great but not super long or long lasting
5,2-Nov-20,2,Minimal scent Can‚Äôt smell anything and it‚Äôs been about 3 days now. Hoping eventually I‚Äôll smell something especially given the fact the it was over $12 which i could‚Äôve used to buy a candle or something
5,13-Jan-20,5,Love this candle Smells great. Lasts long. Perfect gift.
5,29-Sep-20,5,I guess it's worth the money Smells good I'm a man I don't have much else to say
5,8-May-18,5,Great smell as long as you only burn one Great smell as long as you only burn one.  It gets too strong when you have more than one in too small of space.

5,1-Mar-19,5,"Smells amazing! This smells so good! It‚Äôs a very relaxing scent, it‚Äôs clean, fresh and not overpowering. I love it!"
5,24-Feb-20,2,Smells like a candle when you blow it out. Otherwise no scent This candle does not smell at all.
5,7-Aug-19,4,Disappointed This product arrived broken. The candle itself was broken‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm not really sure what else to say other than that I was very disappointed

5,9-Apr-18,5,"Good bang for your buck Got this candle to help relax me before bed (I suffer from insomnia so looking for candles with aromatherapy and relaxing scents). However, this is not the best smelling candle in the world (I tried out 3 different ‚Äúrelaxing‚Äù scents from this brand), BUT for the money it‚Äôs great. Would be great for a larger room since smell is quite pungent if burned for longer than 30 mins. Would also be great for the bathroom during holiday dinners to mask any ominous odors since it‚Äôs so strong (haha!).But smell can get a bit obnoxious at times (great quality candles can be burned for hours and always be pleasing), which is not super relaxing.**If you enjoyed my review please vote this review as helpful and feel free to ask me any additional questions and I'll answer them to the best of my abilities.

5,25-Sep-17,1,"I smell nothing. I love candles.  I work at my kitchen island on the computer several hours a day, and usually have one burning about three feet away from me.  That close, you should be able to smell something.  Anything.  I purchased Focus and Patience, and smell nothing.  Zero.  My ten-year-old jokes, ""you need patience to smell it.""  Way too expensive for a plain candle."
5,7-Nov-17,5,Five Stars Smells so good and lasts a long time
5,19-Jan-19,5,N/A Nice burning candle.
5,29-Mar-17,5,I love it! The. Serenity and calm candle has a lovely scent and burns evenly. I love it!The simple but classic look  makes it easy to place in any room.
5,12-Jun-17,5,Five Stars I love this candle! Will re-order for sure!

5,14-Sep-16,5,"very satisfied. very subtle fragrance, very satisfied."
5,28-Jun-17,2,Two Stars Love it but it doeskin last that long!!
5,11-Sep-18,1,Ehh Very little scent to this candle. Disappointing.
5,5-Sep-16,2,Two Stars I like the pink scent better. The blue one smells like a really clean restroom.
5,28-May-18,2,chemical smell Smells more chemical-like than natural. I would not buy again.
5,25-Jan-18,4,"Aroma a bit strong. Candle wick is off center, but doesn't affect burning since it is in a glass container. I prefer no container just because of the addition of glass to my trash/recycling (My area does not take glass.) here.  To me the aroma is a bit overwhelming at close range--not offensive, just a little too strong. Be sure to place it in an area that will not constantly be exposed to close contact with anyone's nose."
5,3-Apr-17,5,"Spa Retreat in my office I bought this for my office and I really love it. It gives such a spa like atmosphere, exactly what I was looking for in a candle! This brand of candle is superior to other name brand candles I have used because it doesn't just smell good unlit, it smells good AND the scent release is superior because it fills the whole room but not in an overwhelming way. Some candles smell good but just don't disperse their scent enough when burning. The fact that these candles do that means I would buy more of this brand. The attractiveness of the jar with it's soft color and frosted glass add to the spa feeling. This is great for my office, but I would also use it at home or for gifts!"
5,13-Jun-17,5,Five Stars Smells great!
5,10-Dec-17,5,Five Stars Smells good
5,23-Jan-18,5,This candle smells amazing. My house smells heavenly all the time now This candle smells amazing. My house smells heavenly all the time now. The candle itself lasts a long time! We have burned it hours on end the jar is still half full. I will forever buy soy candles.
5,16-Dec-18,5,MUST HAVE ITEM IT IS BEAUTIFUL ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE SO BEAUTIFUL
5,26-Apr-18,2,"Where‚Äôs the scent? Very pretty candle! Waited forever for the aroma of all that was labeled! Every now and then I‚Äôd catch a wiff of something pleasant, then it was gone as fast as it came ! My bad for trying a cheaper candle! I‚Äôll stick with manly indulgence, I‚Äôm a lady and I love most of their scents ! No I‚Äôm not advertising for them !! For people who like a weaker scent, this might be it ! I love a stronger scent that fills up the room! So this is not for me & MI is !"
5,29-May-18,5,best buy for all smells I bought these candles and omg! I love the smell and the even burning of them. Have purchased Yankee and believe they are not as strong as they used to be. These burn even when you follow directions and have had no black smoke at all. Everyone who comes into contact loves them and the price is very fair.They give a description of the smells for each one when you arrow down and that's good information.
5,14-Mar-18,1,"ie=UTF8&psc=1 What a disappointment. In order to even get a slight whiff ... https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01N0RSC4K/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o07_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1What a disappointment. In order to even get a slight whiff of this candles scent, you have to stick your nose right on top of the burning candle. If you are looking for something to give your space a relaxing and pleasant smell, don't buy this candle. Neither of the two I bought are good for anything but a little extra light."
5,28-Jul-17,1,"Don't waste your money overpriced and not good quality.  After burning for approx 40 minutes, the wick disappeared,  unable to use candle anymore.  I am going back to Yankee Candle."
5,14-Aug-18,4,Great Scent Loved this diffuser and the scent.  I called the manufacturer and unfortunately there is no way to just buy the diffuser oil by itself.  So the only way I can get more of the oil is if I buy the whole kit again which is wasteful since I already have the glass diffuser.
5,19-Mar-17,5,Best candles ever! I LOVE these candles. They are the best I have ever used. Fragrances so wonderful that permeate the entire room! Excellent at odor elimination. Clean burning-  no black soot. I have four  different fragrances now and plan to order more!  I have all in jar which are classy and plan to try the pillars. Worth every penny and better than Yankee in my opinion!
5,30-Apr-17,5,"Beautiful look and fragrance Over the moon! Bought two of Balance & Harmony. First, packaging was incredible - very impressed with the lengths the manufacturer went to protect the delicate glass. As for the product ""classy and elegant"" are the words that come to mind. Perfect fragrance - peaceful and relaxing. Equal parts decor and usefulness. Practical luxury. Thank you so much!!!"
5,27-Jan-18,5,Five Stars My new favorite candle!
5,8-Jul-18,5,"arrive fast The first one arrived broken. Then, they sent me a new one. But still I need the broken one which kind of a hassle. As for the product itself, I believe it doesn't have strong smell which is good (at least for me)."
5,29-Apr-18,1,Exploded when burned down Ummm.... this candle violently exploded when it burned down. Broken glass everywhere.Smells great but kinda not worth it....!
5,3-Feb-18,5,"Burn perfectly and cleanly, last a long time, scents are modern & delightful These are the BEST candles. They burn perfectly and cleanly, last a long time, and the scents are modern and delightful. Even my boyfriend likes them, and he is very picky (scents in general and candles in particular). Love them."
5,22-Sep-18,5,"Three wicks spread the fragance I accidentally ordered three of these! The smell is divine, the three wicks give the fragrance a boost, makes the whole house smell wonderful-well, we live in a small apartment - I get so many comments when it‚Äôs burning!"
5,25-Apr-18,3,Not a strong scent I was hoping to give a higher review but this candle is OK. It doesnt have a strong scent at all. Love the packaging and marketing but the actual candle is lacking. I am still curious about the other candle scents though.
5,2-May-18,4,Nice candle-not much scent. Lovely candle. I love the size and the scent was ok. Hence the 4 stars. Almost no scent at all and I was giving this as s gift so I was disappointed. But the recipient liked it. It was an apartment warming gift.
5,12-May-17,5,Blissful spa scent Amazing candles. I light them and soon feel like I am relaxing at a spa. Perfection!
5,24-Jun-18,2,"Only get half the product I loved this candle when I first got it. I used it everyday for about 2 weeks and it was awesome! Then, it started melting really weirdly. Halfway through the candle the wick stopped lighting! Smells good but waste of money."
5,25-Apr-18,4,"muskey (Manley) great smelling, best if used in a smaller room Mild smelling, muskey (Manley) great smelling,  best if used in a smaller room."
5,16-Jan-18,3,The candle isn‚Äôt as scented as I‚Äôd like. I can smell it if I‚Äôm within 2-3 ... The candle isn‚Äôt as scented as I‚Äôd like. I can smell it if I‚Äôm within 2-3 feet of it. Otherwise meh
5,3-Jul-18,3,"These are great quality candles and the container is gorgeous These are great quality candles and the container is gorgeous. I ordered several but unfortunately, I don't care for the scent. Return cost is too expensive."
5,12-Oct-18,1,Broken glass does not work well as diffuser. Arrived useless and broken. Shattered within sealed packaging. Was double boxed with plenty of padding. My guess is it was already smashed before being boxed up.
5,7-Dec-16,5,Get this one! Only used a quarter of a bottle to start and it was still very strong and filled the area. Smells great and functions perfectly!
5,1-May-18,1,No smell...maybe for 5 seconds when you first open the jar.... I bought five of these at Christmas time and not one of them smells.  Pretty jar and sentiment.
5,10-May-18,2,Two Stars Like all of this companies candles EXCEPT this one. Smells like cheap perfume
5,16-Jul-18,5,Five Stars I LOVE THE SMELL OF THIS REED DIFFUSER. WISH THEY HAD MORE
5,8-Oct-17,2,"Barely any scent Not much more to say. Burns well, looks nice, but might as well be unscented."
5,8-Feb-18,3,"like I just opened a pack of orbit gum I bought the mint candle. It smells very strongly of mint, like I just opened a pack of orbit gum."
5,8-Jun-18,1,One Star Smelled awful and the ‚Äúcrackle‚Äù was nonexistent.
5,29-May-18,1,Very dissapointed 2 candles came with wick inside candle We ... ?üôÅ
5,1-Oct-17,1,"Arrived Broken, twice Beautiful if would just arrive in one piece. Replacement worse than the first."
5,6-Apr-17,3,"Not very good throw I appreciate the fact that Chesapeake Bay Candle made a ""love and passion"" themed candle that wasn't all jasmine, ylang ylang, and musk.  That always seems to be the go-to for ""romance"" themed scents.  This candle is a very sweet fruity scent.  It's heavy on the mango and something that smells like plum or pear.  It's also very sweet, and it smells like said fruits were boiled with sugar to make a sugary, fruity reduction.  I like the frosted glass of this candle jar, and I like the wooden lid.  Unfortunately, the scent throw is just not there.  I used this candle in the bedroom, and it didn't come close to throwing in just that one room.  I don't know if that problem is specific to this scent, or to the entire line.  I like my candles to be heavily scented and have good throw.  This one just does not.  It's also a bit sweeter than I would prefer, but that is a matter of personal taste."
5,12-Aug-20,5,"This one surprised me My boyfriend bought me this candle for my birthday, and when I smelled it in the jar I was not impressed. He knows I enjoy lavender scents to help me relax, and I didn't have the heart to tell him I didn't like it, so I decided to try to burn it. Well, my mind has completely changed! This candle smells amazing when it's lit. I kind of feel like I am in a spa. I was honestly SHOCKED that I liked it so much after not liking it at all just by smelling it in the jar. Give this one a try!"
5,2-Apr-17,5,"My favorite brand for candles I have been using products from the Chesapeake Bay Mind and Body collection over the past few months.  I like that these scents are clean and natural smelling.  I like that the wax is soy based and that no dyes are used to color.  I love that the packaging can be reused.Love & Pasion is the fourth scent that I‚Äôve owned.  It is fruity and uplifting and lacks the heavy musk or powdery essence often found in romantic or passion fragrances.  It is a great, clean fragrance that stimulates the senses.The jar is made from orange glass and the candle itself is white.  What I‚Äôve found consistently from this brand is that the soy wax is already soft and often does not melt/burn at an equal rate.  When this happens, I use a butter knife to remove the excess wax, then I use it in a wax warmer.  For this purpose, the fragrance lasts about 4 days.The glass used to make these jars is thick and the tall jars can be repurposed as vases.  The candle covers are wood and I‚Äôve used these as coasters.  This is a product that can be completely reused or consumed, which is a bonus to an already fantastic product."
5,7-May-17,5,"Good Scent That Doesn't Overpower The Home This is a hefty candle in a nicely-made, simple glass container with a wooden lid. The lines are clean, not fussy.Before I lit it, I trimmed down the wick so there wouldn't be a huge flame. The wick caught fire without difficulty. I left the candle lit in the kitchen and went off to the living room to read. Gradually I began to notice a pleasant, softly fruity smell filling the room. The scent wasn't overly sweet nor was it cloying. It smelled more like fresh fruit. The scent permeated my home but didn't overwhelm it. I let the candle burn for a few hours and didn't get tired of the scent. When I finally blew the candle out, it didn't seem like that burnt wick smell was as strong or lasted as long as some of my other scented candles do. Also, the level of the candle looked like it had barely moved. The burn was even - no soot on the sides of the glass, no deeper depression around the wick.I'm glad I chose this product to remove. I would recommend it, and would also purchase other candles by this company."
5,24-Mar-17,5,"Relaxing peach and vanilla,Beautiful too! I am enjoying my lovely wonderfully peachy smelling candle as I write this. This is my second Chesapeake Bay Candle, my first being a pillar candle Tropical Waters...that one is nice too. This smells to me like peaches and vanilla, maybe just a hint of musk. Very relaxing.The big plus of this candle for me is that it has a nice frosted glass holder, and a wooden lid which elevates this candle over a plain pillar. Goes with most d?©cor, and is very nice looking. I like that the size of this candle fits my hand comfortably for moving. The Yankee Candles (large) are just too heavy for me and require both hands to pick up and move. I have been burning this candle for over an hour and have no decrease in scent, clean burning, and not really a significant decrease in the wax. I am very pleased with this offering from Chesapeake Bay Candle, and will enjoy. I think I will put these on my gift list, I know several people in my office would love to get this for the secret Santa."
5,30-Mar-17,5,"Love + Passion - citrus scent with grapefruit and mango This is a Chesapeake Bay Candle Mind & Body Collection Large Jar Candle in the Love + Passion option.Love + Passion is described as a Grapefruit Mango combo but it also has some Orange / Peach / Lemon notes.  The description adds berries as a middle note and base notes of coconut and vanilla.  Overall this would be best described as a citrus scent.The candle is a soy-wax with a lead-free wick.  The lid is wood.  The candle will burn up to 70h total with a recommended burn time of less than 4h.The large jar is 6.2"" tall and 3/2"" wide and it has 12.5 oz. wax.This is not my first Chesapeake Bay Candle and it won't be my last.  The burning candle leaves my kitchen and dining area smelling fresh and inviting.Overall - this is a great citrus themed scent and the candle seems to be very high quality.  I would recommend it."
5,2-Jan-19,5,"Minty smell Ordered this for my aunt as a gift. She has a video review, which says that the thyme overpowers the lavender. She also said it is minty."
5,10-Sep-19,5,"Great for a gift! This was a gift for my grandparents on Nat‚Äôl Grandparents Day (Sept 9, make a note to make your gparents feel so loved!!) and my grandma LOVES this candle! It‚Äôs packaging is very presentable and the scent is strong without being overbearing. It burns slightly quicker than I‚Äôd like, but as a cheap gift I‚Äôm not complaining!"
5,14-Nov-20,5,"Beautifully Scented and Presented Purchased as a gift for someine special.Arrived timely and packaged very well.Presents wonderfully. The scent is a perfect balance.Highly recommend as a gift for anyone on your list.Truthfully, think I deserve a gift. May just get one for myself!"
5,31-Mar-17,4,"Candle looks nice (glass does not feel cheap Candle looks nice (glass does not feel cheap, the label is painted on the glass, wooden lid has a rubber gasket to seal in the smell if you rotate candles or store to stop closet from being overwhelmed by smell) I mainly smell the mango and grapefruit in the candle, smells very tropical. will have to update after the candle mostly burns out to comment on amount of time it burns and if smell lasts throughout)  as for size, glass is about 3 inches in diameter by 6 inches tall, candle Is almost 5 inches tall"
5,25-Jan-19,5,Smells Great! Wife loved it and will buy more The candle itself is attractive and looks nice in the house. I got the coffee table one since I have a large space and the 3 wicks help to get the smell around more. The burn rate is reasonable especially since there are three wicks in the coffee table style version. When this one runs out I will try another scent.
5,16-Jun-17,5,"Smells amazing, and a clean burning wax I've used quite a few different brands of candles, and this is one of my new favorites. The smell was clean and fresh with citrus undertones, and it didn't smell fake. I just finished this candle a few days ago. On average I would burn it for an hour or two every other day, and I was using it for about a month an half, so the advertised burn time is reasonable. This also burned cleanly, not producing sooty smoke compared to other candle brands. If you don't mind spending a little more, the quality is well worth the money."
5,7-Jul-19,3,"Great looking candle, don't like the scent. Chesapeake Bay makes great candles, and I usually enjoy them. This scent however, fell flat for me. It smells like a cheap, grocery store candle. The scent is almost too sweet...like a public restroom.The candle itself is pretty. It has a modern, clean look to it. I was very impressed with how well it wrapped up for shipping."
5,30-Mar-17,5,Premium and Wonderful. Love and Passion is a nice fragrance of citrus tones over a coconut vanilla base. It is reminiscent of a dream-sickle or orange pushup mixed with a hint of vanilla. It is refreshing and energizing yet with a kind of silky smooth undertone. It is clean smelling and doesn't clog the olfactory senses like cheaper candles can. The essential oils must add another layer of complexity to the experience as the smell never seems to get boring. Premium soy way blend with natural oils and fragrance. A top shelf premium candle worth of 5 stars.
5,3-Dec-19,5,"Love these candles I've seen alot of negative reviews,  but these people must of gotten a defective bunch. Someone gave my MIL the Peace and Tranquility candle awhile back and it is amazing!!!!..Scent fills the entire upstairs (fairly decent sized house)..I loved it so much I came to buy some as Christmas presents.."
5,31-Mar-17,5,"This a nice size candle This a nice size candle.  The lid is wooden and give it a more quality or expensive look.  The glass is frosted.  The scent is ""love + passion"" and is a warm citrusy scent.  It burns evenly and smells nice.  I prefer citrus smells with most any products that I purchase.I would definitely look at this company for gifting a candle as I do send candles as gifts on occasion.  It is a quality candle, with a nice scent, and looks more modern and upscale than some of the jar candles you see out there."
5,11-Nov-20,1,"Waste of money, Wick stuck in so called wax, very oily. Scent just unboxing and trying to return to Amazon has given me a major headache I can actually taste the scent of the unlit candle...tossing it in trash..."
5,6-Aug-20,5,Great value and not overpowering scent helps relax I received the peace & tranquility as a gift. I can‚Äôt handle strong smells at all of any sort. This candle is light scent but smells wonderful which doesn‚Äôt overpower. I purchased a set for myself immediately before supplies ran short. Great overall satisfaction along with price. Amazon keep this product!
5,3-Nov-19,5,"Long-Lasting. Decorative. Smells Good. Will not Give You Headaches Smells good and is a nice decorative piece, even when not in use. More importantly, this candle does not give me headaches like the cheaper, lower quality ones from Walmart."
5,10-Nov-20,5,"I love the light scent. I like these candles because they have several light scents that aren't too over powering.  I've bought them in the past.  So far, Joy & Laughter is my favorite."
5,12-Jan-19,2,"No wick in the candle????? I am very upset. I bought this candle as a gift for someone and when they tried to use it there was no wick in the candle.  I had it shipped directly to them for Christmas and I am super embarrased they can't use it. I'm giving 2 stars because they told me it smells so good, but hate they cant use it."
5,29-Mar-17,5,"Smells so good I want to eat it. This is a beautiful candle with the frosted glass holder and the nice wooden cap. I received the ""Love + Passion scent and it smells delicious! I have very nosey dogs who have to smell everything that I open from the UPS man. I let them smell this and they thought it smelled good, too. It got the lick of approval from them. Really, I'm sure they wanted to eat it, too. These candles would make great gifts. Very nice."
5,9-Nov-20,5,GREAT GIFT I got this candle as a gift for my best friend. She said she loved the scent. The price was good compared to others like it. I feel like I got a good value!
5,1-Apr-17,5,"Very pleasant and attractive This is a great scented candle in a very heavy, attractive jar. The scent is very pleasant and this is made of first class materials. It also provides some light since the glass is translucent. The top is made of wood but has a silicone rubber gasket that makes a tight seal. This is heavy enough to provide resistance from accidental tipping over. This should last a long time and candle devotees will love this."
5,24-Nov-19,5,"So relaxing and refreshing Absolutely love the scent, it last longer after you blow it out"
5,4-Dec-19,5,Terrific Wonderful candle subtle and refreshing unlike so many overpowering scents. Burns slowly and evenly. Better than many others that are twice the price
5,23-Nov-20,4,Cashmere jasmine baby powder Not sure what I thought cashmere & jasmine would smell like but I didn‚Äôt think baby powder.Pretty candle.
5,26-Mar-17,5,"Rich Beautiful Scented Candle This Chesapeake Bay Candle Mind & Body candle with the love and passion scent is just delightful. It says grapefruit and mango on the label but there is more to this lovely scent, hints of vanilla and florals. The scent is rich and spreads throughout the lower floor of my house. I love the peach colored glass the candle is in as well as the wood cover for the candle. Absolutely lovely candle."
5,3-May-18,5,"Why I love this candle I have not purchased this, but I have spent many visits to the local Target sniffing this candle. Why I love this candle? It reminds me of the courtyard of my apartment in Florence, Italy. Maybe I will get around to buying this when I get nostalgic enough, but I will always recommend this candle."
5,14-Oct-20,5,"Smells amazing! Balance and harmony smells clean and relaxing. I'm a candle connoisseur, and this candle is now at the top of my list to have on hand."
5,7-Jan-19,3,Maybe my smeller (nose) is off. The scents in these candles are nice but very faint. When I am close and smell them they are great but if I am more than 3 feet away - I get nothing.
5,23-Jul-19,5,Smells Amazing! This candle smells amazing! I absolutely love it and will definitely buy it again. Such a refreshing smell!
5,14-Dec-19,5,Great! 2nd purchase FOR A MY BOSS WHO NEEDS TO BREATHE IN TRANQUILITY BECAUSE OF HIS CRAZY STAFF.
5,1-Jan-19,1,No throw This candle has absolutely no throw. You're better off buying candles from Bath and body works
5,25-Jan-19,5,My favorite candle I love candles and this very scent is relaxing. This candle also burns very evenly unlike most other candles and it‚Äôs soy so what‚Äôs not to love? You can have you own little spa retreat from home with this candle. It is worth the money.
5,20-Aug-20,5,love the scent. I bought the Refresh and Rejuvenate. I absolutely love this scent. ?üíï
5,3-Jun-20,1,No wick! Candles need wicks. It‚Äôs kind of the point of a candle.
5,30-Mar-17,5,"A nice candle I'd replace when it's done. The fruity smell is enjoyable, in that it is pleasant but not too intense.I love the wooden top, which helps me feel secure that, in between uses, the candle is fully extinguished, and also makes the candle look nice.With a ""burn time"" of 70 hours, I expect to have it for a while."
5,22-Jan-20,5,Great price. I love this candle. I highly recommend it for yourself or a gift.
5,2-Dec-19,5,Smells Great! My wife loved it! It smells wonderful and came packaged very well with bubble wrap and a box in a box.

5,19-Jan-20,2,Good but not great good option if you dont have a ton of money to spend I wasnt blown away the candle seems to burn away very quickly and the smell doesnt disperses as evenly as other candles do but for the price it was enjoyable.
5,5-Dec-19,5,Arrived with no damage. Packaged well. Smell is amazing. Great purchase
5,16-May-18,2,"Item arrived broken. Because it was sent straight to ... Item arrived broken. Because it was sent straight to (95 year old) grandmother, who lives 2 hours away, it‚Äôs diifficly to box it up and return."
5,18-Dec-18,5,Smells great! Great sized candle in a quality glass container.
5,13-Aug-18,5,"Birthday present for a friend Bought this for a friend and she loved it. Smells fantastic and is a cute, durable product. Came with a free gift tag too which was nice, would have been nice if it was a little more fancier of a tag but it was nice still. Planning to purchase this again."
5,20-Jun-18,1,For the price the smell isn't strong at all I ... For the price the smell isn't strong at all I could've got stronger scented candles from Wal-Mart or maybe it's just my candle
5,19-Jul-19,5,You can get it for the same price at Target Put in a large open space the scent is very strong to strong for a bedroom or bathroom
5,13-Mar-19,5,Long Lasting. If you keep the Wick trimmed! Smells Delicious
5,8-Dec-18,5,Burn the money It is a little pricey. bought as a gift.
5,8-Jul-19,5,Good product Great
5,30-Mar-17,5,Gentle scent This is a tall candle in a frosted glass container with a wooden lid.  Everyone's tastes are different but I like the slightly peachy / floral scent.  It doesn't overwhelm in a large room  Burns evenly.
