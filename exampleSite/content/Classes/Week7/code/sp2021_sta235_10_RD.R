# You receive the sales data for the sales example we saw a couple of weeks ago

sales <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/maibennett/sta235/main/exampleSite/content/Classes/Week7/data/sales.csv")

# Check out the data
head(sales)

# id: identification for each person
# time: time of arrival, since the store opened
# age: age of the person
# female: whether the customer is female or not
# income: average income for the customer
# sales: amount of the purchase
# treat: whether the person received a discount or not (e.g. was within the first 1,000 customers)

# Task 1) Create a plot with the running variable in the x-axis and the treatment variable in the y-axis.
# Questions to answer: 
# i) What is the running variable? Can you obtain the cutoff for treatment assignment?
# ii) What does this plot tells you?

# Task 2) Identify your cutoff score and assign it to c <-
# Add to your previous plot a fitted smooth line for each side of the cutoff adding to your previous code the following:
# geom_smooth(data = filter(sales, time>c), method = "loess", se=TRUE, color = "red", fill = "red")
# and geom_smooth(data = filter(sales, time<=c), method = "loess", se=TRUE, color = "blue", fill = "blue")

# This is the plot you had to do

  geom_smooth(data = filter(sales, time<=c), method = "loess", se=TRUE, color = "blue", fill = "blue") +
  theme_bw()

# If you don't want all markers to be aligned in the same line (it can be difficult to observe),
# you can add a random jitter (move them slightly up and down), so you can see more of the data.
# This is a good trick for any time you have data on the same line.

sales <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/maibennett/sta235/main/exampleSite/content/Classes/Week7/data/sales.csv")
c = max(sales$time[sales$treat==1])

pos = position_jitter(width = 0, height = 0.1, seed = 1234) #I only move them slightly (0.1) up and down. I set a seed so it's reproducible.

  geom_point(data = filter(sales, time<=c), size = 5, pch = 21, color = "white", fill="#900DA4", position = pos) + #I filter the data so I can color units below and above the cutoff
  geom_point(data = filter(sales, time>c), size = 5, pch = 21, color = "white", fill="#F89441", position = pos) +
  theme_bw()

# Question: If you don't want to use the filter function, can you create this same plot using other techniques we have seen?

# Let's look at the densities! We want to see if there's manipulation

# Let's look at the other example, to see if there's manipulation there:

# Task: Fit now a cubic model. What do you find?
