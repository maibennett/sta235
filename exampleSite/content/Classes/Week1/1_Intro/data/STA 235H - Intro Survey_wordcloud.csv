What do you expect to learn in this course?
"I hope to learn how to further develop my analytical and professional writing skills. I am pursuing the pre-med track as well, so the skills I learn in this class in terms of data analytics and communication of complex topics will be helpful in my career as a physician!"
I hope to expand on my knowledge I gained last semester in Stats by further understanding ways to analyze information that can be used to answer a question or solve a problem. It is important to me to learn how to think critically and apply these type of problems to real world situations.
I expect to advance my R skills to be able to visualize even more complex data sets.
I hope to improve my R coding skills and use R more effectively.
"I expect this course to be somewhat of an extension of the STA301 class that we took last spring. Admittedly, I'd say I'm a little rusty on the content from that course, and I'm not completely sure how complementary the two courses are, but having read the syllabus and seen a few mentions of R and RStudio, I assume I'm on the right track."
"I expect to build on and add to the information I learned from STA301. I am excited to learn about regression modeling, causal inference, predictive modeling etc., while applying these concepts to real-world problems.  "
I'm not exactly sure yet! I hope to learn more about coding in R as I found it interesting last year.  
I hope to be able to better understand and apply data science to business
Further applications of R as well as more general knowledge of R as well.

"Not sure yet, but using statistics to make prediction models and learning more R"
How to approach and solve real-world quantitative problems involving extensive data.
"I am not entirely sure of the specifics, but I am hoping to further my knowledge of RStudio as well as statistical concepts. In my mind, the course builds off of STA301, so I am hoping to use this information as a basis and further my knowledge in this subject matter."
A solid understanding of how to interpret and apply business data
More about stats
I expect to improve my ability to quantitatively analyze real world problems through statistical modeling.
"I expect to learn similar concepts that we learned in STA 301H but in greater depth, increasing my knowledge and skill in R that I could apply to future internships and jobs.  "
A better understanding of R
"I'm expecting to learn a lot about analyzing data in R to answer real-world data-driven questions, draw conclusions about populations, and infer/predict other information."
"I expect to learn more data analytics methods and strategies using R, and I think that this course will involve more application of learned material to the the real world compared to STA 301.  "
I hope to be able to apply statistical models and analyses to real world business problems. I want to be able to understand how R and statistical functions can be used in a job or internship in different aspects.  
I expect to learn more R studio knowledge!!
A deeper understanding of data science and how to manipulate large amounts of data.  
I'm not really sure yet. I do want to become more comfortable with R.
"Not sure, I anticipate we build from STA 301 from last semester and apply more data analytics to problems. In STA 301 the focus was mainly on form & understanding how R code works, so I'm thinking that we'll branch off and apply analytics more intensively."
"I don't specifically know, but I assume I will learn more complicated data science tools and methods using R."
I'd love to further develop my R coding skills and learn more about the bell curve and predictive modeling.  
I expect to learn some applicable statistics methods that will be needed in a business career.
I expect to learn about the ways business can use data in order to improve their business practices.

How to apply quantitative reasoning and software to real-life business problems
"I expect this course to be a further elaboration on modeling through R and for it to provide an understanding of how to utilize, connect, and visualize data."
gaining a more advanced skillset to perform advanced regression
Get more advanced experience with R and learn more about data science to build off my experience in STA 301.
I expect to strengthen my R programming skills and get a strong introduction to data science and analytics.
"I expect to become more knowledgeable in different data analytical methods. Last year, in STA 301, we learned some machine learning/predictive models; I hope to become more knowledgeable in this area to be able to build my own predictive models."
I expect to learn what I learned last year on a deeper level in which we will apply our skills to solving real-world problems.
Problem solving with R!
I would like to expand on the modeling concepts that were covered in my freshman stats class.
I am not sure yet.  
"Hopefully, how to tackle statistical questions in practical contexts. I'm also excited to learn R and apply it to my statistics knowledge.  "
I am not entirely sure!
I'm looking forward to learning about using R to analyze data related to business and writing analysis report for the real world examples.
