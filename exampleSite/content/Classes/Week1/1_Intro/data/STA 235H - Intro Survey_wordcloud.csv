I'm not sure
Not sure! Develop my R skills?
uh data analysis?
more real life applications of statistics 
I hope to develop more R skills and gain the understanding of when a certain type of modeling is most relevant (or at least how I could deliberate this). 
I hope to gain a working proficiency in programming using RStudio.
how to use models and R to analyze data and using these analyses for problem solving

Refine R studio skillset

I expect to learn strategies for gaining knowledge from data. 
I hope to learn more about collecting data and using R to effectively analyze it.
Reflect statistics concepts in R code
Sharpen my R skills and learn how to use data analytics to support businesses.
I am not that sure
More R language and ways to represent and interpret data
I'm not sure yet! I expect to build on from what I learned last year though.

I expect to learn more about Data Science as well as grow my skills coding in R-Studio.
How to better understand statistics and become comfortable navigating R
R! 
Creative new ways to use statistics to make better informed business decisions
i dont know 
How to implement stats into business. 
Similar but more extended lessons from STA301 last year
How to use tools like R to process and analyze the enormous amount of data we have access to in a business
Not sure? Data mining?
I expect to dive deeper in my analytical skills than sta301. I am not entirely sure what that will look like but I expect to have to do a lot of analyzing and going from there. I'm super excited.
"I would like to further understand how to use R Studio. Additionally, I would love to get more familiar with analyzing big data because it is so critical in the business world. "
Using computers to help solve math problems
More indepth knowledge about R
"I want to further statistics skills previously built in STA301, and I hope to find real world applications."
not sure yet :)
How to gain significant insights from large datasets
I want to get more comfortable using R Studio! And learn how to apply these skills in a corporate world. 
"I'm not sure, probably a lot of R/Rstudio??"
Analyzing data with programming
"Business science has always been a section of business that I have been very interested in but have never had the opportunity to learn about. I read on the syllabus that we will be learning how to create predictive models, and this is probably the section that I am most excited about. "
I expect to strengthen my understanding of R programming as well as how to apply elements of data science to real life.
Not sure
Probably more modeling techniques and what techniques are best for different situations
I hope to learn methods to analyze data and make sense of data that is applicable to business applications. 
better familiarity with R and Rstudio
To become more comfortable with coding!
