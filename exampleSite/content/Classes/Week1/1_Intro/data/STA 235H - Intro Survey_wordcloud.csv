What do you expect to learn in this course?
I'm not sure yet
I expect to learn how to sufficiently code in R.
More about using statistics in business and coding in R.
I'm not sure 

"statistical modeling, better coding"
How to use R to model business scenarios
"In this data science course, I am hoping to learn more about multiple regression and causal inference."
I want to grow in my comfortability with R coding and learn new statistical skills.


"Not sure yet, but ready to get started"
"I expect to improve my R programming skills, learn how to analyze and present data, and apply quantitative reasoning capabilities to solve challenging business problems."
Data science and some coding

I expect to learn more about R.
How to use R more efficiently!
"I'm not completely sure, but I anticipate we will be expanding on what we learned in STA301 about regression and graphing and etc."
more about data and R 
"Honestly, I am really not sure yet. I expect to be learning how to better utilize R, which is something I actually enjoyed learning about last year!"
Totally unsure

Advancing my knowledge in any way.
How we can better utilize data science in a business environment!
I would like to learn statistics theory and methods that are applicable to business.
How data can be used to solve problems in business
I want to learn how to apply the R skills we learned last year in STA 301 and apply them to actual business applications to see how we might be using R in an internship or job position.
"Skills that build off of STA 309, more in depth use of R"
Better ways to apply stats to business cases

"I expect to improve my R coding skills, construct predictive models, and increase my education within data science for business applications."
A better understanding of statistics!
I expect to learn how to apply statistical tools and skills to solve real-world business problems through a numerical outlook.
"Want to learn about modeling techniques, regression, etc."
"Modeling, regression techniques, applications in the real world"
I'm not sure
Not sure! Develop my R skills?
uh data analysis?
more real life applications of statistics 
I hope to develop more R skills and gain the understanding of when a certain type of modeling is most relevant (or at least how I could deliberate this). 
I hope to gain a working proficiency in programming using RStudio.
how to use models and R to analyze data and using these analyses for problem solving

Refine R studio skillset
How to use R for stats!
I hope to build on the statistical modeling and quantitative reasoning skills that I learned from STA 301H.
More advanced levels of statistics than STA301
