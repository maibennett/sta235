\title{RMarkdown Template}

\maketitle

\hypertarget{rmarkdown-is-awesome}{%
\section{Rmarkdown is awesome}\label{rmarkdown-is-awesome}}

It make take a bit more time, but the flexibility that Rmarkdown gives
you (and the aesthetics üòç) is unbeatable\footnote{If you want to learn
  how to use emojis on your Rmarkdown files, go to
  \url{https://github.com/hadley/emo}}. This file is meant to act as a
template and it includes some basic comments (both here and in the
accompanying .css file), so it can be easily customized.

Don't despair! You might start like this:

\includegraphics{https://github.com/maibennett/sta235/blob/main/exampleSite/content/Classes/Week0/1_Rmarkdown/images/knits2.png?raw=true}

\ldots{} But you'll end up like this:

\includegraphics{https://github.com/maibennett/sta235/blob/main/exampleSite/content/Classes/Week0/1_Rmarkdown/images/cool_beans.jpeg?raw=true}

\hypertarget{pagedown-ftw}{%
\section{Pagedown FTW}\label{pagedown-ftw}}

We are going to be using the package \texttt{pagedown}\footnote{Go to
  \url{https://rstudio.github.io/pagedown/} to read all about it!}. This
is because it's very versatile for transforming documents that need to
be printed (or exported into pdf) and also working on HTML. If you ever
want to transition into making presentations in Rmarkdown (with
\texttt{Xaringan}, of course), this will be an easy step. I also find
css more manageable than the templates created for \(\LaTeX\).

\hypertarget{css-files-are-your-best-friend}{%
\section{.css files are your best
friend}\label{css-files-are-your-best-friend}}

I've included a \texttt{style.css} file that should be included in the
same folder that your Rmarkdown file (for simplicity, I haven't included
a path). There, you can make all aesthetic changes for your document (in
css). The advantage is that you can just copy that file (or create new
ones) for future Rmarkdown templates, and it's great!

\newpage

\hypertarget{lets-see-some-examples}{%
\section{Let's see some examples}\label{lets-see-some-examples}}

\hypertarget{how-latex-works}{%
\subsection{\texorpdfstring{How \(\LaTeX\)
works}{How \textbackslash LaTeX works}}\label{how-latex-works}}

Well, it works pretty much the same as \(\LaTeX\). Include inline
equations like: \(y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1\cdot x_i + \varepsilon_i\), or
multiple line equations:

\[\begin{align}
y_i =& \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{i1} + \beta_2 x_{i2} + \beta_3 x_{i3} +\\
    &\beta_4 x_{i4} + ... + \varepsilon_{i}
\end{align}\]

\hypertarget{lets-code}{%
\subsection{Let's code}\label{lets-code}}

We can write some simple code, if we want to show it (\emph{Tip: Include
\texttt{message=FALSE} and \texttt{warning=FALSE} so you don't get that
extra stuff when you run the code}):

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\FunctionTok{data}\NormalTok{(cars)}

\FunctionTok{lm}\NormalTok{(speed }\SpecialCharTok{\textasciitilde{}}\NormalTok{ dist, }\AttributeTok{data =}\NormalTok{ cars)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
## 
## Call:
## lm(formula = speed ~ dist, data = cars)
## 
## Coefficients:
## (Intercept)         dist  
##      8.2839       0.1656
\end{verbatim}

\newpage

Meh, but that output looks ugly. Can we make it prettier? Let's try
\texttt{stargazer} (you will need to include the
\texttt{results=\textquotesingle{}asis\textquotesingle{}} argument).

Check out the different arguments that you might have, and play around.

\hypertarget{lets-plot}{%
\section{Let's plot}\label{lets-plot}}

Finally, let's briefly look into plots. For this, I'm using the package
\texttt{hrbrthemes}. Check it out
\href{https://github.com/hrbrmstr/hrbrthemes}{here!}.

I'm also saving these as .svg for resolution purposes.

\begin{center}\includegraphics{RMarkdown_Examples_PDF_files/figure-latex/example-1} \end{center}

\ldots{} and for Andrew Baker's sake, we can also rotate the y-axis
label (remember to rename your code chunk!)

\hypertarget{come-to-the-dark-html-side}{%
\section{Come to the dark {[}HTML{]}
side\ldots{}}\label{come-to-the-dark-html-side}}

If you want to see how this would look as HTML, just change your YAML
(i.e.~the header of this document, between --- and ---) for the
following:

I've included a separate R markdown file with this, that you can knit
and see how the HTML file looks. I've also uploaded it \href{}{here}
just for fun ü•≥.

If you want to share your HTML files, a super quick way is

almost always come for \href{https://twitter.com/apreshill}{Alison
