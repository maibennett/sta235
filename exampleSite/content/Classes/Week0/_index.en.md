## Date: August 24th - August 26th

## What we will cover

No in-person class this week for any section, but please complete the following tasks before **Friday August 27th, 11:59 PM**.

## Tasks

1. **Read the syllabus**: We will go through some of the main points of the syllabus during our first class, but please [make sure you review it beforehand](https://sta235.netlify.app/syllabus). That way, you can ask any question you might have during our first meeting!

2. **Install R and R Studio**: If you have not done so, please make sure you install both [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and [R Studio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) on your laptop.

3. **Complete the course introduction survey**: A brief survey to get some additional information from students. There are no right or wrong answers! You can find the survey [here](https://forms.gle/wAnQrZtR64vzgCGD7).

4. **Starting with Rmarkdown**: Rmarkdown is a type of file that allows you to write dynamic documents by mixing code and text (see an example [here](https://www.magdalenabennett.com/files/Rmarkdown_template.pdf)). Even though Rmarkdown will not be required for this course, I'd like to encourage students to use this extension to write their assignments (it's a great tool to have under your belt!). You can follow a quick tutorial on how to set it up [here](https://sta235.netlify.app/Rmarkdown_tutorial).
