# Some reminders

.box-2LA[Homework 2 will be posted today (due in 2 weeks)]

- Get your questions in **.darkorange[early]** (OH or Piazza).

- Run the **.darkorange[R scripts]** posted for each class, and replicate other exercises.

- Slides are now posted in **.darkorange[pdf]** as well.

- The midterm will be **.darkorange[very similar]** to the homework assignments.

# Last week

.pull-left[
- **.darkorange[Potential Outcomes Framework]**
  
  - What are potential outcomes?
  - Definition of causal effects and estimands
  

- **.darkorange[Bias in Causal Inference]**:

# Ignorability Assumption


`$$(Y(0), Y(1)) \perp\!\!\!\perp Z$$`

- Most times, **.darkorange[the ignorability assumption doesn't hold]**

  - Why? (Remember the two types of bias we saw the previous class?)

# The power of randomization

- One way to make sure the ignorability assumption holds, is to do it by design:

.box-6[Randomize the assignment of Z]

i.e. Some units will **.darkorange[randomly]** be chosen to be in the treatment group and others to be in the control group.

.box-4t[What does randomization buy us?]

# Potential Outcomes Framework

Let's introduce some notation:

- Let `\(Y_i\)` be the observed outcome for unit `\(i\)` (e.g. whether I have a headache or not in an hour).
- Let `\(Z_i\)` be the treatment or intervention (e.g. taking a pill).

Then,

$$Y_i | Z_i = 1 \overset{\Delta}{=} Y_i(1) $$
where `\(Y_i(1)\)` is the **.darkorange[potential outcome under treatment]**.

In the same fashion,

$$Y_i | Z_i = 0 \overset{\Delta}{=} Y_i(0) $$
where `\(Y_i(1)\)` is the **.darkorange[potential outcome under control]**.

---
# Potential Outcomes Framework

This means that we can write the observed outcome as a function of the *potential outcomes*:

.box-5LA[$$\rightarrow Y_i = Z_i\cdot Y_i(1) + (1-Z_i)\cdot Y_i(0)$$]

- This definition will be useful because we can see this as a **.darkorange[missing data problem]**.
