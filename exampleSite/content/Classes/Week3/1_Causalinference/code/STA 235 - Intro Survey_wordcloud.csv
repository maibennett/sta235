How to apply statistics to real business problems/situations
"I am super passionate about data science as a prospective career so I hope to equip valuable skills and conceptual understandings that will make me an asset to any team. Namely, I hope to learn more about multiple regression models and machine learning. However, I am ecstatic to learn anything and everything in the realm of data science. "
Data Analytics 
Practical ways a business can build applications to apply statistics or machine learning to enhance performance. 
I would love to be better at coding and interpreting data! STA 301 was really overwhelming so Iâ€™m hoping to learn more this semester.
I am not sure yet
Practice R
I am looking forward to deepening my knowledge from STA 301.
"Time series, hopefully some machine learning (lasso/ridge regression), k nearest neighbor, stepwise regression, 3d models"
Unsure 
"I hope to expand on my skills that I learned in STA 301.. I really enjoyed that class and performed well even though it was fast-paced and hands on! Coding was challenging, but I aspire to become better at it! :)"
