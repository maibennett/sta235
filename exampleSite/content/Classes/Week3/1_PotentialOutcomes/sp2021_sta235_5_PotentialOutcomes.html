# Potential Outcomes Framework

Let's introduce some notation:

- Let `\(Y_i\)` be the observed outcome for unit `\(i\)` (e.g. whether I have a headache or not in an hour).
- Let `\(T_i\)` be the treatment or intervention (e.g. taking a pill).

Then,

$$Y_i | T_i = 1 \overset{\Delta}{=} Y_i(1) $$
where `\(Y_i(1)\)` is the **.darkorange[potential outcome under treatment]**.

In the same fashion,

$$Y_i | T_i = 0 \overset{\Delta}{=} Y_i(0) $$
where `\(Y_i(1)\)` is the **.darkorange[potential outcome under control]**.

---
# Potential Outcomes Framework

This means that we can write the observed outcome as a function of the *potential outcomes*:

.box-5LA[$$\rightarrow Y_i = T_i\cdot Y_i(1) + (1-T_i)\cdot Y_i(0)$$]

- This definition will be useful because we can see this as a **.darkorange[missing data problem]**.

**.darkorange[Data Generating Process]**:
  
  - No direct treatment effect of mailing over emails.
  
  - Pr(Visit | e-mail) &lt; Pr(Visit | mail)
  
  - People that receive a letter are much more encouraged to visit the website, and people that visit the website are more likely to register.

# Is this effect causal?
