# The Fundamental Problem of Causal Inference

- Remember that we can only see one potential outcome 
  
  - E.g. if `\(Z\)` is binary, either `\(Y(0)\)` **OR** `\(Y(1)\)`

&lt;br&gt;
.box-7[Fundamental Problem of Causal Inference]

--

- Need for the **.darkorange[ignorability assumption]**

`$$Y(z) \perp\!\!\!\perp Z \ \ \ \ \ \forall \ z\in Z$$`
--

- Most times, **.darkorange[the ignorability assumption doesn't hold]**

  - Why? (Remember the two types of bias we saw the previous class?)
  
---
# Ignorability Assumption


`$$(Y(0), Y(1)) \perp\!\!\!\perp Z$$`


- Most times, **.darkorange[the ignorability assumption doesn't hold]**

  - For ATE:
  
.box-2t[Selection bias]
&lt;br&gt;
.box-4t[Heterogeneous treatment effect bias]

# The power of randomization

- One way to make sure the ignorability assumption holds, is to do it by design:

.box-6[Randomize the assignment of Z]

i.e. Some units will **.darkorange[randomly]** be chosen to be in the treatment group and others to be in the control group.

# Can we ensure balance?

- In RCTs, in general, you can't ensure balance on all covariates.

- But you can **.darkorange[stratify]**!
--

- Stratification means dividing your data into different stratas or groups *S*, based on one or more covariates.

- Then, you randomize in the same way *within strata*.

# SUTVA: No interference

- *"The treatment applied to one unit does not affect the outcome for other units"*

--

- Imagine we have two individuals, 1 and 2:

  - `\(Z_1\)` and `\(Z_2\)` will be the treatment assignment for 1 and 2, respectively.
  
  - Under SUTVA:

# SUTVA: No hidden variations of treatments

- *"An individual receiving an specific treatment level cannot receive different forms of that treatment."*

  - Individual 2 gets an **.darkorange[old aspirin (aspirin -)]**
