# Videos

I will be making short videos to help you solve some common issues in R coding, but also with respect to the class material, as needed.

### Scatter plot?

In this video, I go over scatter plots and, in particular, how to do a scatter plot with two groups.

- [Here](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~tzheng/files/Rcolor.pdf) you can find names of colors for R (but you can also use HEX colors)


### Cleaning data?

It's very important to have a good grasp on some basic tidyverse functions, such as `filter` and `mutate`. In this video, I go through them with a toy data set that is easy to undertand

### Logarithms and Regressions: The why

In this video I briefly go through the math of why we interpret changes in logarithms as percentage changes.

### Heteroskedasticity

What is this strange word and can we see it in data? What are the implications in terms of inference? Let's see!
