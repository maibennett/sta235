# Videos

I will be making short videos to help you solve some common issues in R coding, but also with respect to the class material, as needed.

### Scatter plot?

In this video, I go over scatter plots and, in particular, how to do a scatter plot with two groups.

- [Here](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~tzheng/files/Rcolor.pdf) you can find names of colors for R (but you can also use HEX colors)


### Cleaning data?

It's very important to have a good grasp on some basic tidyverse functions, such as `filter` and `mutate`. In this video, I go through them with a toy data set that is easy to undertand

### Logarithms and Regressions: Interpretation

Short explanation on how to interpret coefficients and associations when Y or X (or both!) are in logarithms. *Note: Only watch until the 3:21 mark.*

### Logarithms and Regressions: The why

In this video I briefly go through the math of why we interpret changes in logarithms as percentage changes.

### Heteroskedasticity

What is this strange word and can we see it in data? What are the implications in terms of inference? Let's see!

### Difference between percentage points and percent?

Let's go over the difference between a percentage point change and a percent change, and when do we use each in the context of regressions.

<!-- ### Matching Example

Let's go through the code for the GOTV matching example!

### RDD Example

Let's go through the code for the RDD example for minimum legal drinking age and arrests.

### Lasso Regression

Here, I go through the code for the in-class activity for Week 11, particularly, the code for Lasso regression.
