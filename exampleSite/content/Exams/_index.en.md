# Exams

## Midterm

### About the exam

- The midterm will be conducted in person during class time on the week of October 16th.

- The exam will last approximately 1hr 40min, including submission time (e.g. uploading all files). 

- The structure will be very similar to homework assignments: A combination of conceptual questions and work with data.


### Things that you will need for the test

- A laptop (make sure that is charged and it can support 1.40hrs of work). Given the classrooms we have been assigned, <u>do not assume you will have access to a charger</u>.

- R and RStudio.

	- Make sure you have all the packages you might need installed. In particular, the packages that we have covered in class will be required for the exam, so have them installed beforehand.

- Any class notes or R scripts you might need. These files need to be downloaded to your computer. You will not be able to access any online resource (e.g. course website, chatGPT, googledocs), so download anything you might need beforehand.

	- I'd recommend making a short summary document (cheat-sheet) with must-haves, so you don't waste time going through too much material.


### Exam rules

- We have four sections taking the midterm, so remember that any sharing of information is not allowed. As a note, midterm grades will be curved, so how other sections perform will affect the curve for your grade as well.

- During the exam, you cannot have access to any online resources or outside sources. Feel free to use any notes you might have, though, or look over past Rscript examples.
