# Exams

Here you will find information and exercises for the midterm and final exam.


## Midterm

### Information

- You will need a **webcam**

- **Wired connections** are recommended, if possible (for stable internet).

- Only justified absences are allowed. In that case, your midterm grade will be replaced by your final exam grade.

- You will be required to code in R. Remember to install all packages we have seen in class and homework assignments.


### Exercises

Here are some exercises (focused on R) that cover the type of coding you should expect for the midterm <a onclick="ga('send', 'event', 'External-Link','click','code_midterm','0','Link');" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/maibennett/sta235/main/exampleSite/content/Exams/code/sp2021_sta235_midterm_exercises.R" target="_blank" class="btn btn-default">Download<i class="fas fa-code"></i></a>



## Final

### Information

- You will need a **webcam**

- **Wired connections** are recommended, if possible (for stable internet).

- You need to attend the final exam on May 13th (from 2.00pm to 5.00pm), **unless you have been given direct approval by the professor.** If you are not sure whether you have approval, check the list of students sent out in Canvas. If you are not there, you are not being considered for the make-up exam.

- The make-up exam will take place on May 17th (from 2.00pm to 5.00pm). **It will be a different final than the original one, and questions will be randomized for each topic to go on one or another exam, for fairness.** A reminder, as well, that finals will most likely be curved.

- **You will be required to code in R**. Remember to install all packages we have seen in class and homework assignments.


### Exercises

Here are some exercises that cover the type of questions you should expect for the final. It is not an exhaustive list, but make sure you have gone through the code we have seen in class, as well as the questions that are posed there (both in the code and in the slides).
