# Exams

## Midterm

### About the exam

- The midterm will be conducted in person during class time on the week of October 16th.

- The exam will last approximately 1hr 40min, including submission time (e.g. uploading all files). 

- The structure will be very similar to homework assignments: A combination of conceptual questions and work with data.

### About HonorLock

- HonorLock is the proctoring system we will use for the exam. You will have a practice quiz on Canvas so you can get familiar with it.

- HonorLock only works on Chrome (similar to Proctorio), and it will prompt you to install an extension the first time you use it.

- You will access any proctored exam/quiz on the **HonorLock tab in Canvas** (do not enter through Assignments, because it will require a code and you won't be able to open the test).

- Do not worry about any notifications/warnings sent by HonorLock. I'll try to disable all the ones I can, but these should not be a cause of concern. 


### Things that you will need for the test

- A laptop (make sure that is charged and it can support 1.40hrs of work). Given the classrooms we have been assigned, <u>do not assume you will have access to a charger</u>.

- R and RStudio.

	- Make sure you have all the packages you might need installed. In particular, the packages that we have covered in class will be required for the exam, so have them installed beforehand.

- Any class notes or R scripts you might need. These files need to be downloaded to your computer. You will not be able to access any online resource (e.g. course website, chatGPT, googledocs), so download anything you might need beforehand.

	- I'd recommend making a short summary document (cheat-sheet) with must-haves, so you don't waste time going through too much material.


### Exam rules

- We have four sections taking the midterm, so remember that any sharing of information is not allowed. As a note, midterm grades will be curved, so how other sections perform will affect the curve for your grade as well.

- During the exam, you cannot have access to any online resources or outside sources. Feel free to use any notes you might have, though, or look over past Rscript examples.

- Because this is a proctored exam, you will not be allowed to use any device that has an internet connection and is not proctored (e.g. tablets, iPads, phones), so please make sure all your materials are on your laptop.
