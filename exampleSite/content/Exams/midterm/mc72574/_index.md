# Instructions

- This exam was created exclusively for <<FirstName>> <<LastName>> (EID: <<EID>>), and every exam is different. You will be graded on the context of this exam.

- **Please don't communicate with anyone during the exam time, including after you have finished.** If there is any evidence of plagiarism or copy, all involved students will be referred to the Dean's Office.

- Take a moment to **read the exam**, and ask any questions you might have promptly through the chat.

- Make any assumptions you deem necessary, but **write them down explicitly**.

- **Short, precise answers are always better**. Don't think you have to write paragraphs and paragraphs.

- If at some point you get stuck with the R-code and cannot debug your code, **try to finish it even if it doesn't compile**, and indicate where you had the problem. You could get additional points if the syntax is overall in the right direction.

- If you use any outside sources or ideas that are not your own, **please reference them appropriately**.
