**Office hours will be held in-person on a first-come-first-serve basis**. However, given that we are still in a pandemic, I encourage you to reach out to schedule a virtual appointment if you are not feeling well. 

Teaching assistants may be emailed at their official UT email and will hold office hours based on the schedule below.
