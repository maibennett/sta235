# Syllabus

Please read the syllabus. It has important information about the course, including structure, assignments, grading, and office hours, among many others. [Here's some Snoop Dog](https://www.cameo.com/v/5f2b392a0299b100202e624a?utm_campaign=video_share_to_copy) so you're motivated to read it.

## Introduction

Our class meets on Mondays (Section 1: 12:30 – 2:15 PM, Section 2: 2:30 - 4:30 PM), streaming online via our course website on Canvas.

The objective of this course is for you to gain the tools you need to tackle real-world problems from a quantitative perspective. We will be covering topics on regression modelling, causal inference, and predictive modelling. You will have the opportunity to be exposed to an array of different real-world examples, get hands-on experience in working with data, and improve your R coding skills for data science. 

Your success in this class is important to me. These are difficult times, and I am committed to making appropriate accommodations that meet your needs and also allows you to complete the requirements of this course. My goal is for you to learn everything you were hoping to learn in this class.

If you feel you are falling behind or that there are any aspects of this class that are preventing you from learning, reach out to me or a teaching assistant as soon as possible, so we can work something out. We also encourage you to reach out to the student resources available through UT, many of which are listed on this syllabus.

All office hours are held via Zoom and you can register through [calendly](https://calendly.com/maibennett/sta-235-office-hours?month=2021-01). The teaching assistants will also hold office hours based on a scheduled TBD. **If you have a conflict with office hours (e.g. another class is scheduled at the same time), please email us so we can set up another time to meet.**


## Course Overview

### UNIVERSITY CATALOG COURSE DESCRIPTION:
Data science for business applications at the intermediate level. Topics include advanced multiple regression, causal inference, and construction and validation of predictive models. Additional topics will be included if time allows it, such as models for time series, and models for text data analysis.

### PRE-REQUISITES FOR THE COURSE
Statistics 301 or Statistics 301H, Mathematics 408Q or credit registration for 408D, 408L, or 408S. 

### COURSE FORMAT
This class meets online on Mondays from 12:30—2:15 PM (Section 1) or 2:30-4:15 PM (Section 2). Attend class by logging into the **Canvas class page**. Lectures are streamed live via Canvas and will include class activities, short quizzes, and discussions. Visit the [24/7 test stream](http://www.laits.utexas.edu/tower/tech.html) to test your computer and network connection before classes start. If you need help, look for "Online Course Tech Support" in the left navigation menu of your Canvas course. 
 
### COMPUTER HARDWARE & SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS
-	Laptop or desktop computer
-	Modern and updated operating system (MacOS or Windows)
-	Chrome (highly recommended), Safari, or Firefox web browser
-	Install the latest versions of `R` and `RStudio` software. These programs are free, require no registration, and will run on Macs, PCs, or Linux machines. Note that you need both programs; even though we’ll interact with RStudio rather than R directly, you still need a copy of R installed on your computer for RStudio to work.
-	5Mbps internet connection speed ([check your speed here](http://www.speedtest.net/))
-	Ensure your microphone and webcam work properly. These will be encouraged during class and will facilitate discussions. These will also be particularly useful for getting the most out of office hours with the professor and TAs.

For the optimal in-class experience, I suggest that you:
-	Close all unnecessary browser windows and tabs and programs.
-	Clear the browser's cache before class ([here's how](http://www.refreshyourcache.com/en/home/)).
-	Check that your computer is free of viruses, malware, and spyware ([UT recommendations](https://security.utexas.edu/education-outreach/anti-virus)).


### HOW TO SUCCEED IN THIS COURSE:

1)	Attend class each day and listen carefully, just as if you were in a traditional in-person classroom. If something is unclear, don’t be afraid to ask a question. Active participation in class enhances the learning experience for everyone!
2)	Every lecture session will be recorded, and you’ll be able to view these recordings after the fact via Canvas. Slides will also be available after class, so don’t focus as much on transcribing, but focus on understanding the key concepts.
3)	Asking questions in class is always a good thing! It helps clear the material not only for you, but probably for other students as well. However, if you require additional help, I encourage you to attend office hours. These are designed to help you solve any questions outside the classroom, so take advantage of this instance. Please watch this video on understanding why office hours are important and how they usually work: https://vimeo.com/270014784 
4)	Complete all readings and assignments by the suggested date on the course outline posted on Canvas. Readings, homework, and other assignments will help you prepare for the midterm and the final exam, and identify potential questions you might have about the material (see num. 3). If you feel you are falling behind for any reason, please contact me or a TA as soon as possible. We can certainly work with you in finding a suitable solution if we have enough time to do so.
5)	Get an early start on the homework assignments, and follow the submission guidelines. Given the uncertainty of current times, this will also help you have a better handle on your work if there are other unforeseeable disruptions.
