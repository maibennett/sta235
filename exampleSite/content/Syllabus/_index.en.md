## Introduction

Our class meets on Mondays (Section 1: 12:30 – 2:30 PM, Section 2: 2:30 - 4:30 PM), streaming online via our course website on Canvas.

The objective of this course is for you to gain the tools you need to tackle real-world problems from a quantitative perspective. We will be covering topics on regression modelling, causal inference, and predictive modelling. You will have the opportunity to be exposed to an array of different real-world examples, get hands-on experience in working with data, and improve your R coding skills for data science. 

Your success in this class is important to me. These are difficult times, and I am committed to making appropriate accommodations that meet your needs and also allows you to complete the requirements of this course. My goal is for you to learn everything you were hoping to learn in this class.

If you feel you are falling behind or that there are any aspects of this class that are preventing you from learning, reach out to me or a teaching assistant as soon as possible, so we can work something out. We also encourage you to reach out to the student resources available through UT, many of which are listed on this syllabus.

## Course Overview

### UNIVERSITY CATALOG COURSE DESCRIPTION:
Data science for business applications at the intermediate level. Topics include advanced multiple regression, causal inference, and construction and validation of predictive models. Additional topics will be included if time allows it, such as models for time series, and models for text data analysis.

### PRE-REQUISITES FOR THE COURSE
Statistics 301 or Statistics 301H, Mathematics 408Q or credit registration for 408D, 408L, or 408S. 

### COURSE FORMAT
This class meets online on Mondays from 12:30—2:15 PM (Section 1) or 2:30-4:15 PM (Section 2). Attend class by logging into the **Canvas class page**. Lectures are streamed live via Canvas and will include class activities, short quizzes, and discussions. Visit the [24/7 test stream](http://www.laits.utexas.edu/tower/tech.html) to test your computer and network connection before classes start. If you need help, look for "Online Course Tech Support" in the left navigation menu of your Canvas course. 
 
### COMPUTER HARDWARE & SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS
-	Laptop or desktop computer
-	Modern and updated operating system (MacOS or Windows)
-	Chrome (highly recommended), Safari, or Firefox web browser
-	Install the latest versions of [`R`](https://www.r-project.org/) and [`RStudio`](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) software. These programs are free, require no registration, and will run on Macs, PCs, or Linux machines. Note that you need both programs; even though we’ll interact with RStudio rather than R directly, you still need a copy of R installed on your computer for RStudio to work.
-	5Mbps internet connection speed ([check your speed here](http://www.speedtest.net/))
-	Ensure your microphone and webcam work properly. These will be encouraged during class and will facilitate discussions. These will also be particularly useful for getting the most out of office hours with the professor and TAs.

For the optimal in-class experience, I suggest that you:
-	Close all unnecessary browser windows and tabs and programs.
-	Clear the browser's cache before class ([here's how](http://www.refreshyourcache.com/en/home/)).
-	Check that your computer is free of viruses, malware, and spyware ([UT recommendations](https://security.utexas.edu/education-outreach/anti-virus)).


### HOW TO SUCCEED IN THIS COURSE:

1)	Attend class each day and listen carefully, just as if you were in a traditional in-person classroom. If something is unclear, don’t be afraid to ask a question. Active participation in class enhances the learning experience for everyone!

2)	Every lecture session will be recorded, and you’ll be able to view these recordings after the fact via Canvas. Slides will also be available after class, so don’t focus as much on transcribing, but focus on understanding the key concepts.

3)	Asking questions in class is always a good thing! It helps clear the material not only for you, but probably for other students as well. However, if you require additional help, I encourage you to attend office hours. These are designed to help you solve any questions outside the classroom, so take advantage of this instance. Please watch this video on understanding why office hours are important and how they usually work: https://vimeo.com/270014784 

4)	Complete all readings and assignments by the suggested date on the course outline posted on Canvas. Readings, homework, and other assignments will help you prepare for the midterm and the final exam, and identify potential questions you might have about the material (see num. 3). If you feel you are falling behind for any reason, please contact me or a TA as soon as possible. We can certainly work with you in finding a suitable solution if we have enough time to do so.

5)	Get an early start on the homework assignments, and follow the submission guidelines. Given the uncertainty of current times, this will also help you have a better handle on your work if there are other unforeseeable disruptions.

## Week-by-Week Outline

Below you will find a general outline of the topics we’ll cover in this course. All other materials regarding homework assignments, readings, and other information will be posted on Canvas. Depending on how the class progresses, the order of these topics might change, so check Canvas regularly for an updated version of this outline:

## Course Requirements and Grading

### REQUIRED MATERIALS

There are two required textbooks for this course:

-	Angrist, J. & J. Pischke. (2015) “Mastering Metrics”. Princeton University Press.
-	James, G., D. Witten, T. Hastie, & R. Tibshirani. (2017) “An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R”. Springer. (Available online [here](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5ff2adbe3fe4fe33db902812/t/6009dd9fa7bc363aa822d2c7/1611259312432/ISLR+Seventh+Printing.pdf)) 

All lecture slides, supplemental readings, course videos, and additional material will be provided via Canvas.


### ATTENDANCE EXPECTATIONS
I expect all students will attend virtually each class by logging on time via Canvas. Attending class is the easiest way to learn the different topics that will be covered in class and ask questions. However, given the current global pandemic we are living through, attendance will not count towards your final grade. Students will be required to complete Just in Time Teaching assignments (JITT) before some of the classes, and these will be considered in your final grade (see “Grading and Assignments” below). 

### BEHAVIOR EXPECTATIONS
You should think about this online class the same way you would think about an in-person class. The same rules of courteousness and professionalism apply here! To the best of your abilities, try to avoid outside distractions and keep your focus on the lecture. However, if you have other responsibilities that do not allow you to fully concentrate on the lecture (e.g. childcare), please reach out to the teaching team and we will work out a plan to help you succeed.
Depending on the size of the class, questions can be asked by unmuting yourself or through the online chat. I ask to keep the comments and questions in the chat relevant to the lecture, both in public and private chats.
I have a zero-tolerance policy for racist, sexist, xenophobic, homophobic, or any sort of disrespectful language or behavior towards anyone in this class, including other students, TAs, or the instructor. Any student violating this policy will be referred to the Dean’s office for disciplinary proceedings. 

### GRADING AND ASSIGNMENTS
There will be one online midterm and one final exam in this course (via Zoom). Additionally, there will be three homework assignments during the semester, a prediction data project, and Just in Time Teaching assignments (JITT) that should be completed before each class:
1.	Homework assignments: 20%
2.	Prediction Project: 15%
3.	JITT assignments: 10%
4.	Midterm: 25%
5.	Final: 30%

I will use the cutoffs below to translate your overall course average into a final letter grade. These cutoffs are firm; we do not round course averages. So, for example, an overall course average of 89.99 is a B+, not an A-. I sometimes (but not always) curve grades, but it will always be in your favor. For forecasting purposes, assume your grade will not be curved. 

|Grade|A|A-|B+|B|B-|C+|C|C-|D|F|
|-----|-|--|--|-|--|--|-|--|-|-|
|Cutoff|94%|90%|87%|84%|80%|77%|70%|65%|60%|<60%|

I now explain each of these grading components in more detail. 

1.	**Homework assignments (20%)**

-	There will be three homework assignments in this course, with the following submission deadlines:
	- HW1: February 15th, 12:00 PM (noon)
	- **HW2: March 8th, 12:00 PM (noon)** (*Note: Date was changed to accommodate suspended classes due to winter storm.*)
	- **HW3: April 14th, 12:00 PM (noon)**
-	Homework assignments will be posted on Canvas and submitted through Canvas.  
-	You must submit your homework write-up as a PDF. No other file format is acceptable. Both MS Word and Google Docs have an option to save your document as a PDF.
-	You need to submit the R script(s) that you use to complete each and every homework assignment, and submit it along with your write-up. Failure to submit your script will be considered as an incomplete homework. The code you submit with your homework should be fully reproducible (i.e. another person running it on their machine should be able to get the same results as you). See guidelines in our course website for R scripts.
-	You will be penalized with 10 points for each day your assignment is late. This penalty is to give everyone the same amount of time to submit their work. If you know you will not be able to submit the homework on time, please reach out to the teaching team as soon as possible (ideally, before the deadline). 

2.	**Prediction Data Project (15%)**
-	A longer homework assignment for students to use, test, and compare different prediction models with real world data.
-	Submission rules are the same as the ones stated for homework assignments.
 
3.	**Just in Time Teaching Assignments (10%)**
-	Mini-assignments to be completed before class that should not take more than 15 minutes to complete. These might include questions related to the readings, watching a short video, or answering some questions related to the topics of this class. 
-	The objective of these assignments is for you to think about the topics that will be covered in this class, motivate the discussion, and at the same time provide additional feedback for the instructor about where the students stand.
-	These assignments will not be graded for their content, but just for their completion. That being said, your submission should reflect that you tried to answer the questions appropriately. 
-	JITT assignments need to be completed the day before the class (i.e. if your class is on Monday, you should submit your answers before 11:59pm on Sunday).

4.	**Midterm and Final Exam (25% and 30%, respectively)**
-	Both exams will cover all topics covered in class, up to a week before the date of the exam. In the case of the final exam, even though it will heavily focus on the second part of this course, it can also cover topics that were discussed on the midterm.
-	Both exams will be taken online via Zoom either during regular class hours (midterm) or during a **common time assigned to both sections (May 13th 2:00-5:00 PM)**. *If you have a schedule conflict for this date and time, please let me know as soon as possible.*

{{% notice info %}}

You will need a working webcam for both the midterm and the final exam, so make sure you secure one with enough time for both dates. 

To the best of your abilities, try to ensure you have a stable internet connection (e.g. connect your computer physically through an ethernet cable, take your exam somewhere you know the connection might be better (UT library, for example, if you are close to campus)).

There will be no make-up exam for the midterm. If you have any issues, your final exam will count both as your midterm and final.

## Course Policies

### COMMUNICATING WITH THE INSTRUCTOR TEAM

1.	Email address: m.bennett@austin.utexas.edu 

-	Use the following subject: “[STA 235] Your subject”
You can email me directly with individual questions related to the course administration, for example, about learning accommodations or a conflict with a religious holiday. For specific questions about an assignment, I recommend you copy a TA as well in your email. TAs can provide specific responses to assignment questions, but you should email me directly if there are any issues related to re-grading or extensions, for example. 

	I will usually respond within one business day, but sometimes it might take me two. If you haven’t heard back from me, please send me another email (and include the course number in the subject line!). 
If you send general questions about course content or assignments to a TA or me, we will likely respond to suggest that you post the question on Piazza.

-	Style Guide: It is important to be courteous in a professional environment, both in university and on the labor market. This might be redundant to many of you, but I have found it helps to highlight some of these points to avoid potential issues (and make a good impression in your professional life!):
	- Always use an appropriate greeting in your emails (e.g. “Hey,” it’s probably not the greeting you want to use unless your addressing a close friend, while “Hi Professor Bennett,” is an adequate greeting).
	- Be succinct while addressing the purpose of the email, but include all relevant information. If it’s the first time you are emailing someone, the Iñigo Montoya introduction structure is usually a good idea.
	- Sign your emails with an appropriate goodbye and your name. 

2.	Piazza Discussion board, accessible via this link and/or the left menu link on our Canvas home page. 
If you have a question about content covered in a class session or assigned reading, about instructions for a homework assignment, about the intuition behind a knowledge check question, about R, or something similar: post your question on Piazza. If you have a question, it is likely that other students are wondering the same thing. Piazza is monitored regularly by the TAs and instructor and will often be the fastest way to get help. Students are also able to post responses to peers’ questions and we encourage you to do so. We also encourage you to post links to interesting articles related to data science or useful R videos you found on YouTube. Using the Piazza discussion board is a great way to tap into the collective intelligence of all participants in this class: students, TAs, and professors.
Do not send messages via Canvas to individual instructors or TAs. Use our email addresses or post on Piazza instead for a timely response. 

### COLLABORATION, STUDY PARTNERS/GROUPS, AND ACADEMIC INTEGRITY
In addition to the general UT policies regarding academic integrity that are described below (and in the UT Course Catalogue), this course has a few other specific policies.

-	You are encouraged to form study groups. Collaboration is key for learning! However, you are not allowed to copy directly from another student or let someone else copy from you. This means that you cannot pool submissions and divide homework questions between a group. You are responsible for your entire work.

-	These same rules apply to R code. You are encouraged to discuss potential problems, but you need to write your own R code. In any case where we suspect cheating, we will compare both R scripts and homework write-ups, and all students involved will receive an F in this course and be referred to the Dean’s office for further disciplinary proceedings (and further potential academic consequences).

-	To avoid any potential conflicts, please do not share your files with another student. This is also considered cheating and you will be subject to the same disciplinary actions stated above.

-	All students in this course assume responsibility for abiding by these policies. If you are unsure about whether a specific type of collaboration crosses the line into copying, then just ask us.

-	Also remember to use references and give credit were credit is due. If you are taking an idea from one of the readings, a book, or an online resource, please cite the work appropriately. Plagiarism from other sources (not just other students) will also be penalized.

### NAME AND PERSONAL PRONOUN PREFERENCE
It is very important to me that a respectful environment is fostered in this class, and that also includes referring to everyone by their preferred name and pronouns (and also pronouncing those names correctly!). Instructors are provided class rosters that only include your legal name, so I will send out an additional survey collecting both preferred names and pronouns.

Canvas now also allows for students to record their name pronunciation. This would be very helpful if you feel your name is often mispronounced!

For written interactions, if your preferred name does not match your legal name, please include it in your chat question/comment or your email. For example, in the classroom chat, if your name is Peter and you would like to be referred to as “Pete”, include it in parenthesis as following:

“Peter Smith: (Pete) I had a question about that last topic.”


## University Policies

### ACADEMIC INTEGRITY
Each student in the course is expected to abide by the University of Texas Honor Code: “As a student of The University of Texas at Austin, I shall abide by the core values of the University and uphold academic integrity.” Academic dishonesty and plagiarism are taken very seriously at UT. If you use words or ideas that are not your own (or that you have used in previous classes) in your homework write-ups, you must cite your sources. Otherwise you will be guilty of plagiarism and subject to academic disciplinary action, including failure of the course. You are responsible for understanding UT’s Academic Honesty and the University Honor Code which can be found at the following web address: deanofstudents.utexas.edu/conduct

### Q DROP POLICY
If you want to drop a class after the 12th class day, you’ll need to execute a Q drop before the Q-drop deadline, which typically occurs near the middle of the semester. Under Texas law, you are only allowed six Q drops while you are in college at any public Texas institution. For more information, see: ugs.utexas.edu/vick/academic/adddrop/qdrop

### SHARING OF COURSE MATERIALS IS PROHIBITED
No materials used in this class, including, but not limited to, lecture hand-outs, videos, assessments (quizzes, exams, papers, projects, homework assignments), in-class materials, review sheets, and additional problem sets, may be shared online or with anyone outside of the class unless you have my explicit, written permission. Unauthorized sharing of materials promotes cheating. It is a violation of the University’s Student Honor Code and an act of academic dishonesty. We are well aware of the sites used for sharing materials, and any materials found online that are associated with you, or any suspected unauthorized sharing of materials, will be reported to Student Conduct and Academic Integrity in the Office of the Dean of Students. These reports can result in sanctions, including failure in the course. 

### CLASS RECORDINGS
Class recordings are reserved only for students in this class for educational purposes and are protected under FERPA. The recordings should not be shared outside the class in any form. Violation of this restriction by a student could lead to Student Misconduct proceedings.


## University Resources for Students

### SERVICES FOR STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES

This class respects and welcomes students of all backgrounds, identities, and abilities. If there are circumstances that make our learning environment and activities difficult, if you have medical information that you need to share with me, or if you need specific arrangements in case the building needs to be evacuated, please let me know. I am committed to creating an effective learning environment for all students, but I can only do so if you discuss your needs with me as early as possible. I promise to maintain the confidentiality of these discussions. If appropriate, also contact Services for Students with Disabilities, 512-471-6259 (voice) or 1-866-329- 3986 (video phone). diversity.utexas.edu/disability/about

### COUNSELING AND MENTAL HEALTH CENTER
Do your best to maintain a healthy lifestyle this semester by eating well, exercising, avoiding drugs and alcohol, getting enough sleep and taking some time to relax. This will help you achieve your goals and cope with stress.

All of us benefit from support during times of struggle. You are not alone. There are many helpful resources available on campus and an important part of the college experience is learning how to ask for help. Asking for support sooner rather than later is often helpful.
 
If you or anyone you know experiences any academic stress, difficult life events, or feelings like anxiety or depression, we strongly encourage you to seek support. cmhc.utexas.edu/individualcounseling.html

### THE SANGER LEARNING CENTER
Did you know that more than one-third of UT undergraduate students use the Sanger Learning Center each year to improve their academic performance? All students are welcome to take advantage of Sanger Center’s classes and workshops, private learning specialist appointments, peer academic coaching, and tutoring for more than 70 courses in 15 different subject areas. For more information, please visit  ugs.utexas.edu/slc or call 512-471-3614 (JES A332).

### IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION
If you have concerns about the safety or behavior of fellow students, TAs or Professors, call BCAL (the Behavior Concerns Advice Line):  512-232-5050. Your call can be anonymous. If something doesn’t feel right – it probably isn’t. Trust your instincts and share your concerns.
TITLE IX REPORTING
Title IX is a federal law that protects against sex and gender-based discrimination, sexual harassment, sexual assault, sexual misconduct, dating/domestic violence and stalking at federally funded educational institutions. UT Austin is committed to fostering a learning and working environment free from discrimination in all its forms. When sexual misconduct occurs in our community, the university can:
1.	Intervene to prevent harmful behavior from continuing or escalating.
2.	Provide support and remedies to students and employees who have experienced harm or have become involved in a Title IX investigation. 
3.	Investigate and discipline violations of the university’s relevant policies.
Faculty members and certain staff members are considered “Responsible Employees” or “Mandatory Reporters,” which means that they are required to report violations of Title IX to the Title IX Coordinator. All instructors and TAs in this course are Responsible Employees and must report any Title IX related incidents that are disclosed in writing, discussion, or one-on-one. Before talking with any faculty or staff member about a Title IX related incident, be sure to ask whether they are a responsible employee. If you want to speak with someone for support or remedies without making an official report to the university, email advocate@austin.utexas.edu For more information about reporting options and resources, visit titleix.utexas.edu or contact the Title IX Office at titleix@austin.utexas.edu. 

### EVACUATION
The following recommendations regarding emergency evacuation are from the Office of Campus Safety and Security, 512-471-5767, operations.utexas.edu/units/csas. If you are attending class virtually from an on-campus location, these guidelines may help you in case of emergency.

Occupants of buildings on The University of Texas at Austin campus are required to evacuate buildings when a fire alarm is activated. Alarm activation or announcement requires exiting and assembling outside.

•	Familiarize yourself with all exit doors of each classroom and building you may occupy. Remember that the nearest exit door may not be the one you used when entering the building.
•	Students requiring assistance in evacuation shall inform their instructor in writing during the first week of class.
•	In the event of an evacuation, follow the instruction of faculty or class instructors. Do not re-enter a building unless given instructions by the following: Austin Fire Department, The University of Texas at Austin Police Department, or Fire Prevention Services office.
•	Information regarding emergency evacuation routes and emergency procedures can be found at this link: emergency.utexas.edu
