## Introduction

Our class meets on Mondays (Section 1: 12:30 â€“ 2:15 PM, Section 2: 2:30 - 4:30 PM), streaming online via our course website on Canvas.

The objective of this course if for you to gain the tools you need to tackle real-world problems from a quantitative perspective. We will be covering topics on regression modelling, causal inference, and predictive modelling. You will have the opportunity to be exposed to an array of different real-world examples, get hands-on experience in working with data, and improve your R coding skills for data science. 

Your success in this class is important to me. These are difficult times, and I am committed to making appropriate accommodations that meet your needs and also allows you to complete the requirements of this course. My goal is for you to learn everything you were hoping to learn in this class.

If you feel you are falling behind or that there are any aspects of this class that are preventing you from learning, reach out to me or a teaching assistant as soon as possible, so we can work something out. We also encourage you to reach out to the student resources available through UT, many of which are listed on this syllabus.
