# Notation Cheat-Sheet

Hopefully this cheat-sheet helps you to get more familiar with notation!

<tr class="odd">
<td><pre>$Y$</pre></td>
<td><p>In this class, we will be seeing it as the outcome variable (observed)</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><code>X</code></td>
<td><em>Covariate, independentent variable, etc. These variables are also observed in our data.</em></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>$\beta$</td>
<td>A population parameter (coefficient in the model); can refer to a treatment effect or **causal estimand** (if it's for the treatment variable!). It's <u>not observed</u> (but we can estimate it!)</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>$\hat{\beta}$</td>
<td>Estimated coefficient for the true $\beta$ (really, anything with a hat $\hat{.}$ is an estimate). This is obtained from our data (observed), and you can see it in R output!</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>$Y(z)$</td>
<td>Potential outcomes under treatment $Z=z$. Meaning, what would your outcome be if you were under treatment $z$?. This can <u>only be observed</u> if your actual treatment assignment is also $Z=z$ (and you can observe at most one of them).</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>$E[Y(0)]$</td>
<td>Expected value of the potential outcomes under control. Again, this is not observed for everyone (only for the control group)</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>$E[Y(0)|Z=1]$</td>
<td>Expected value of the potential outcomes under control *for individuals in the treatment group*. This is <u>not observed</u>! (It would be, in fact, the counterfactual for the treatment group).</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>$E[Y(0)|Z=0]$</td>
<td>Expected value of the potential outcomes under control *for individuals in the control group*. This is <u>observed</u>, and we can estimate it (again, think of $\hat{.}$) by taking the mean of the observed outcomes for the control group.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>$ATE = E[Y(1) - Y(0)]$</td>
<td>Average Treatment Effect (the average effect that an intervention has on a population). This is <u>not observed</u> (but we can estimate it under certain assumptions!).</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>$ATT = E[Y(1) - Y(0)|Z=1]$</td>
<td>Average Treatment Effect on the Treated (the average effect that an intervention has on the treatment group). This is <u>not observed</u> (but we can estimate it under certain assumptions!).</td>
</tr>
