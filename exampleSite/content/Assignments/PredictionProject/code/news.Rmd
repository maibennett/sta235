# Source Information

Data from:

K. Fernandes, P. Vinagre and P. Cortez. (2015. "A Proactive Intelligent Decision Support System for Predicting the Popularity of Online News". Proceedings of the 17th EPIA 2015 - Portuguese Conference on Artificial Intelligence, September, Coimbra, Portugal.

# Objective

The main objective is to create a model that accurately predicts the popularity of online news, measured as the number of "shares" on social media.

# Relevant Information:

- The articles were published by Mashable (www.mashable.com) and their content as the rights to reproduce it belongs to them. Hence, this dataset does not share the original content but some statistics associated with it. The original content be publicly accessed and retrieved using the provided urls.

- Acquisition date: January 8, 2015

- Number of Instances: 39797 (*M.B. Note: The original dataset has been slightly modified following the same patterns of the original data, for evaluation purposes.*) 

- Number of Attributes: 61 (58 predictive attributes, 3 non-predictive, 1 goal field) (*M.B. Note: The three non-predictive attributes are `url`, `timedelta`, and `id`*)
