## Prediction Project

### Instructions

- This is a **data challenge**, which means that the main task is to predict outcomes as accurately as possible by **training different models**.

- You will have two tasks: A classification task (`bankrupcytrain.csv`) and a regression task (`newstrain.csv`).

- **For each task**, you need to complete the following:

	- Use at least **two different methods** (that we have seen in class) to create two models *(for example, for a classification task, you could use KNN and Classification Trees)*.

	- Document the methods you have tried and choice of parameters. Explain why you chose the parameters you did, when appropriate.

	- Show your results with the appropriate plots and tables (these will depend on the methods you choose, but they are also useful to illustrate your choice of parameters!).

- **Include a section with attributable work**: This assignment can be in pairs, so you will need to include a brief section describing who did what *(Note: If you are doing the project by yourself, no need to include this section)*

- **Submit both your code and write up (as PDF)**: One important thing is that your code **has to be reproducible**. Don't make any changes to the original data outside your R script and remember to set a seed!

- How good your model is will be evaluated based on a **testing dataset** that only the instruction team has access to. Your grade will be partially dependent on the accuracy of your model. **Teams with the best accuracy/lowest error (RMSE) will receive the highest mark on this item**.

### Submission

Remember that you need to submit both a **written assignment** with your answers (pdfs only) and your **R code script**. Your assignment will be considered incomplete if you don't hand in both files.

**MAKE SURE YOUR R CODE IS REPLICABLE**
{{% /notice %}} 

- Load **all** packages you are using at the beginning of your script (follow the R scripts we see in class as an example).
- Don't edit **anything** in your data outside your script (everything should be done on the same R file).
- **Load the data from the URL provided**. Don't load csv files locally, if possible.

- Include **figures** and **tables** in your pdf write up, when appropriate.
- Be **clear** with your writing.
