## Instructions

- Submit your homework through Canvas before **Thursday October 14th 11:59 pm**. One submission per group.

- If you want to use your 24-hrs extension, complete **[this Google form](https://forms.gle/3HSsiZBAPSZ8rEYD7)** before the homework due date.

- Remember to submit your **write-up (only PDF extension) and your R script (.R or .Rmd)**. If both files are not submitted, the submission will be counted as incomplete until both files are received. *Note: Submit an R scrip in .R, not in PDF*

- Use the templates provided below to guide you on how your submissions should look like.

- **No need to write long answers**. Keep your answers short and precise, and address what is being asked (there are no additional points for answering something that is not being asked). Nonetheless, you need to be specific (e.g. it's not enough to say "there is a confounding problem"; you need to explain why you think that and give a specific example).

- Write a short paragraph at the end of the homework stating **each members' contribution to the assignment**. You can indicate, for example, if everyone participated in the overall discussion of the different questions, but also if one particular individual took the lead on a specific question.
