## Instructions

- Submit your homework through Canvas before **Thursday December 2nd 11:59 pm**. One submission per group.

- If you want to use your 24-hrs extension, complete **[this Google form](https://forms.gle/3HSsiZBAPSZ8rEYD7)** before the homework due date.

- Remember to submit your **write-up (only PDF extension) and your R script (.R or .Rmd)**. If both files are not submitted, the submission will be counted as incomplete until both files are received. *Note: Submit an R scrip in .R, not in PDF*

- Use the templates provided below to guide you on how your submissions should look like.

- **Do not provide overly-extended answers**. Keep your answers short and precise, and address what is being asked (there are no additional points for answering something that is not being asked, and there might even be discounts). Nonetheless, you need to be specific (e.g. if you are saying a model is higher variance, briefly explain why).

- Write a short paragraph at the end of the homework stating **each members' contribution to the assignment**. You can indicate, for example, if everyone participated in the overall discussion of the different questions, but also if one particular individual took the lead on a specific question.

- **Keep your write-up clean**. Formatting matters, so please (1) do not copy-paste all of your code and every output you get, only the ones that are strictly necessary to make your point, and (2) keep margins, fonts, spacing, etc. appropriate. This is a formal submission, so be aware of that!
