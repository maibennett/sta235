## Preliminary report

At this stage, you should have a solid research question, as well as the data to tackle that question. You should complete a preliminary report with appropriate tables and plots describing your research question and your data. The structure should be the following:

1) Introduction: Introduce your research question in a clear way and motivate it appropriately (*why should the reader care about this?*). Use citations to sustain your claims (e.g. reference similar research or data that supports your motivation).

2) Data description: Describe the data that you will be using to answer your research question. Use tables (e.g. balance tables or summary tables) and plots to show relevant relations or describe your variables (e.g. scatter plots for association between variables/ boxplots or histograms to show distributions of variables), accompanied by the main findings in your data. Examples of this would be (but not limited to): "In Table X, we can see that the treatment group is less vulnerable than the control group"; "Figure X shows that there is a strong and positive relation between Y and Z". **If you have too many variables, you don't need to describe every variable in your dataset**. Select the ones you think are more relevant (if you have too many) or the ones that you are going to use in your analysis, and focus on those ones.

3) Analysis plan: Create a clear roadmap of next steps in the analysis (e.g. how are you going to analyze your data? what are the main models you are going to use? are you going to conduct robustness tests? identify limitations?). You don't need any results for this section, you just need to map out your next steps and how your final report will look like.

### Instructions

Most groups will have to clean their data first. Please submit the code you use to clean your data and create the appropriate plots. Make sure your code is in order and runs.

**This is a report, so looks <u>do</u> matter**. Make sure your plots are legible and nice-looking (I suggest picking a color palette and sticking with that throughout your report). Save your plots or tables from R directly as png or other similar format instead of screenhots. Include captions and number all your tables and figures so you can reference them. Use an appropriate number of decimals (depending on what you measure, 1 might not be enough, but 4 or more is usually an overkill!). 

You must include at least one table and one plot (minimum) in your report, and no more than 5 figures + tables. <u>The report cannot exceed 2 pages of written text</u> (not counting tables and figures), using 11pt font and 1.15 spacing (min).

Check out the [Useful R Code](https://sta235.netlify.app/usefulrcode/sta235h_useful_r_code) material posted on the course website, to see how you can make good tables. Remember that your tables and plots always need to convay the message you want, so pay special attention to the labels, variable names, units, etc.
