# Final Project

## Objective

- The objective of the final project is for you to **apply what we've seen in the class to real-world data**. You get to choose the question you tackle!

- Successful projects should pose a novel and interesting/relevant question, have appropriate data to answer that question, and use pertinent analysis.

- Students have the option (and are encouraged!) to **reach out** at any time during the semester to get feedback about their project. Additionally, there are some milestones during the semester designed to provide feedback to students.

## Format

- The final project is a **group project** (3 to 4 students). Students are free to choose their own group, but will be assigned to one by the instructor if they haven't chosen one (or if their group doesn't comply with the requirements) by Sept 9th.

- The project should be tackled as a **team**, which means that students are expected to be in constant communication with their group. Failure to do so will have a significant penalty on the student's grade.

- There will be 4 submissions throughout the semester:

	1. Initial idea and data pitch
	2. Preliminary report
	3. Final report
	4. Presentation

## Submissions

### Initial idea and data pitch

You are asked to submit two to three ideas for the group project (<u>at least two</u>). Ideas can be overall general, but should tackle at least one of the areas we will see in this course: i) causal inference or ii) prediction.

- **Causal inference:** The question is focused on answering a causal question (e.g. "What is the effect of X on Y?"). It is ok if there are limitations to your analysis, as long as you are able to identify them and propose potential solutions.

- **Prediction:** Even though we will not cover prediction until week 10, you can definitely tackle a prediction problem (e.g. "Can I identify unsubcribers (before they unsuscribe) based on their characteristics?", "Can I predict the results for the midterms based on prior elections and current polls?").

At this stage, <u>you do not need to have full clarity on how you will tackle the question in terms of analysis</u>. The instruction team will provide appropriate feedback based on your ideas, and can guide you throughout the process. 

Make sure that your idea is grounded on data that you can obtain. There are many good ideas that unfortunately don't have pertinent data to be tackled, so make sure that whatever idea you have, you can accompany it with respective data. The instruction team will also provide feedback on whether the data is pertinent or not.

One relevant item in this submission is also **originality**. Make sure you are not copying another project or using the same idea another group is already working on.

**Pertinence:** The question at hand tackles one of the areas covered in this class and it is presented in a clear way.<br>
**Relevance:** Proper motivatation of why this question is relevant/interesting.<br>
**Originality:** The question is not a copy of another project already available and tackles an issue not addressed by another team in the class.<br>
**Peer assessment:** Students will be evaluated by their peers in terms of their contributions and responsiblity.

### Preliminary report

At this stage, you should have a solid research question, as well as the data to tackle that question.

### Final report

The final report should include everything that is included in the preliminary report (including the instructor's feedback), in addition to the finalyzed analysis.

**Research question:** The question at hand tackles one of the areas covered in this class, it is presented in a clear way, and it is motivated appropriately.<br>
**Data description:** Appropriate plots and tables showing the relevant data.<br>
**Analysis:** Pertinent analysis of the data to answer the research question. Includes some robustness checks (if appropriate) and limitations.<br>
**Conclusions:** Main takeaway points of the project.<br>

### Final presentations

Final presentations will be conducted during finals, and every student in the group has to be present, though only one (1) will present (it will be randomly selected). All students should be prepared to answer questions.

Presentations will be short presentations (5 minutes) followed by a couple of questions. All slides need to be submitted by Thursday Dec. 8th by noon.

**Presentation:** The slides show the main points of the project and convey the message in an appropriate way.<br>
**Presenter:** The presenter shows knowledge of the project and they are able to convey the information in the appropriate time.<br>
**Questions:** The group is able to answer the questions successfully.<br>
**Peer assessment:** Students will be evaluated by their peers in terms of their contributions and responsiblity.

## Where to get data

You can use any data you want (as long as it can be shared with the instruction team), but you need to describe how and where you obtained it from. Make sure your data is not *too* simple (e.g. too few variables, very small dataset), so you can run some interesting analysis on it. 

I'm also providing some resources here that can be useful if you don't know where to start:

- [#TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday): *A lot* of datasets that can be useful. Some of them are pared down, but usually you also have a link to the main data source.

- [Data Is Plural](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wZhPLMCHKJvwOkP4juclhjFgqIY8fQFMemwKL2c64vk/edit#gid=0): A long list of datasets that might be interesting.

- [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/)

- [Opportunity Insights](https://opportunityinsights.org/): Comprehensive datasets put together by the OI team, such as social capital, college mobility, economic tracker, etc.

- [Current Population Survey](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/cps/data.html): Survey created jointly by the Census Bureau and the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

- [Home Mortgage Disclosure Act](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/data-research/hmda/): Publicly available data on the US mortgage market.

- [Zillow data](https://www.zillow.com/research/data/): Many real estate platforms have some aggregated information available that could be interesting to analyze. You can merge their datasets with other datasets if you need more information (e.g. census data).

- Open data portals (e.g. [NYC restaurant inspection](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Health/DOHMH-New-York-City-Restaurant-Inspection-Results/43nn-pn8j)): Most cities and states have open data portals that allow you to download a lot of relevant data in different areas (e.g. education, health, crime, etc.)

- [YouTube API](https://support.google.com/youtube/contact/yt_researcher_certification?hl=en): This requires some API knowledge, and you need to submit an application for it, but really cool data if you want to dive into this.
