## Final presentations

Final presentations will be conducted during finals, and every student in the group has to be present, though only two (2) will present (they will be randomly selected). All students should be prepared to answer questions.

Presentations will be short presentations (**7 minutes**) followed by a couple of questions. All slides need to be submitted by Thursday Dec. 8th by noon.

Make sure your slides are **clear and visually appealing**. The audience should have a clear takeaway from each slide while you are presenting.

For a 7-minute presentation, I'd suggest having no more than 7 slides with content, or you might ran out of time. The timing will be enforced strictly, because we need to fit all groups. I would also encourage you to **practice, practice, practice** so you are sure your delivery is on point.

**This presentation does not require formal attire**
