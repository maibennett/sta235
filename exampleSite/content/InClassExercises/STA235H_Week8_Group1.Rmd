# Setup

In this fictitional scenario, imagine that Netflix is rolling out a policy to restrict access from multiple devices that are not from a verified subscriber. Their objective is to increase subscriptions by making it more difficult for people to share accounts. 

They implemented a pilot for this policy in California and New York at the end of May of 2022, and you have a panel of individuals that you surveyed both before (April 2022) and after the rollout (July 2022):

```{r}
netflix <- read.csv()
```
