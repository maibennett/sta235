# Setup

In this fictional scenario, imagine that Netflix is rolling out a policy to restrict access from multiple devices that are not from a verified subscriber. Their objective is to increase subscriptions by making it more difficult for people to share accounts. 

They implemented a pilot for this policy in California and New York at the end of May of 2022, and you have a panel of individuals that you surveyed both before (April 2022) and after the rollout (July 2022):

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)

netflix <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/maibennett/sta235/main/exampleSite/content/Classes/Week8/1_DiffInDiff/data/netflix.csv")
```

Here's the list of variables in your dataset:

- `id`: ID of the individual
- `state`: State
- `income`: Yearly income (in US$)
- `employed`: Whether the person is employed (1) or not (0)
- `female`: Female (1) or male (0)
- `subscribed`: Whether the person is subscribed to Netflix (1) or not (0)
- `survey`: Month and year of the survey (April2022 or July2022)
